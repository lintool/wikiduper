This article contains a historical '''timeline of the events of Hurricane Katrina'''.

==Formation==
{{refimprove|date=April 2013}}

===Tuesday, August 23, 2005===
Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the  Bahamas at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) on August 23, 2005, partially from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten, which had dissipated due to the effects of a nearby upper tropospheric trough. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic indicate that the old name/number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, much more advanced system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the upper troposphere weakened, causing the wind shear in the area to relax, thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop.{{confusing|date=November 2012}} In a later re-analysis, it was determined that the low-level circul Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.

==Gulf of Mexico==

===Friday, August 26, 2005===
At 1:00 AM [[EDT]], maximum sustained winds had decreased to {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and Katrina was again downgraded to a tropical storm. At 5:00 AM EDT, the eye of Hurricane Katrina was located just offshore of southwestern Florida over the Gulf of Mexico about 50&amp;nbsp;miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) north-northeast of [[Key West, Florida]]. Maximum sustained winds had again increased to 75&amp;nbsp;mph (121&amp;nbsp;km/h) and Katrina was upgraded again to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] hurricane.

In the early afternoon, the [[National Hurricane Center]] officially shifts the possible track of Katrina from the [[Florida Panhandle]] to the Mississippi/Louisiana coast. Governor [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]] declared a state of emergency for the state of Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, Kathleen. &quot;[http://www.ldi.state.la.us/whats_new/61PRO2005.pdf State of Emergency - Hurricane Katrina].&quot; ''[[Louisiana|State of Louisiana]].'' August 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration included activation of the state of Louisiana's emergency response and recovery program under the command of the director of the state office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness to supply emergency support services. Following the declaration of a state of emergency, federal troops were deployed to Louisiana to coordinate the planning of operations with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA).&lt;ref&gt;Kitfield, James. &quot;[http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=32146&amp;dcn=todaysnews Military's Northern Command steps up response efforts].&quot; ''[http://www.govexec.com/ Government Executive Magazine].'' September 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 922 Army National Guard and 8 Air National Guard are deployed.

By 11:00 PM EDT, the National Hurricane Center predicted that Hurricane Katrina would strike the town of [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]], 66&amp;nbsp;miles (106&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;forecasting&quot;&gt;Lush, Tamara. &quot;[http://www.sptimes.com/2005/08/30/State/For_forecasting_chief.shtml For forecasting chief, no joy in being right].&quot; ''[[St. Petersburg Times]].'' August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturday, August 27, 2005===
By 5:00 AM [[EDT]], Hurricane Katrina reached [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] intensity.

At 10:00 AM EDT, officials in [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana]], [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]], and [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]] ordered a mandatory evacuation of all of their residents. [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]] ordered voluntary evacuations, recommending that all residents evacuate, particularly those living in lower areas. Jefferson Parish officials did declare a mandatory evacuation for the coastal areas of [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]], [[Crown Point, Louisiana|Crown Point]], [[Lafitte, Louisiana|Lafitte]], and [[Barataria, Louisiana|Barataria]]. Tolls were suspended on the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] as well as the [[Crescent City Connection]], to speed up the evacuation process.

At 5:00 PM EDT, [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] [[Mayor]] [[Ray Nagin]] announced a state of emergency and a called for a voluntary evacuation. He added that he would stick with the state's evacuation plan and not order a mandatory evacuation until 30 hours before the expected landfall. This would allow those residents in low-lying surrounding parishes to leave first and avoid gridlocked escape routes. However, he did recommend that residents of low-lying areas of the city, such as [[Algiers, Louisiana|Algiers]] and the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|9th Ward]], get a head start. Nagin said the city would open the Superdome as a shelter of last resort for evacuees with special needs. He advised anyone planning to stay there to bring their own food, drinks and other comforts such as folding chairs. &quot;No weapons, no large items, and bring small quantities of food for three or four days, to be safe,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writers. &quot;[http://www.sptimes.com/2005/08/28/Weather/Katrina_on_path_west_.shtml Katrina on path west to hit La.].&quot; ''[[St. Petersburg Times]], August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Louisiana National Guard had delivered three truckloads of water and seven truckloads of MRE's to the Superdome, enough to supply 15,000 people for three days. 

[[Image:Fema827map.gif|frame|right|Map of Louisiana parishes eligible for assistance.]]
Governor Blanco sends a letter to [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] asking him to declare a major disaster for the State of Louisiana, in order to release federal financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, Anna. &quot;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/weather/july-dec05/katrina/fema_background.html FEMA Faces Intense Scrutiny].&quot; ''[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].'' September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Governor Blanco's request, President Bush declared a federal state of emergency in Louisiana under the authority of the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Stafford Act]], which provided a, &quot;means of assistance by the Federal Government to State and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result from such disasters,...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=4786 Emergency Aid Authorized For Hurricane Katrina Emergency Response In Louisiana].&quot; [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], August 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergency declaration provided for federal assistance and funding, as well as assigned, by law, the responsibility for coordinating relief efforts with those government bodies and relief agencies which agree to operate under his advice or direction, to the FEMA federal coordinating officer (FCO). It also provided for military assets and personnel to be deployed in relief and support operations, although the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] imposes strict limitations on the use of Active Duty soldiers in law enforcement. 1701 Army National Guard and 932 Air National Guard are deployed (2633 total).

That night, [[National Hurricane Center]] director [[Max Mayfield]] briefed President Bush, Governor Blanco, Governor [[Haley Barbour]] of [[Mississippi]], and Mayor Nagin on the status of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name=&quot;forecasting&quot;/&gt;

===Sunday, August 28, 2005===
Just after midnight, at 12:40 AM [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]] (0540 [[UTC]]), Hurricane Katrina reached [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] intensity with {{convert|145|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds. By 7:00 AM CDT (1200 UTC), it was a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] storm, with maximum sustained winds of {{convert|175|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, gusts up to {{convert|190|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and a central pressure of 902 [[mbar]].

In a press conference at roughly 10:00 AM CDT (1500 [[UTC]]), Nagin declared that &quot;a mandatory evacuation order is hereby called for all of the parish of Orleans.&quot; &quot;We're facing the storm most of us have feared,&quot; he told the early-morning news conference, with the governor at his side. Following Nagin's speech, Governor Blanco stated that President Bush called her &quot;just before&quot; the press conference and said that he was &quot;concerned about the [storm’s] impact&quot; and asked her &quot;to please ensure that there would be a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Press Conference. &quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/28/bn.04.html New Orleans Mayor, Louisiana Governor Hold Press Conference].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Katrina was expected to make landfall overnight.&lt;ref&gt;Glasser, Susan B.; Grunwald, Michael. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/10/AR2005091001529_pf.html The Steady Buildup to a City's Chaos].&quot; ''[[Washington Post]].'' September 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the meeting, at 10:00 AM CDT (1500 [[UTC]]), the [[National Weather Service]] issued a bulletin predicting &quot;devastating&quot; damage.&lt;ref&gt;National Weather Service. &quot;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/warn_archive/LIX/NPW/0828_155101.txt URGENT - WEATHER MESSAGE 1011 AM CDT SUN AUG 28 2005]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

At 12:00 PM CDT (1700 UTC), the Louisiana Superdome was opened as a, &quot;refuge of last resort,&quot; for those residents that were unable to obtain safe transport out of the city. 20,000 people entered the Dome. The Louisiana National Guard had delivered three truckloads of water and seven truckloads of MRE's to the Superdome, enough to supply 15,000 people for three days. 4444 Army National Guard and 932 Air National Guard are deployed (5,376 total).

President Bush declared a state of emergency in [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]],&lt;ref&gt;Press Release. &quot;[http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=4806 Alabama Hurricane Katrina Emergency Declaration].&quot; [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press Release. &quot;[http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=4787 Hurricane Katrina Emergency Declaration].&quot; [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].

==Third landfall==
[[Image:Katrina 2nd landfall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hurricane Katrina making its third landfall, near the [[Mississippi]]/[[Louisiana]] border.]]

===Monday, August 29, 2005===
At 5:10 AM [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]] (1010 [[UTC]]), Hurricane Katrina made its second landfall as a strong [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] hurricane near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]], with sustained winds of more than 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h), although Category 4 winds may have briefly affected the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;&gt;Knabb, Richard D.; Rhome, Jamie R. &quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Katrina].&quot; ''[[National Hurricane Center]].'' December 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Katrina also made landfall in St. Bernard parish and St. Tammany parish as a Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane for a total of three landfalls in Louisiana.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

By 8:00 AM CDT (1300 UTC), in New Orleans, water was seen rising on both sides of the [[Industrial Canal]]. 

At approximately 8:14 AM CDT (1314 UTC), the New Orleans office of the [[National Weather Service]] issued a [[Flash Flood Warning]] for Orleans Parish and St Bernard Parish, citing a levee breach at the Industrial Canal. The [[National Weather Service]] predicted three to eight feet of water and advised people in the warning area to &quot;move to higher ground immediately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first =Nicholas | authorlink =http://theplaceofdeadroads.blogspot.com | coauthors = | year =2005 | url =http://theplaceofdeadroads.blogspot.com/2005/09/noaanws-knew-of-levee-breach-morning.html | title =NOAA/NWS Knew of Levee Breach Morning of Monday 29th  | format =Blog | work = | publisher =The Place of Dead Roads | accessdate =2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 9:00 AM CDT (2100 UTC), there was 6–8&amp;nbsp;feet of water in the [[Lower Ninth Ward]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcquaid&quot;&gt;McQuaid, John [http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/mcquaid090805.html &quot;Anatomy of a Disaster].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhousenews.com/ Newhouse News Service]. September 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10:00 AM CDT (1500 UTC), Hurricane Katrina made its third landfall near [[Pearlington, Mississippi]] and Slidell, Louisiana, with sustained winds of 120&amp;nbsp;mph (193&amp;nbsp;km/h) after crossing Breton Sound. Also at 10:00 AM. while at a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] event in [[El Mirage, Arizona]], President Bush said, &quot;I want to thank the governors of the affected regions for mobilizing assets prior to the arrival of the storm to help citizens avoid this devastating storm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W. [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050829-5.html &quot;President Participates in Conversation on Medicare&quot; White House. August 29, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 11:00 AM CDT (1600 UTC), there was approximately 10&amp;nbsp;feet (3 m) of water in [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcquaid&quot;/&gt;  Many rooftops could not be seen here as they were submerged.  Therefore, there was much more than {{convert|10|ft|m}} of water in many places.

At 2:00 PM CDT (1900 UTC), New Orleans officials confirmed a breach of the [[17th Street Canal]] [[levee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcquaid&quot;/&gt;  There was also confirmation of breaches at two other canals.

In a press conference at 3:00 PM CDT (2000 UTC), New Orleans Homeland Security Director Terry Ebbertt stated that he was positive that there were casualties resulting from the storm, based on calls to emergency workers from people trapped in trees and homes. He said that, &quot;Everybody who had a way or wanted to get out of the way of this storm was able to. For some that didn't, it was their last night on this earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Dave.[http://www.nola.com/newslogs/breakingtp/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_Times-Picayune/archives/2005_08.html#074900] &quot;Ebbert expects casualties&quot; Times Picayune. August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Police were fanning out across the city to assess damage, rescue people, and get a good look at the situation before nightfall. The hardest-hit areas of the city were the [[Lower Ninth Ward]], New Orleans East, Gentilly, Lakeview, St. Bernard parish, and Plaquemines parish.

Governor Blanco ordered 68 school buses into New Orleans from surrounding parishes to begin evacuating any survivors that remained in the city. 6908 Army National Guard and 933 Air National Guard were deployed (7,841 total). Governor Blanco and the National Guard stated that they could &quot;handle it&quot;. FEMA Director [[Michael D. Brown|Michael Brown]] also urged local fire and rescue departments outside [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]] not to send trucks or emergency workers into disaster areas without an explicit request for help from state or local governments. Brown sought the approval from Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff five hours after landfall to dispatch 1,000 Homeland Security workers into the region. Brown acknowledged that this process would take two days. He described Katrina as a, &quot;near catastrophic event.&quot;

Brown defined the role of requested assigned personnel and additional aid from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]: &quot;Establish and maintain positive working relationships with disaster affected communities and the citizens of those communities. Collect and disseminate information and make referrals for appropriate assistance. Identification of potential issues within the community and reporting to appropriate personnel. Convey a positive image of disaster operations to government officials, community organizations and the general public. Perform outreach with community leaders on available Federal disaster assistance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael D. &quot;[http://wid.ap.org/documents/dhskatrina.pdf Memorandum to Michael Chertoff]&quot; FEMA (provided by the [[Associated Press]]).

==Aftermath==

===Tuesday, August 30, 2005===
At 12:00 PM [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]] (1700 [[UTC]]), [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] became aware that the New Orleans levee breaches could not be plugged.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcquaid&quot;/&gt; Governor [[Kathleen Blanco|Blanco]] ordered that all of New Orleans, including the Superdome, be evacuated due to the flooding of the city. She commandeered hundreds of buses from across Louisiana using her executive powers, and those buses eventually evacuated more than 15,000 people that were stranded in the city to the Superdome by Thursday, September 1.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, David. [http://www.nola.com/newslogs/breakingtp/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_Times-Picayune/archives/2005_08_31.html#075326] &quot;Blanco says evacuation buses on the way to N.O.&quot; Times Picayune. August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many instances of reported looting, including looting by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9131493/] &quot;Looters take advantage of New Orleans mess&quot; MSNBC. August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Blanco also said that she will request President Bush send federal troops to help restore law and order in New Orleans. 9,668 Army National Guard and 956 Air National Guard were deployed (10,624 total).

===Wednesday, August 31, 2005===

Hurricane Katrina is downgraded to a [[tropical depression]].

At 10:00 PM [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]] (0300 [[UTC]]), Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] announced that the planned sandbagging of the [[17th Street Canal]] levee breach had failed. At the time, 85% of the city was underwater.

Michael Chertoff released a memo to other cabinet members and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] stating that, &quot;the President has established the 'White House Task Force on Hurricane Katrina Response.' He will meet with us tomorrow to launch this effort.&quot; The memo also declared Hurricane Katrina to be an [[Incident of National Significance]] and designated Michael Brown, Under-Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response (EP&amp;R), as the Principal Federal Official (PFO) for incident management purposes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Landay, Jonathan S.; Young, Alison; McCaffrey, Shannon. [http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/12637172.htm] &quot;Chertoff delayed federal response, memo shows&quot;. Knight Ridder Newspapers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realcities.com/ realcities.com]. September 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In a national news conference presided over by Chertoff, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Administrator [[Stephen L. Johnson]] announces relaxation of Federal fuel and emissions standards in response to Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a162fa4bfc0fd2ef8525701a004f20d7/9d851309e61719a48525706e00678a23!OpenDocument Remarks by EPA Administrator Johnson - Waiver of EPA Standards for Gasoline and Diesel Fuels in Wake of Hurricane Katrina]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] was positioned off the coast of [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] to support the relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;DeVera, Joanne.[http://www.bataan.navy.mil/news/news33.htm &quot;CNO Visits Bataan During Hurricane Katrina Relief Efforts&quot; United States Navy.

August 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The number of National Guardsmen on duty in the Gulf Coast rose to approximately 8,300 [actually 10,428 Army National Guard and 960 Air National Guard were deployed - 11,388 total]. They remained under their respective governor's control, which enables them to provide law-enforcement support in the affected regions, which is prohibited [to the military] by the [[Posse Comitatus Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Donna. &quot;[http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050831_2576.html Military Providing Full-Scale Response to Hurricane Relief Effort].&quot; ''[[American Forces Information Service]].''

[[File:BUSHJACKET.jpg|thumb|right|250px|President Bush observes damage from [[Hurricane Katrina]] over [[New Orleans]], August 31.]]
President Bush returned early to Washington from vacationing at [[Prairie Chapel Ranch|his ranch]] in [[Crawford, Texas]]. Though he does not stop in Louisiana, [[Air Force One]] flies low over the Gulf Coast so that he can view the devastation in Air Force One. He later declared a Public Health Emergency for the Gulf Coast.

Mayor Nagin ordered almost the entire New Orleans' police force to abandon search and rescue missions and turn their attention toward controlling the widespread looting and a curfew is placed in effect.&lt;ref&gt;Nossiter, Adam. &quot;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20050901-0506-hurricanekatrina.html Superdome evacuations begin.]&quot; ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]].'' September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

State workers began work at closing the [[17th Street Canal]] breach, and the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] adds additional resources to the task.

At 11:00 PM [[EDT]] (0300 [[UTC]]), the [[National Hurricane Center]] announced that the center of the remnant low of what was Hurricane Katrina has been completely absorbed by a frontal boundary in southeastern [[Canada]], with no discernible circulation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/tcpat2.html Tropical Summary Message].&quot; ''Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.'' August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of the hurricane caused roads in northern [[Quebec]] to be rutted and eroded by heavy rainfall, isolating the north shore communities for several days.

[[BNSF Railway]] announced that it expected to restore limited freight service to southern [[Louisiana]] by September 1. Other than debris on the mainline, the biggest problem facing crews working to reopen the line is the damage to the Bayou Boeuf bridge in [[Morgan City, Louisiana]]. The bridge and bridge piers were struck by a [[barge]] propelled by the storm's winds and wave action. BNSF sent crews to repair damaged [[railway signal]] systems starting on August 30. BNSF transferred freight through other hubs such as [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] until service was restored.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release. &quot;[http://www.bnsf.com/employees/communications/bnsf_today/2005/08/2005-08-31-e.html Hurricane-Damaged Line Expected to Open Thursday].&quot; '[[BNSF Railway Company]].''

[[Norfolk Southern]] (NS) announced that the majority their mainlines that were damaged by Hurricane Katrina were again operational. They removed almost 3,700 fallen trees and inspected over 1,400 miles (2,253&amp;nbsp;km) of [[rail tracks|track]] before setting trains in motion. Tracks directly into [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], however, remained out of service due to [[washout]]s, continued [[flood]]ing, as well as the city's evacuation orders. Freight that would have normally transferred in New Orleans was routed to other terminals across the NS system. The company's experience with previous [[hurricane]]s helped it to prepare action plans before Katrina made landfall. They moved repair equipment, supplies and employees into nearby areas and quickly deployed them to inspect and repair the system after the storm passed.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release.[http://www.nscorp.com/nscorp/application;JSESSIONID_nscorp=DXhURA15pHPqeSCBD1fNApsGPWCdGoBvgHgAe6jFVD1N9F1BsuVu!1471091174?origin=content.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=NS+News&amp;contentId=english/nscorp/news/whats_new/whats_new/news083105b.html] &quot;Norfolk Southern Post-Katrina Operations Returning To Normal]&quot; Norfolk Southern.

U.S. Senate passes a relief package.

President Bush appeared on [[Good Morning America]], and said that he understood the frustration of Katrina victims, many of whom are still waiting for food, water, and other aid. &quot;I fully understand people wanting things to have happened yesterday,&quot; Bush said. &quot;I understand the anxiety of people on the ground. … So there is frustration. But I want people to know there's a lot of help coming.&quot; He said that the government's first priority is to save lives, and described the devastation that he saw while flying over the hardest-hit areas as, &quot;very emotional,&quot; but was also very optimistic about the prospects of New Orleans' recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Good Morning America]]. &quot;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=1086311&amp;page=1 Exclusive: Bush Says Focus Must Be on People].&quot; ''[[ABC News]].'' September 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A 50-member Canadian search-and-rescue team from [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] reached a flooded New Orleans suburb to help save trapped residents.

National Guardsmen accompanied by buses (475 in all) and supply trucks begin to arrive at the Superdome. 

A day after the National Guard (from [[Camp Beauregard]]) began delivering food, water and ice in New Orleans, the National President of the [[American Red Cross]], Marsha Evans, requested to set up a shelter in New Orleans to pass out food and water. However, due to the ongoing military rescue operations in the city at the time, the Red Cross was asked to wait for 24 hours. By Saturday, the point was moot because the large-scale evacuation of the city was already underway.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/08/katrina.redcross/index.html Red Cross: State rebuffed relief efforts].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, conditions at the Superdome, as well as the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, continued to deteriorate. Food and potable water were unavailable, with mostly false reports and rumors of rescuers coming under fire from people seeking to hijack supplies or transportation, and few buses were arriving to evacuate the survivors. About 5,000 refugees made it by bus to [[Reliant Astrodome]], yet there were only about 2,000 cots available.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Jack, Jr.; Dodd, Scott; Merzer, Martin.[http://www.timesleader.com/mld/timesleader/12533177.htm] &quot;Time running out for hurricane survivors&quot; The Times Leader. September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary Chertoff is criticized by [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s Robert Siegel during an interview on [[All Things Considered]], as he had no knowledge of the approximately 2,000 survivors at the Convention Center with no food or water. He said, &quot;I have not heard a report of thousands of people in the Convention Center who don't have food and water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Robert. &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4828771 U.S. Aid Effort Criticized in New Orleans].&quot; ''[[National Public Radio]]/[[All Things Considered]].''

September 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary Chertoff announced that 4,200 National Guard troops trained as military police would be deployed to New Orleans over the next three days. Governor Blanco requested the mobilization of an additional 40,000 National Guard troops. 14,284 Army National Guard and 972 Air National Guard were currently deployed (15,256 total).

California swift water rescue crew units deployed to the area rescued hundreds in New Orleans and [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]]. However, FEMA later halted the swift water rescue crews from conducting further rescues, citing safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/01/acd.01.html CNN Transcript: Anderson Cooper 360].&quot; ''[[CNN]].''

Sealing of the [[17th Street Canal]] from [[Lake Pontchartrain]] with sheet pilings begins, while closing the breach continues.

The New Orleans suburb of Gretna seals the [[Crescent City Connection]] bridge across the [[Mississippi River]], turning back fleeing flood victims at gunpoint. Evacuees blamed the incident on racism, but the chief of police stated that the city was in lockdown and was not equipped to handle evacuees from New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/13/katrina.bridge Racism, resources blamed for bridge incident].&quot; ''[[CNN]].''

The [[Kansas City Southern Railway]] reopened its [[Meridian Speedway]] railway line between [[Meridian, Mississippi]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], after clearing debris and repairing damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The line is also used by [[Norfolk Southern]] as a [[Arrangements between railroads|bridge route]] for NS [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] trains between the Meridian and [[Alliance, Texas]].

[[Image:BushVisitsBiloxi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|President George W. Bush meets victims of Hurricane Katrina on September 2, 2005, during his tour of [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]].]]
President Bush signed a [[United States Dollar|$]]10.5&amp;nbsp;billion relief package that was passed by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] which included supplemental funds for FEMA, as well as [[United States Dollar|$]]500&amp;nbsp;million for the Pentagon for its relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer.

September 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He also toured the hurricane-battered Gulf Coast, saying that he is ordering additional active duty forces to the region, and authorized a withdrawal of oil from the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve]].

The Bush administration sent Governor Blanco a proposed legal memorandum asking her to request a federal takeover of the evacuation of New Orleans. Louisiana officials eventually rejected the request after talks throughout the night, concerned that such a move would be comparable to a federal declaration of martial law.&lt;ref&gt;Roig-Franzia, Manuel; Hsu, Spencer. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090301680.html Many Evacuated, but Thousands Still Waiting].&quot; ''[[Washington Post]].''

Sheet piling blocks water flow into the [[17th Street Canal]], making closure of the breach not relevant to city flooding. Work on closing the breach continues for purposes of pumping.

In a letter to the governors of [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], [[BNSF Railway]] (headquartered in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]) pledged a contribution of [[United States dollar|$]]1&amp;nbsp;Million, and offered rail transportation to aid in relief efforts for the areas affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The monetary contribution came from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Foundation as a donation to the [[American Red Cross]] relief efforts, while the transportation assistance was organized by the [[Association of American Railroads]], the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the [[Federal Railroad Administration]], as well as other railroads that serve the area. The letter also stated that repairs to the Bayou Boeuf bridge were now completed and BNSF's mainline was reopened as originally planned at 6:00 PM [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CST]] on September 1.

Rescue workers said that there were still many, &quot;holdouts,&quot; who were not heeding the mandatory evacuation order first issued by Nagin on August 28. They were concerned about their property being looted, were unaware of the full extent of the disaster, worried about their pets, or concerned that conditions would be worse in the shelters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7846">[[Hurricane Katrina]] was the third most intense to hit the [[United States]] in [[recorded history]]. In the [[Atlantic basin]] it achieved the status of the fourth lowest [[central pressure]] ever recorded (currently sixth). Its 30&amp;nbsp;foot (10 m) [[storm surge]] recorded at [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] is the highest ever observed in [[North America]] [http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc/475890.html][http://www.msstate.edu/web/media/detail.php?id=3157].

==Rainfall==
Katrina produced slightly above average rains for a tropical cyclone, with nearly 16½&amp;nbsp;inches of rain falling between South Miami and Perrine in South Florida, with totals of up towards {{convert|15|in|mm}} in Louisiana.

A storm total rainfall map can be found here: [http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/katrina2005rain.gif]

==By death toll==
{{Katrina}}
[[Hurricane Katrina#Death toll (summary)|As of current tallies]], Katrina is either the fourth or fifth deadliest storm ever to hit the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;&gt;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf NHC Katrina report]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as the process of collecting and identifying bodies continues, the death toll may still rise into second place, above that of the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]].

Other storms that killed many people in the U.S. include:
*The [[1893 Sea Islands Hurricane]], which killed 1,000&amp;ndash;2,000 along the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]].
*The [[1893 Chenier Caminanda Hurricane]], which killed approximately 2,000 in southern [[Louisiana]].
*The [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], which killed an estimated 6,000&amp;ndash;12,000.
*The [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]], which killed at least 2,500 people in the U.S. and over 1,500 in the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Bahamas]].
*1957's [[Hurricane Audrey]], which killed 390, with up to 160 more never accounted for.
*1969's [[Hurricane Camille]], which killed 256.

Other deadly storms include:
*The [[Great Hurricane of 1780]], which killed 22,000 in the [[Lesser Antilles]].
*The [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], the deadliest tropical cyclone on record, which killed an estimated 500,000 people in [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]).
*1975's [[Typhoon Nina (1975)|Typhoon Nina]], which killed tens or hundreds of thousands of people in [[China]].
*The [[1991 Bangladesh cyclone]], which killed 150,000 people in [[Bangladesh]].
*1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]], the deadliest named Atlantic storm, which killed 11,000&amp;ndash;18,000 people in [[Honduras]] and neighboring areas of [[Central America]].

==Other USA city devastations/disasters==
Katrina also caused the first substantial devastation of a major American city since the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and subsequent fires. In September 1965, [[Hurricane Betsy]] lead to portions of New Orleans being submerged for a week, which caused an increase in the height of the levee system.

==Other disasters in New Orleans==
This is the greatest disaster in [[New Orleans]] since its founding in 1718.
New Orleans has a known history of frequent and recurrent brushes with hurricanes. On average, New Orleans has been brushed every 3.94 years. Direct hurricane hits have occurred every 13.4 years on average.([http://www.hurricanecity.com/city/neworleans.htm])

==Other levee and flood disasters==
No other levee breach in the USA has caused such a level of destruction or such an extensive evacuation.  However, devastation in other parts of the world, caused by levee breaches, has been greater.

*The [[Johnstown Flood]] in 1889 killed 2,200 people when the [[South Fork Dam]] burst, submerging the city of [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]].  The Johnstown flood was the first major peacetime relief effort for the [[Red Cross]].
* The [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] along the [[Mississippi River]] in 1927&amp;ndash;1928 killed 246 people, left approximately 700,000 homeless, and destroyed or damaged 137,000 buildings [http://www.aws.com/aws_2001/greatesthits/default.asp?CID=61]
* The [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]] breached levees around [[Lake Okeechobee]] in southern [[Florida]], causing flooding over hundreds of square miles and killing over 2,500.
* [[1931 Huang He flood]] and following levee breaches killed millions.
* The [[Great Flood of 1993]] along the Mississippi River killed 47 people, displaced approximately 74,000, and destroyed or damaged 47,650 buildings ([http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/flood/maps/]).

==Comparison to other evacuations/refugee crises==
Other cities which have been evacuated are:
* In 2002 severe flooding led to the evacuation of 50,000 residents of [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], on 14 August [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2192288.stm], with a total of 200,000 Czechs during the second August week. [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,610496,00.html].

* In January 2002, 300,000 residents of the city of [[Goma]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) were evacuated in 3&amp;nbsp;days due to the eruption of the volcano [[Nyiragongo]].[http://www.undp.org/bcpr/disred/documents/publications/casestudy/goma.pdf][http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/africa/nyiragongo.html][http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/48470b8ce15304b685256b6f0074d36a]

* In April 2001, 77,000 inhabitants (around 2/3 of the population) of the [[Italy|Italian]] city [[Vicenza]] were evacuated for several hours so that an unexploded bomb, originally dropped in World War II, could be safely disarmed. [http://english.people.com.cn/english/200104/30/eng20010430_69000.html]

Many representatives of the '''[[news media]] reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina''' became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Due to the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities.

==Media involvement==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Geraldo-Rivera-Katrina-Aftermath-FNC.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Geraldo Rivera]] reporting from the New Orleans Convention Center on September 2, 2005.]] --&gt;
Several reporters for various [[news agencies]] located groups of stranded victims, and reported their location via [[Communications satellite|satellite uplink]]. Authorities, who monitored the network news broadcasts, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the news reports. This was best illustrated when [[Shepard Smith]] and [[Geraldo Rivera]] of [[Fox News]], among others, reported thousands of people stranded at the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]]. Rivera tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or let the people leave. [[Geraldo Rivera]] went so far as to compare the convention center to [[Willowbrook State School]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2678976 Geraldo Rivera &amp; Shepard Smith Unleashed].&quot; -- ''Video.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many journalists also contributed to the spread of false rumors of lawlessness among the victims, which many have been interpreted as an instance of [[yellow journalism]]. Many news organizations carried the unsubstantiated accounts that murder and rape were widespread, and in some cases later repeated the claims as fact, without attribution. However, only one actual report of a raping occurred during the uproar.&lt;ref&gt;Thevenot, Brian; Russell, Gordon. &quot;[http://www.nola.com/newslogs/tporleans/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_tporleans/archives/2005_09_26.html#082732 Rumors of deaths greatly exaggerated].&quot; ''[[Times Picayune]].'' September 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the reports of rape and violence were based on statements made by New Orleans city officials, including the Chief of Police. Many officials later claimed these rumors often impeded the relief and rescue efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongressInvestigation&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author=[[United States Congress]] | date = February 19, 2006 | title = A Failure of Initiative: Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina | publisher = [[Government Printing Office]] | location = [[Washington, DC]] | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-04-10 |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/katrinareport/fullreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some issues of racial bias in media coverage began to surface as Caucasian flood victims were portrayed in one [[Agence France-Presse]] photo as &quot;finding&quot; supplies, while a black person was described in an [[Associated Press]] photo as &quot;looting&quot; supplies. The photographers later clarified the two stories, one claiming he witnessed the black person looting a flooded store, while the other photographer described the white people as finding the food floating in floodwaters. &lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara; Mikkelson, David. P. &quot;[http://www.snopes.com/katrina/photos/looters.asp Loot Loops].&quot; ''[[Snopes]].'' September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The image was widely reused on the internet in various modified forms, and was known as &quot;Lootie&quot;. This was also criticized as an example of pervasive racism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/racism09.htm |title=The Racisim of &quot;Lootie&quot; |accessdate=2007-05-31 |author=Vernellia R. Randall  |date=1997, revised April 29, 2006  |quote=it’s hard for the Majority group to see racism or subordination because everything seems okay to them }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news media, both traditional and Internet, also played a role in helping families locate missing loved ones. Many family members, unable to contact local authorities in the affected areas, discovered the fate of a loved one via an online photo or television video clip. In one instance, a family in Clearwater, Florida discovered their mother was still alive in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi after seeing a photo of her on [http://www.tampabaystart.com/index.html TampaBayStart.com], a regional news site.

The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of [[Website|Internet sites]]—especially [[blogging]] and community journalism. One example was the effort of ''NOLA.com'', the web affiliate of New Orleans' ''[[The Times-Picayune|Times-Picayune]]'', which was awarded the Breaking News [[Pulitzer Prize]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulitzer BN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners - Breaking News Reporting | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2006/breaking-news-reporting/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060704034448/http://pulitzer.org/year/2006/breaking-news-reporting/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based ''[[The Sun Herald|Sun Herald]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulitzer PS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners - Public Service | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2006/public-service/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060708033740/http://pulitzer.org/year/2006/public-service/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams—from individuals to the Coast Guard—which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;OJR NOLA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Mark Glaser | title = NOLA.com blogs and forums help save lives after Katrina | date = September 13, 2005 | publisher = Online Journalism Review | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050913glaser/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulitzer speech&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Paul Steiger]] | title = Remarks at Pulitzer Prize luncheon | date = May 22, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | publisher = The Pulitzer Board | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/resources/steigerspeech.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060706085721/http://pulitzer.org/resources/steigerspeech.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restrictions on the media==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KATUTVCar.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gaffer's tape identifies journalists to police and military personnel.]] --&gt;
As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media.

On September 9, Lt. Gen. [[Russel L. Honoré]], the military leader of the relief effort, announced that reporters would have &quot;zero access&quot; to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Media Ban&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/09/10/katrina.media/ U.S. won't ban media from New Orleans searches].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Brian Williams]] also reported that in the process of blocking journalists, police even went so far as to threaten reporters with a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Howard. &quot;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002482207_katmedia09.html Restrictions irk media members covering storm].&quot; ''[[The Seattle Times]].'' September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at refugee centers such as the [[Houston Astrodome]], press activity was extensive. Immediately following the government decision, [[CNN]] filed a [[lawsuit]] and obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] against the federal ban. The next day, spokesperson Col. Christian E. deGraff announced that the government would no longer attempt to bar media access to the victim recovery efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Media Ban&quot;/&gt;

On September 7, [[KATU]] journalist Brian Barker reported that his team was threatened with automatic weapons by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] until they were identified by Brig. Gen. Doug Pritt, commander of the [[41st Brigade Combat Team]] of Oregon, the unit they were embedded with.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Brian. &quot;[http://www.katu.com/news/story.asp?ID=79436 Brian Barker's weblog from New Orleans].&quot; ''[[KATU]].'' September 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, his team taped the letters &quot;TV&quot; on the side of their vehicles in accordance with standard practice in war zones.

[[Toronto Star]] staff photojournalist Lucas Oleniuk was thrown to the ground by police in the [[French Quarter]] after taking several photographs, including pictures of a firefight between looters and police and the subsequent alleged beating of a looter by the police. The police attempted to take all of his equipment, however he convinced them to just take his camera's memory cards. In a separate incident, freelance photojournalist Marko Georgiev took photos of a body presumably shot and killed by the police. Police then pointed their weapons at the car and ordered the journalists out. They proceeded to search the car and confiscated one of Georgiev's memory cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This picture comes from an EPA website from a report that was prepared by U.S.Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.  There is no photographer given so I assume that it was taken by a government employee. 

This shows the compromised tank that floated off of its moorings in the flood waters that were caused by Hurricane Katrina.

}} The '''meteorological history of [[Hurricane Katrina]]''', an extremely destructive [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], began on August 23, 2005 when it originated as [[Tropical cyclone#Classifications, terminology, and naming|Tropical Depression]] Twelve near the [[Bahamas]]. The next day, the tropical depression strengthened to a [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm]], and was named ''Katrina''; it proceeded to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the southern tip of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]] as a minimal hurricane.

In passing across Florida, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] did not attain any more strength but did manage to maintain hurricane status. After passing over Florida, the warm waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] allowed it to [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensify]] to the sixth strongest [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]] in recorded history. Afterward, Katrina made landfall as a Category&amp;nbsp;3 storm near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]], and once more near the [[Mississippi]]/[[Louisiana]] border. Katrina progressed northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the [[Great Lakes]], when it was absorbed by a [[cold front]].

==Formation==
{{Spoken Wikipedia|Meteorlogical histor-125256.ogg|2007-06-11}} 
Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern [[Bahamas]] at 5:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (2100 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on August 23, 2005, partially from the remains of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]], which had dissipated due to the effects of a nearby upper [[troposphere|tropospheric]] [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] indicate that the old name/number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second [[tropical wave]] combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of [[Puerto Rico]] to form a new, much more advanced system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC disc 001&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Stewart, Stacy | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al122005.discus.001.shtml | title = Tropical Depression Twelve, Discussion No. 1, 5:00 p.m. EDT | date=August 23, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the trough in the upper troposphere weakened, causing the [[wind shear]] in the area to relax, thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later re-analysis, it was determined that the low-level circulation of Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;&gt;Knabb, Richard D.; Rhome, Jamie R. &quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Katrina].&quot; ''[[National Hurricane Center]].'' December 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hurricane Katrina August 25 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Katrina before making landfall in [[Florida]].]]
As the atmospheric conditions surrounding Tropical Depression Twelve were favorable for [[Tropical cyclogenesis|tropical development]], the system began to intensify and was upgraded to Tropical Storm ''Katrina'' on the morning of August 24. A burst of [[convection]] allowed Katrina to become the fifth hurricane of the 2005 season on August 25, only two hours before it made landfall around 6:30 p.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (2230 [[UTC]]) between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]], [[Florida]]. Katrina struck the peninsula with 80&amp;nbsp;mph (130&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds, and had a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] on [[NEXRAD]] [[weather radar]], which remained intact throughout its passage over Florida. Parts of the [[Florida Keys]] experienced tropical storm winds throughout August 26, with the [[Dry Tortugas]] briefly experiencing hurricane-force winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

==Gulf of Mexico==
The initial [[National Hurricane Center]] forecasts predicted that Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, eventually to hit the [[Florida Panhandle]] approximately three to four days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC disc 005&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Stewart, Stacy | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Tropical Storm Katrina Discussion No. 5, 5:00 p.m. EDT | date = August 24, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al122005.discus.005.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katrina, however, continued a westerly and west-southwesterly track, which eventually shifted the forecast track westward to New Orleans.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC disc 014&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Stewart, Stacy | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Hurricane Katrina Discussion No. 14, 5:00 p.m. EDT | date = August 26, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al122005.discus.014.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Katrina vs sea surface height.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hurricane Katrina encountering the Gulf [[Loop Current]].]]

Immediately after the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, the low [[wind shear]], good upper-level outflow, and the warm [[sea surface temperatures]] of the [[Loop Current|Gulf Loop Current]] caused Katrina to [[rapid deepening|intensify rapidly]]. On August 27, the storm was upgraded to Category&amp;nbsp;3 intensity,&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC pa 016&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Knabb, Richard | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Hurricane Katrina Advisory No. 16, 5:00 a.m. EDT | date = August 27, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public.016.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the third major hurricane of the season. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] disrupted the intensification of maximum winds for about 18&amp;nbsp;hours, but almost doubled the radius of the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; A second period of rapid intensification started by 7:00 p.m. CDT on August 27, and by 12:40 a.m. CDT on August 28, Katrina was upgraded to a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145&amp;nbsp;mph (233&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC pa 020&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Knabb, Richard | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Hurricane Katrina Advisory No. 20, 1:00 a.m. CDT | date = August 28, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public.020.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a Category&amp;nbsp;5 (the first in the Gulf of Mexico since [[Hurricane Allen]] 25 years prior) storm by 7:00 a.m. CDT,&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC pa 022&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Knabb, Richard | coauthors = Richard Pasch | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Hurricane Katrina Special Advisory No. 20, 7:00 a.m. CDT | date = August 28, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public.022.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; twelve hours after the beginning of the second round of rapid intensification, and reached its peak intensity at 1:00 p.m. CDT with maximum sustained winds of 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h), gusts of 215&amp;nbsp;mph (344&amp;nbsp;km/h) and a central pressure of 902&amp;nbsp;[[mbar]] (26.64&amp;nbsp;[[inHg]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC pa 023a&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Pasch, Richard | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Hurricane Katrina Intermediate Advisory No. 23a, 1:00 p.m. CDT | date = August 28, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public_a.023.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum pressure made Katrina, at the time, the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (Hurricanes [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] would later surpass Katrina that same year).&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;  As the hurricane approached New Orleans, the Weather Forecast Office in Slidell, Louisiana issued [[National Weather Service bulletin for New Orleans region|two strongly worded warnings]] of the storm's danger.

By the afternoon of August 28, the storm was large enough that some areas of the [[Gulf Coast]] were already experiencing tropical storm-force winds. The center of Katrina was about 180&amp;nbsp;statute miles (290&amp;nbsp;km) from the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], but tropical storm-force winds extended 230&amp;nbsp;mi (370&amp;nbsp;km) from the center of the storm, and hurricane-force winds extended about 105&amp;nbsp;miles (170&amp;nbsp;km) away.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC pa 024&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Pasch, Richard | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Hurricane Katrina Advisory No. 24, 4:00 p.m. CDT | date = August 28, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public.024.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnight on August 29, and into the morning of the next day, Katrina quickly weakened (in terms of maximum sustained winds) as it began to enter another eyewall replacement cycle. The inner eyewall deteriorated before an outer eyewall had fully formed, playing an important role in the weakening. In 18&amp;nbsp;hours, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds decreased from 170&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h) to 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; However, storm surge remained high at landfall because large waves greater than 30&amp;nbsp;feet (9.1&amp;nbsp;m) in height were generated beforehand (with a [[buoy]] recording a 55&amp;nbsp;ft/16.7&amp;nbsp;m wave at sea), when Katrina was at Categories 4 and 5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. The waves then combined with the storm surge of the large Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

==Second and third landfalls==
{{See also|Hurricane Katrina effects by region}}

[[Image:Katrina Arrival Animation.ogv|thumb|right|300px|Satellite imagery of Hurricane Katrina making landfall.]]

Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT on August 29 as a Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]]. Because Katrina had just weakened from Category&amp;nbsp;4 and due to the shape of the coastline, sustained Category&amp;nbsp;4 winds likely existed on land while the eye was over water. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended 120&amp;nbsp;miles (190&amp;nbsp;km) from the center, the storm's pressure was 920&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.17&amp;nbsp;inHg), and its forward speed was 15&amp;nbsp;mph (24&amp;nbsp;km/h). As it made its way up the eastern Louisiana coastline, most communities in [[Plaquemines]], [[St. Bernard Parish]], and [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] in [[St. Tammany Parish]] were severely damaged by storm surge and the strong winds of the eyewall, which also grazed eastern New Orleans, causing in excess of $1&amp;nbsp;billion worth of damage to the city (see [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans]]).

Original estimates indicated that Katrina had made this landfall as a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane, with 135&amp;nbsp;mph (220&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC pa 026b&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Pasch, Richard | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Hurricane Katrina Intermediate Advisory No. 26b, 8:00 a.m. CDT | date = August 29, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public_b.026.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, as indicated above, the storm weakened just before landfall to Category&amp;nbsp;3 intensity. The reasons for this weakening are not completely known yet; while the eye-wall replacement cycle played a part, slightly increasing [[wind shear|shear]], dropping sea-surface temperatures, dry air on the western [[semicircle]] of the storm and interaction with the continental landmass also may have played a role in weakening the cyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; This follows the trend of previous strong cyclones in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]: all cyclones with [[atmospheric pressure|minimum central pressures]] of 973&amp;nbsp;mbar (28.73&amp;nbsp;inHg) or less have weakened over the 12&amp;nbsp;hours before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

A few hours later, after weakening slightly, Katrina made its third landfall near the Louisiana&amp;ndash;Mississippi border with 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h) sustained winds and 928&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.37&amp;nbsp;inHg) pressure, still at Category&amp;nbsp;3 intensity. Its minimum pressure at its second landfall was 920&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.17&amp;nbsp;inHg), making Katrina the third strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States, behind [[Hurricane Camille]]'s 909&amp;nbsp;mbar (26.85&amp;nbsp;inHg) reading in 1969, and the [[1935 Labor Day Hurricane]]'s 892&amp;nbsp;mbar (26.35&amp;nbsp;inHg) record.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Hurricane Katrina LA landfall radar.gif|thumb|250px|left|Radar image of Hurricane Katrina making its second and third landfalls.]]

Because the storm was so large, highly destructive eye-wall winds and the strong northeastern quadrant of the storm pushed record [[storm surge]]s onshore, smashing the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast, including towns in Mississippi such as [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]], [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]], [[Long Beach, Mississippi|Long Beach]], [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]], [[Gautier, Mississippi|Gautier]] and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]], and, in Alabama, [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou La Batre]]. The surges peaked at 28&amp;nbsp;feet (8.5&amp;nbsp;m) in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], and at 13&amp;nbsp;feet (4.0&amp;nbsp;m) as far away as [[Mobile, Alabama]], which saw its highest storm surge since 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; Storm surge was particularly high due to the [[hydrology]] of the region, the hurricane's extreme size, and the fact that it weakened only shortly before landfall. As Katrina moved inland diagonally over Mississippi, high winds cut a swath of damage that affected almost the entire state.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Demise==
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina after landfall MODIS.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Katrina following its third landfall, but still at hurricane strength, over southern Mississippi]]

Katrina maintained hurricane strength well into [[Mississippi]], but weakened thereafter, losing hurricane strength more than 150&amp;nbsp;miles (240&amp;nbsp;km) inland, near [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. It was downgraded to a [[tropical depression]] near [[Clarksville, Tennessee]] and broke in half.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC pa 031&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Avila, Lixion | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Tropical Depression Katrina Advisory No. 31, 10 a.m. CDT | date = August 30, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-09-16 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public.031.shtml? | authorlink = Lixion Avila}}&lt;/ref&gt; One half continued to race northward, affecting the [[Central United States]] along its path, and was last distinguishable in the eastern [[Great Lakes]] region on August 31. On August 31, Katrina was absorbed by a frontal boundary and became a powerful extratropical low, causing 1.97–6.69&amp;nbsp;inches (50–170&amp;nbsp;mm) of rain in 12&amp;nbsp;hours, as well as gale-force wind gusts from 31 to 61&amp;nbsp;mph (50 to 98&amp;nbsp;km/h) in southeastern [[Quebec]] and northern [[New Brunswick]]. In the region of [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean|Saguenay]] and [[Côte-Nord]], rain caused breakdowns and failure in roads. The Côte-Nord region was isolated from the rest of Quebec for at least 1&amp;nbsp;week. The other half of Katrina broke off in the eastern part of the [[Appalachians]], primarily leading to a significant [[tornado outbreak]] in the area from central [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to central [[Pennsylvania]], killing two people and causing millions of dollars in additional damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

At 11:00 p.m. EDT on August 31, the center of the remnant low of what was Katrina had been completely absorbed by a frontal boundary in southeastern Canada, with no discernible circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;HPC pa 037&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/archive/0509/05090100 | title = Public Advisory 37 for the Remnants of Katrina, 11 p.m. EDT | date = August 31, 2005 | publisher = [[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]] | accessdate = 2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;CHC disc 2006-08-31T0800&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20050831114442.Katrina.txt.en | title = Post-Tropical Storm Katrina Information Statement, 08:00 a.m. EDT | publisher = [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]] | date = August 31, 2005 | accessdate=2006-09-19 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060716042249/http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20050831114442.Katrina.txt.en &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate = 2006-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various political and religious leaders have suggested that [[Hurricane Katrina]], which killed 1,836 people, was sent as a [[divine retribution]] for the [[sin]]s of [[New Orleans]], or of the [[Southern United States|South]], or for the [[United States]] as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHHW&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Michael Eric Dyson]] |coauthors= |title=Come Hell or High Water: Hurricane Katrina and the Color of Disaster |year=2006 |publisher=[[Basic Civitas Books]]|pages=178–202 |quote= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JXVwa-WOk9wC&amp; |isbn=0-465-01761-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GD&quot;&gt;Douglas Brinkley, ''The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast'' (2006), p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt; New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] is said to have asserted in a speech on January 16, 2006, addressing the effects of Hurricane Katrina, &quot;Surely God is mad at America&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GD&quot;/&gt; Various different reasons have been given for God's wrath. Some victims of the disaster also made attributions to supernatural causes, that they were being punished for their sins, or that God was testing them, or even that the event was &quot;the work of [[Satan]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9206991/ Some evacuees see religious message in Katrina], ''MSNBC''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure to support Israel==
[[Ovadia Yosef]], a prominent [[ultra-Orthodox]] Israeli rabbi, declared that Hurricane Katrina to be &quot;God's punishment for President Bush's support of the August 2005 withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHHW&quot;/&gt; He added that black people died because they did not study the Torah:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a [[tsunami]] and there are terrible natural disasters, because there isn’t enough Torah study... Black people reside there [New Orleans]. Blacks will study the Torah? [God said], Let’s bring a tsunami and drown them... Hundreds of thousands remained homeless. Tens of thousands have been killed. All of this because they have no God... Bush was behind the [expulsion of] Gush Katif, he encouraged Sharon to expel Gush Katif... We had 15,000 people expelled here [in Israel], and there [in America] 150,000 [were expelled]. It was God's retribution. God does not short-change anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3138779,00.html |title=Rabbi: Hurricane punishment for pullout] |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=7 September 2005 |author=Zvi Alush}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=11367 |title=Nature’s Wrath, Or God’s |archivedate=20 November 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051120105659/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=11367 |date=16 September 2005 |publisher=[[The Jewish Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Jerusalem Newswire'', a [[Christian Zionist]] online news service, ran an editorial headlined &quot;Katrina— The Fist of God?&quot;
&lt;ref name=&quot;EAI&quot;&gt;Stephen Spector, ''Evangelicals and Israel: The Story of American Christian Zionism'' (2009), p.154-55. ISBN 0-19-536802-9.&lt;/ref&gt; stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For six days thousands of weeping people were pulled and carried from their homes. While this was taking place, a small tropical depression was forming near the Bahamas.... That small depression had turned into a frightening fiend.... Is this some sort of bizarre coincidence? Not for those who believe in the God of the Bible.... The Bible talks about Him shaking his fist over bodies of water and striking them. While the &quot;disengagement&quot; plan was purportedly the brainchild of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,  the United States of America has for more than a decade been the chief sponsor and propeller of a diplomatic process that has dangerously weakened Israel... the Sharon disengagement plan was something that was forced on Israel, primarily by the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;EAI&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was echoed shortly thereafter by the Jerusalem based Christian Friends of Israel, which wrote, &quot;we know that God only disciplines his own. Perhaps there are enough good men left in the United States that God thinks it worthwhile to send an occasional reminder not to tamper with the Land that He calls His own&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EAI&quot;/&gt;

Evangelical [[Jack Chick]] produced a [[chick tract]] entitled ''Somebody Angry?'' which also explained the hurricane as a sign of God's wrath over US pressure on Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1055/1055_01.asp ''Somebody Angry?'', 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on Al-Qaeda==
[[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]] declared of the hurricane that &quot;God attacked America, and the prayers of the oppressed were answered&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHHW&quot;/&gt;

==Racism==
Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]] asserted that Hurricane Katrina was &quot;God's way of punishing America for its warmongering and racism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHHW&quot;/&gt; Said Farrakhan, &quot;Maybe God ain't pleased. Maybe this caste system that pits us against each other has to be destroyed and something new and better put in its place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CHHW&quot;/&gt;

==Sexual immorality and abortion==
[[File:FloridaAvChurch2.jpg|thumb|right|One of the hundreds of churches and other places of worship in New Orleans devastated by what some consider divine wrath.]]
Less than two weeks after the Hurricane, [[Pat Robertson]] implied on the September 12th broadcast of ''[[The 700 Club]]'' that the Hurricane was God's punishment in response to America's abortion policy. He suggested that [[9/11]] and the disaster in New Orleans &quot;could... be connected in some way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;First Read, NBC: [http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2010/01/13/4436174-robertson-on-haiti-pact-to-the-devil?lite Robertson on Haiti: 'Pact to the devil'].  January 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Steve Lefemine expressed a similar view, stating that &quot;In my belief, God judged New Orleans for the sin of shedding innocent blood through [[abortion]].... Providence punishes national sins by national calamities.... Greater divine judgment is coming upon America unless we repent of the national sin of abortion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3338642 Some say natural catastrophe was 'divine judgment'], ''Houston Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerhard Maria Wagner]], briefly an auxiliary bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz|Linz]],  attributed Hurricane Katrina to God's ire caused by the town's reputation for lax sexual behavior, claiming that the hurricane destroyed brothels, nightclubs and abortion clinics: &quot;It's no coincidence that in New Orleans all five abortion clinics as well as night clubs were destroyed.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_11598968 Cleric whose Katrina comment caused stir promoted;] Veronika Oleksyn, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/01/rev-gerhard-maria-wagner-_n_162920.html Wagner appointment in ''Huffington Post'';] [http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=11485 Controversial Austrian priest now a bishop.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Gill (columnist)|James Gill]], columnist for the New Orleans ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', satirically called for the Pope next to elevate Wagner as [[Archdiocese of New Orleans|Archbishop of New Orleans]] after protests from [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] in three New Orleans congregations over the merging of their churches by aging Archbishop [[Alfred Clifton Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/gill/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1233728403253000.xml&amp;coll=1 &quot;Holy Nutcase!&quot;] (''Times-Picayune'', 2009 February 4, p. B7).&lt;/ref&gt;  The churches had been depopulated in part by out-migration resulting from Hurricane Katrina. Elevated by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on January 31, 2009, Wagner resigned on February 15, 2009 amidst criticism, in part over his views of Hurricane Katrina.

American evangelist [[John Hagee]] linked the hurricane to a gay pride event known as &quot;[[Southern Decadence|Southern Decadence Day]]&quot;, which was to have been held in the town's French Quarter a few days after the hurricane hit. He said in 2006, &quot;I believe that New Orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to God, and they are — were — recipients of the judgment of God for that. The newspaper carried the story in our local area, that was not carried nationally, that there was to be a homosexual parade there on the Monday that the [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] came.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NPR: [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6097362 Pastor John Hagee on Christian Zionism.]  September 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/02/28/hagee/index.html Some hateful, radical ministers—white evangelicals—are acceptable]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on April 25, 2008, Hagee backed away from his comments regarding Hurricane Katrina by saying, &quot;But ultimately neither I nor any other person can know the mind of God concerning Hurricane Katrina. I should not have suggested otherwise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/04/hagee_retracts.html '''Boston Globe''', ''Hagee Retracts Katrina Comment'', by Foon Rhee on April 25, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; In rebuttal, [[About.com]]'s &quot;Urban Legends and Folklore&quot; section&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/b/a/2005_08_31.htm Urban Legends]&lt;/ref&gt; entitled &quot;Hurricane Katrina: God's Punishment for a 'Wicked' City?&quot; points out that the hurricane occurred ''before'' the parade and that the French Quarter was one of the ''least'' devastated parts of the city.

==False claim of assertion by Pat Robertson==
Evangelist [[Pat Robertson]] was falsely credited with having asserted that God sent Hurricane Katrina as punishment for the selection of [[Ellen DeGeneres]] to host the [[Emmy Awards]]. A ''Dateline Hollywood'' article satirically purported that Robertson had stated: &quot;By choosing an [[Coming out|avowed]] [[lesbian]] for this national event, these [[Hollywood]] elites have clearly invited God’s wrath.... Is it any surprise that the Almighty chose to strike at Miss Degeneres’ hometown?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://datelinehollywood.com/archives/2005/09/05/robertson-blames-hurricane-on-choice-of-ellen-deneres-to-host-emmys/ Dateline Hollywood » Blog Archive » ROBERTSON BLAMES HURRICANE ON CHOICE OF ELLEN DEGENERES TO HOST EMMYS]&lt;/ref&gt; Because Robertson had made similar pronouncements in the past, this was believed by many to be a factual report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/katrina/satire/robertson.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: God's Wrath]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] referred to this ''Dateline Hollywood'' article in his book, ''[[The God Delusion]]'', stating that Robertson &quot;was reported as blaming the hurricane on a lesbian comedian who happened to live in New Orleans&quot;, and that although it was &quot;unclear&quot; whether the story was true, it was &quot;widely believed, no doubt because it is entirely typical of utterances by evangelical clergy, including Robertson, on disasters such as Katrina&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The tremendous destruction caused by recent [[Atlantic Ocean]] [[tropical cyclone]]s, such as Hurricanes Katrina and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]], caused a substantial upsurge in interest in the subject of [[global warming]] by news media and the wider public, and concerns that global [[climatic change]] [[Effects of global warming|may have played a significant role]] in those events. ''[[Time Magazine]]'', for example, published an article titled, &quot;Is Global Warming Fueling Katrina?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kluger, [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1099102,00.html Is Global Warming Fueling Katrina?], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Monday, August 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; — however, the article itself addressed hurricanes in general, rather than Katrina specifically, and was inconclusive.

Shortly after the hurricane, former ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reporter [[Ross Gelbspan]] wrote an op-ed piece for the ''Globe'' titled, [http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=5444&amp;method=full &quot;Katrina's Real Name&quot;], declaring that the hurricane's &quot;real name is global warming.&quot; Gelbspan went on to assert:
:&quot;Although Katrina began as a relatively small hurricane that glanced off [[south Florida]], it was supercharged with extraordinary intensity by the relatively blistering [[sea surface temperatures]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&quot;
Gelbspan did not single out Katrina from other recent storms in that regard; in the article he went on to attribute other major weather events over the preceding year to global warming, including a [[blizzard]] in [[Los Angeles]], high winds in [[Scandinavia]], [[wildfire]]s in [[Spain]], and a [[drought]] centered in [[Missouri]].

Britain's then deputy prime minister, [[John Prescott]], has linked Katrina with global warming,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/katrina/story/0,16441,1567348,00.html Prescott links global warming to Katrina], ''Guardian Unlimited''.&lt;/ref&gt; and statements made shortly after the hurricane by Germany's environment minister, [[Jürgen Trittin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200508%5CPOL20050831a.html German Minister Links Katrina to Global Warming, Bush Policies], CNS news, 08/31/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate he believes that global warming is responsible for an increase in the frequency of destructive natural events.

[[Kerry Emanuel]] had recently published a paper in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/NATURE03906.pdf paper], ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature03906.html Nature]''.&lt;/ref&gt; that found a good correlation between hurricane intensity and sea surface temperatures. Some journalists have claimed Emanuel's paper concludes that the recent increase in intense Atlantic storms is due to global warming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Tropical Depression Ten''' was the tenth [[tropical cyclone]] of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It formed on August 13 from a [[tropical wave]] that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 8. As a result of strong [[wind shear]], the depression remained weak and did not strengthen beyond tropical depression status. The cyclone degenerated on August 14, although its remnants partially contributed to the formation of Tropical Depression Twelve, which eventually intensified into [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Capt. Julie Reports On Hurricane Katrina|date=June 5, 2007|publisher=''WPTV''|accessdate=2009-06-26|url=http://www.wptv.com/content/chopper5/story/Capt-Julie-Reports-On-Hurricane-Katrina/q__v8S2TZES2GiccRTQ2bw.cspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclone had no effect on land, and did not directly result in any fatalities or damage.

== Meteorological history ==
{{storm path|10-L 2005 track.png|alt=Track map of tropical depression}}
On August 8, a [[tropical wave]] emerged from the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking towards the west, the depression began to exhibit signs of [[Atmospheric convection|convective organization]] on August 11. The system continued to develop, and it is estimated that Tropical Depression Ten formed at 1200 UTC on August 13. At the time, it was located about {{convert|1600|mi|km}} east of [[Barbados]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt; Upon its designation, the depression consisted of a large area of thunderstorm activity, with curved [[tropical cyclone#Physical structure|banding features]] and expanding [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]]. However, the environmental conditions were predicted to quickly become unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number 1|date=August 13, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al102005.discus.001.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression moved erratically and slowly towards the west, and [[wind shear]] inhibited any significant intensification. Late on August 13, it was &quot;beginning to look like [[Hurricane Irene (2005)|Irene]]-junior as it undergoes southwesterly mid-level shear beneath the otherwise favorable upper-level outflow pattern&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;disc2&quot;/&gt; The wind shear was expected to relent within 48 hours, prompting some forecast models to suggest the depression would eventually attain hurricane status.&lt;ref name=&quot;disc2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stewart|title=Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number 2|date=August 13, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al102005.discus.002.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early August 14, the shear had substantially disrupted the storm, leaving the low-level [[atmospheric circulation|center of circulation]] exposed from the area of convection, which was also deteriorating. After meandering, the storm began to move westward. Forecasters expected it to resume a northwestward track as [[high pressure area|high pressure]] to the south of [[Bermuda]] was forecasted to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the [[Azores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knabb|title=Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number 3|date=August 14, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al102005.discus.003.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1800 UTC on August 14, the strong shear had further weakened the storm, and it no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant low, and the National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving westward, it occasionally produced bursts of convective activity, before dissipating on August 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt;

Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern [[Bahamas]] at 2100 UTC on August 23, partially from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=61|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-a8DRl1HuwoC&amp;q=%22tropical+depression+ten%22+2005&amp;dq=%22tropical+depression+ten%22+2005|author=United States Senate|title=Hurricane Katrina: a nation still unprepared|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=2006|isbn=0-16-076749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael P.

As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met. Tropical Depression Twelve later became [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

== Impact ==
Because Tropical Depression Ten never approached land as a [[tropical cyclone]], no [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings]] were issued for any land masses. No effects, damages, or fatalities were reported, and no ships reported tropical storm-force winds in association with the depression. The system did not attain tropical storm status; as such, it was not given a name by the [[National Hurricane Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|title=Tropical Depression Ten Tropical Cyclone Report|date=January 17, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL102005_Ten.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm partially contributed to the formation of Hurricane Katrina, which became a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] and made landfall in [[Louisiana]], causing catastrophic damage. Katrina was the costliest [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|hurricane]], and one of the five deadliest, in the history of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;&gt;

The '''criticism of the government response to Hurricane Katrina'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Katrinagate fury spreads to US media | publisher = Television New Zealand | date = 2005-09-07 | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425822/609550 | accessdate = 2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  consisted primarily of condemnations of mismanagement and lack of preparation in the relief effort in response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and its aftermath. Specifically, there was a delayed response to the flooding of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. (See [[Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans]] for criticism of the failure of Federal flood protection.)

Within days of Katrina's August 29, 2005 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the storm. Criticism was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained in New Orleans without water, food or [[Emergency shelter|shelter]], and the deaths of several citizens by thirst, exhaustion, and violence days after the storm itself had passed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The treatment of people who had evacuated to registered facilities such as the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] was also criticized.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits and journalists of all stripes has been directed at the local, state and federal governments.

New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] was also criticized for failing to implement his evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin is that he delayed his [[emergency evacuation]] order until less than a day before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;finalbipartisonreport&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/katrinareport/fullreport.pdf A Failure of Initiative. Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina].&quot; ''[[United States Government Printing Office]].'' February 17, 2006. Retrieved on July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the criticism was the broadcast of [[school bus]] parking lots full of yellow school buses which Mayor Nagin refused to be used in evacuation. When asked why the buses were not used to assist evacuations instead of holing up in the Superdome, Nagin cited the lack of insurance liability and shortage of bus drivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontline&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/storm/view/ Frontline: The Storm]&lt;/ref&gt;

New Orleans has been classified as a non-regime city. Regimes involve governmental and non-governmental cooperation, a specific agenda, a recognized problem and resources to deal with the problem. New Orleans only had a temporary coalition to deal with Hurricane Katrina, which led to ineffective, temporary and inefficient evacuation and provision of resources. Organizations such as the Red Cross attempted to form coalitions, but the various actors could not agree on a specific solution, and this failure to cooperate led to instability and misunderstanding between governmental and non-governmental actors.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, P.; Thomas, M.. &quot;The Failure of the Nonregime: How Katrina exposed New Orleans as a Regimeless City&quot;. Urban Affairs Review 41 (4): 517-527.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evacuation process criticism==
New Orleans was already one of the poorest metropolitan areas in the United States in 2005, with the eighth-lowest median income ($30,771). At 24.5 percent, Orleans Parish had the sixth-highest poverty rate among U.S. counties or county equivalents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOLApoverty&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Wolf|title=New Orleans symbolizes U.S. war on poverty|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-12-21-new-orleans-poverty_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|date=2006-12-21|accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States 2000 Census|The 2000 U.S. census]] revealed that 27% of New Orleans households, amounting to approximately 120,000&amp;nbsp;people, were without private mobility. Despite these factors preventing many people from being able to evacuate on their own, the mandatory evacuation called on August 28 made no provisions to evacuate homeless, low-income, or carless individuals or sick, nor the city's elderly or infirm residents. Consequentially most of those stranded in the city were the poor, the elderly, and the sick.

It has been stated in the evacuation order that, beginning at noon on August 28 and running for several hours, all city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents to, &quot;refuges of last resort,&quot; designated in advance, including the [[Louisiana Superdome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOdanger&quot;&gt;Davis, Matthew. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4331330.stm Fema 'knew of New Orleans danger'].&quot; ''[[BBC News]].'' October 11, 2005. Retrieved on July 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that the state had prepositioned enough food and water to supply 15,000 citizens with supplies for three days, the anticipated waiting period before FEMA would arrive in force and provide supplies for those still in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOdanger&quot;/&gt; Later, it was found that FEMA had provided these supplies, but that FEMA Director [[Michael D. Brown]] was greatly surprised by the much larger numbers of people who turned up seeking refuge and that the first wave of supplies were quickly depleted.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOdanger&quot;/&gt; The large numbers were a direct result of the insufficient mobilization and evacuation before Katrina's arrival, primarily due to city and state resistance to issuing an evacuation order and risk &quot;crying wolf&quot; and losing face should the hurricane had left the path of model prediction. Had contra-flow on highways been initiated sooner and more buses begun evacuating families (including the idle school buses that were not used at all) the numbers of stranded New Orleans occupants would have been significantly less making the initial wave of FEMA supplies adequate and even excessive.

==Federal government response==
President Bush signed a [[United States Dollar|$]]10.5&amp;nbsp;billion relief package within four days of the hurricane,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/02/katrina.congress/index.html Bush signs $10.5 billion disaster aid bill].&quot; ''[[CNN]].''

&lt;/ref&gt; There was also concern that many National Guard units were short staffed in surrounding states because some units were deployed overseas and local recruiting efforts in schools and the community had been hampered making reserves less than ideal.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatlGuardinIraq&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, Juan. &quot;[http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0901-25.htm Iraq Mess Adds to the Problem].&quot; ''[[New York Daily News]].'' September 1, 2005. Retrieved on July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the slow response to the hurricane, New Orleans's top emergency management official called the effort a &quot;national disgrace&quot; and questioned when reinforcements would actually reach the increasingly desperate city.&lt;ref name=&quot;natldisgrace&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.palmbeachpost.com/storm/content/storm/2005/atlantic/katrina/day_by_day_archive.html Katrina day-by-day recap].&quot; ''[[Palm Beach Post]].'' September 1, 2005. Retrieved on July 15, 2006.{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Orleans's emergency operations chief Terry Ebbert blamed the inadequate response on the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA). &quot;This is not a FEMA operation. I haven't seen a single FEMA guy&quot;, he said. &quot;FEMA has been here three days, yet there is no command and control. We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims, but we can't bail out the city of New Orleans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;natldisgrace&quot;/&gt;

In the early morning of September 2 mayor [[Ray Nagin]] expressed his frustration at what he claimed were insufficient reinforcements provided by the President and federal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.wwl.com/Article.asp?id=114098&amp;spid=5460 WWL Interview with an Upset New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin].&quot; (audio) ''[[WWL (AM)]].''

However, many police, fire and EMS organizations from outside the affected areas were reportedly hindered or otherwise slowed in their efforts to send help and assistance to the area.

On the morning of August 28, the president telephoned Mayor Nagin to &quot;plead&quot; for a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, and Nagin and Gov.

[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] was also criticized in his role in the aftermath. On the night of August 30, and again the next morning, he personally called the manager of the Southern Pines Electric Power Association and ordered him to divert power crews to [[electrical substation]]s in nearby [[Collins, Mississippi]] that were essential to the operation of the [[Colonial Pipeline]], which carries gasoline and [[diesel fuel]] from [[Texas]] to the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].&lt;ref&gt;Maute, Nikki D. &quot;[http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050911/NEWS05/509110304 Power crews diverted].&quot; ''Hattiesburg American.''

In January 2006, the President gave his 2006 State of the Union Address:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one another...

A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency -- and stays at it until they're back on their feet. So far the federal government has committed $85 billion to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We're removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived.

In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and more opportunities to own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2007, the fired FEMA director [[Michael D. Brown]] charged that partisan politics had played a role in the White House's decision to [[federalize]] emergency response to the disaster in Louisiana only rather than along the entire affected Gulf Coast region, which Brown said he had advocated. &quot;Unbeknownst to me, certain people in the White House were thinking, 'We had to federalize Louisiana because she's a white, female Democratic governor, and we have a chance to rub her nose in it,'&quot; Brown said, speaking before a group of graduate students at the Metropolitan College of New York on January 19, 2007. &quot;'We can't do it to Haley [Mississippi governor [[Haley Barbour]]] because Haley's a white male Republican governor. And we can't do a thing to him. So we're just gonna federalize Louisiana.'&quot; The White House fervently denied Brown's charges through a spokeswoman and Brown's comments have never been substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;Toosi, Nahal. &quot;[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2007/01/23/76108.htm Brown: Politics played role in Katrina.]&quot; [[The Associated Press]] via the ''Insurance Journal'', Jan. 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion of the recovery efforts for Hurricane Katrina took a back seat to terrorism and Iraq in his [[2006 State of the Union Address]].  In that speech, Bush did not mention any human suffering caused by the storm or its aftermath, and did not acknowledge any shortcomings in his administration's response.  Some media sources criticized Bush for failing to mention hurricane recovery in his [[2007 State of the Union Address]].&lt;ref&gt;Peeples, Melanie. &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7004942 Bush's State of the Union Omits State of Louisiana]&quot;, ''[[NPR]]'', January 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor would they explain why Bush felt the need to appoint a separate task force.

Chertoff's hesitation and Bush's creation of a task force both appear to contradict the National Response Plan and previous presidential directives that specify what the secretary of homeland security is assigned to do without further presidential orders. The goal of the National Response Plan is to provide a streamlined framework for swiftly delivering federal assistance when a disaster – caused by terrorists or Mother Nature – is too big for local officials to handle.&lt;ref name=&quot;chertoffmemo&quot;/&gt;}}

FEMA was accused of deliberately slowing things down, in an effort to ensure that all assistance and relief workers were coordinated properly. For example, [[Michael D.

===Louisiana===
Chief among those criticisms is that state National Guard troops, under the command of Governor Blanco, were responsible for quelling civil unrest in advance of humanitarian relief efforts, yet they failed to do so in the first few days after the hurricane.

Notably, federal troops are generally prohibited from directly enforcing state laws (e.g., controlling looting or riots) by the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], with [[Posse Comitatus Act#Limits on the Act|some exceptions]]. The President can assume command of state troops under the [[Stafford Act]], but in this &quot;federalized&quot;, or &quot;[[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]]&quot; status, the federalized National Guard troops become unable to enforce laws directly, just like other federal troops. However, the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to National Guard troops under the command of a state governor.

Shortly before midnight on Friday, September 2, the Bush administration sent Governor Blanco a request to take over command of law enforcement under the [[Insurrection Act]] (one of the exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act), but this request was rejected by Blanco.&lt;ref&gt;Roig-Franzia, Manuel; Hsu, Spencer. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090301680_pf.html Many Evacuated, but Thousands Still Waiting].&quot; ''[[Washington Post]].'' September 4, 2005. Retrieved on July 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Haley Barbour]] of [[Mississippi]] also rejected a similar request.

Governor Blanco did make a request to the Federal government for additional National Guard troops (to be under her command) to supplement the 5,700 Louisiana National Guard troops available in Louisiana at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Shane, Scott; Shanker, Thom. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/28/national/nationalspecial/28guard.html?ei=5090&amp;en=1218fd35c0af7127&amp;ex=1285560000&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print When Storm Hit, National Guard Was Deluged Too].&quot; ''[[New York Times]].''

Within the United States and as delineated in the [[National Response Plan]], response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrp&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=National Response Plan|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xprepresp/committees/editorial_0566.shtm|accessdate=2007-11-01|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels. One example of this is that the City of New Orleans attempted to manage the disaster from a hotel ballroom with inadequate back-up communications plans instead of a properly staffed [[Emergency Operations Center]].&lt;ref&gt;''World Psychiatry'': [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472255/ The Katrina disaster and its lessons], Lynn E.

Press reports indicate that there were other failures at the state and local level in expediting aid and social services to the stricken area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Referring again to the federalisation of the National Guard, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin accused the governor of delaying federal rescue efforts, &quot;I was ready to move today.

Blanco failed to submit a request for help in a timely manner, saying that she did send President Bush a request asking for shelter and provisions, but didn't specifically ask for help with evacuations. The nonpartisan [[Congressional Research Service]] has concluded, that Blanco did submit requests for shelter, counseling and provisions in a timely manner, but there is no mention that she requested assistance with evacuation. One aide to the governor said that Blanco thought city officials were taking care of the evacuation in accord with the city's emergency plan.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer.&quot;[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=1102467&amp;page=1&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Who's to Blame for Delayed Response to Katrina?]&quot; ''[[ABC News]].''

===City and local response===
[[File:Bus yard-rotate.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of flooded New Orleans [[school bus]]es.]]
Many have also criticized the local and state governments, who have primary responsibility for local disasters, including both Governor Blanco and Mayor Nagin. Mayor Nagin was criticized for allegedly failing to execute the New Orleans disaster plan, which called for the use of the city's school buses in evacuating residents unable to leave on their own. The city never deployed the buses, which were subsequently destroyed in the flooding.

On Saturday August 27, several hours after the last regularly scheduled train left New Orleans, [[Amtrak]] ran a special train to move equipment out of the city. The train had room for several hundred passengers, and Amtrak offered these spaces to the city, but the city declined them, so the train left New Orleans at 8:30 p.m., with no passengers on board.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaos&quot;&gt;Glasser, Susan B.; Grunwald, Michael. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/10/AR2005091001529_4.html The Steady Buildup to a City's Chaos].&quot; ''[[Washington Post]].''

The convention center conditions were described as appalling, having become surrounded by refuse, human feces and even corpses.

====Confiscation of civilian firearms====
Controversy arose over a September 8 city-wide order by New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass to local police, U.S. Army National Guard soldiers, and Deputy U.S. Marshals to confiscate all civilian-held [[firearms]]. &quot;No one will be able to be armed,&quot; Compass said. &quot;Guns will be taken. Only law enforcement will be allowed to have guns.&quot; Seizures were carried out without warrant, and in some cases with excessive force; one instance captured on film involved 58&amp;nbsp;year old New Orleans resident Patricia Konie. Konie stayed behind, in her well provisioned home, and had an old [[revolver]] for protection. A group of police entered the house, and when she refused to surrender her revolver, she was tackled and it was removed by force. Konie's shoulder was fractured, and she was taken into police custody for failing to surrender her firearm.&lt;ref name=hallbrook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.gmu.edu/gmucrlj/docs/halbrook.doc|title=Only law enforcement will be allowed to have guns: Hurricance Katrina and the New Orleans firearm confiscations |author=Stephen P.

Angered citizens, backed by the [[National Rifle Association]] and other organizations, filed protests over the constitutionality of such an order and the difficulty in tracking seizures, as paperwork was rarely filed during the searches. [[Wayne LaPierre]], CEO of the National Rifle Association, defended the right of affected citizens to retain firearms, saying that, &quot;What we’ve seen in Louisiana - the breakdown of law and order in the aftermath of disaster - is exactly the kind of situation where the Second Amendment was intended to allow citizens to protect themselves.&quot; The searches received little news coverage, though reaction from groups such as the NRA, the Second Amendment Foundation, and [[Gun Owners of America]] was immediate and heated, and a lawsuit was filed September 22 by the NRA and SAF on behalf of two firearm owners whose firearms were seized. On September 23, the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] issued a [[restraining order]] to bar further firearms confiscations.&lt;ref name=hallbrook /&gt;

After refusing to admit that it had any seized firearms, the city revealed in mid-March that it did have a cache of some 1000 firearms seized after the hurricane; this disclosure came after the NRA filed a motion in court to hold the city in [[contempt]] for failure to comply with the U.S. District Court's earlier order to return all seized firearms. On April 14, 2006, it was announced that the city will begin to return seized firearms, however as of early 2008, many firearms were still in police possession, and the matter was still in court.&lt;ref name=hallbrook /&gt;  The matter was finally settled in favor of the NRA in October 2008.  Per the agreement, the city was required to relax the strict proof of ownership requirements previously used, and was to release firearms to their owners with an [[affidavit]] claiming ownership and a [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|background check]] to verify that the owner is legally able to possess a firearm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/10/09/nra_to_settle_suit_over_katrina_gun_seizures/ |title=NRA to settle suit over Katrina gun seizures |author=Michael Kunzelman |publisher=Associated Press |date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisiana legislator [[Steve Scalise]] introduced Louisiana House Bill 760, which would prohibit confiscation of firearms in a state of emergency, unless the seizure is pursuant to the investigation of a crime, or if the seizure is necessary to prevent immediate harm to the officer or another individual. On June 8, 2006, HB 760 was signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laleglog.blogspot.com/2006_04_01_archive.html|title=Louisiana Legislature Log}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 other states joined Louisiana in enacting similar laws. A federal law prohibiting seizure of lawfully held firearms during an emergency, the [[Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006]], passed in the House with a vote of 322 to 99, and in the Senate by 84-16. The bill was signed into law by President Bush on October 9, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nraila.org/Issues/FactSheets/Read.aspx?ID=191|title=State &quot;Emergency Powers&quot; vs. The Right to Arms|author=NRA-ILA}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate [[International response to Hurricane Katrina|response from many nations]] was to ask to be allowed to send in self-sustaining [[search and rescue]] teams to assist in evacuating those remaining in the city. This first to respond was Venezuela, offering tons of food, water, and a million barrels of extra petroleum. [[French response to Hurricane Katrina|France]] had a range of aircraft, two naval ships and a hospital ship standing ready in the [[Caribbean]].

==House of Representatives report==
The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] created the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina. On February 15, 2006 they released their final report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katrina.house.gov/full_katrina_report.htm Final Report: U.S. House of Representatives Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina], 2006-2-15, Retrieved 2007-6-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Executive Summary states (among other things) the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/katrinareport/execsummary.pdf Executive Summary, Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina], 2006-2-15, [http://gpoaccess.gov U.S. Government Printing Office], Retrieved 2007-6-11&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;The Select Committee identified failures at all levels of government that significantly undermined and detracted from the heroic efforts of ﬁrst responders, private individuals and organizations, faith-based groups, and others.&quot;
*&quot;The Select Committee believes Katrina was primarily a failure of initiative.&quot;
*&quot;The failure of local, state, and federal governments to respond more effectively to Katrina — which had been predicted in theory for many years, and forecast with startling accuracy for ﬁve days — demonstrates that whatever improvements have been made to our capacity to respond to natural or man-made disasters, four and half years after 9/11, we are still not fully prepared. Local ﬁrst responders were largely overwhelmed and unable to perform their duties, and the [[National Response Plan]] did not adequately provide a way for federal assets to quickly supplement or, if necessary, supplant ﬁrst responders.&quot;

==Social issues==

===Vulnerability of the poorest residents===
[[African-American]] leaders and others have expressed outrage at what they see as the apparent neglect of the poor and/or black residents of the affected region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chron 9-23-05&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Sandalow | first = Marc | title = Katrina thrusts race and poverty onto national stage: Bush and Congress under pressure to act | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | date= 2005-09-23 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/09/23/MNG64ESMPQ1.DTL | accessdate = 2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of the residents of New Orleans are black, primarily attributed to decades of [[white flight]]. In addition, New Orleans is one of America's poorest cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chron 9-23-05&quot;/&gt; with more than 25% of residents and 40% of children living at or below the [[poverty line]]. Within the city itself, the poorest, who are mostly African-American, tended to live in the lowest parts that are most vulnerable to flooding.

98% of residents in the [[9th Ward|Lower Ninth Ward]], which was flooded by a catastrophic breach in the nearby Industrial Canal, are black, and more than a third live in poverty. Many of the poor depend on [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], or other public assistance checks, which they receive on the first of each month, meaning that Hurricane Katrina made landfall just when many of the poor had exhausted their resources. Thus, many of the city's poor simply couldn't afford to flee the city before the hurricane struck.

Speaking at a press conference from a relief center in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]] explained that the poor are always the main victims of natural disasters. &quot;This is what happens when there's a natural disaster of this scope,&quot; Mrs. Bush said. &quot;The poorer people are usually in the neighborhoods that are the lowest or the most exposed or the most vulnerable. Their housing is the most vulnerable to natural disaster. And that is just always what happens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The first lady: That's just the way it is |author=Tim Grieve |newspaper=[[Salon.com]] |date=September 2, 2005 |url=http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2005/09/02/laurabush/index.html |accessdate=July 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] criticized the President and asked why he has not named African-Americans to top positions in the federal response to the disaster, particularly when the majority of victims remaining stranded in New Orleans were black: &quot;How can blacks be locked out of the leadership, and trapped in the suffering? It is that lack of sensitivity and compassion that represents a kind of incompetence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JesseJackson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Simpson|first=Doug|title=Jesse Jackson lashes out at Bush over Katrina response|url=http://www.wwltv.com/local/stories/wwl090205jackson.1c68e297.html|work=WWLTV.com|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20080327035254/http://www.wwltv.com/local/stories/wwl090205jackson.1c68e297.html|archivedate=March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty-one percent of Louisiana residents who were killed by Hurricane Katrina were black; 49% of victims were 75 years old or older. However, for some demographic groups in Orleans Parish (New Orleans), the death rate for African-Americans was 1.7-4 times higher than for whites; as a whole in Orleans parish, 68% of deaths (459 out of 680 total) were black people, almost exactly the same percentage of the population there as that found in the 2000 U.S. Census (which recorded 67%).&lt;ref&gt;Brunkard, Joan, Gonza Namulanda and Roult Ratard. 2008. Hurricane Katrina Deaths, Louisiana, 2005.  Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, 1,1:1-9. p. 1, Table 2&lt;/ref&gt;
Areas of the city where the largest number of dead were found were low-lying, flood-prone areas with predominantly black populations.&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, Patrick. 2005. Survival and Death in New Orleans: An Empirical Look at the Human Impact of Katrina. Journal of Black Studies, 37, 4:482-501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race as a factor in the slow response===
Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] claimed that [[racism]] was a factor in the slow government response, stating that &quot;many black people feel that their race, their property conditions and their voting patterns have been a factor in the response.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/04/sunday/main814720.shtml|title=What If They Were White?|last=Giles|first=Nancy|date=2005-10-04|work=CBS News Sunday Morning|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentator [[Lou Dobbs]] of [[CNN]] has claimed that local officials should bear some responsibility, saying that &quot;the city of New Orleans is 70% black, its mayor is black, its principal power structure is black, and if there is a failure to the black Americans, who live in poverty and in the city of New Orleans, those officials have to bear much of the responsibility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/02/ldt.01.html Lou Dobbs Tonight (transcript)].&quot; ''[[CNN]].''

Former [[List of mayors of Atlanta|Mayor of]] [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|UN Ambassador]] [[Andrew Young]], who was born in New Orleans, had a more nuanced reaction to the disaster: &quot;I was surprised and not surprised. It's not just a lack of preparedness. I think the easy answer is to say that these are poor people and black people and so the government doesn't give a damn... there might be some truth to that. But I think we've got to see this as a serious problem of the long-term neglect of an environmental system on which our nation depends.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Purdum, Todd S. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/03/national/nationalspecial/03voices.html?ex=1283400000&amp;en=aa8fe67000016b3d&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss Across U.S., Outrage at Response].&quot; ''[[New York Times]].''

On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief on NBC, ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', rapper [[Kanye West]] was a featured speaker. Controversy arose when West was presenting, as he deviated from the prepared script, [[A Concert for Hurricane Relief#Kanye_West|criticizing the slow federal response]]. Actor [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he said &quot;[[George W. Bush|George Bush]] doesn't care about black people.&quot; At this point, telethon producer [[Rick Kaplan]] cut off the microphone and then cut away to [[Chris Tucker]], who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds. Still, West's comment reached much of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=44415a2b-7481-45f8-91a3-630b0b5510de&amp;entry=index|title=NBC KO's Kanye's Bush Bashing|last=Byrne|first=Bridget|work=E!

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization of displaced persons as &quot;refugees&quot;===
Many media agencies in the U.S. and around the world were criticized for using the word &quot;[[refugee]]&quot; to describe someone that was [[displaced person|displaced]] by Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name=&quot;refugees&quot;&gt;Noveck, Jocelyn. &quot;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002477023_katword07.html The use of word &quot;refugee&quot; touches a nerve].&quot; ''[[Seattle Times]].'' September 7, 2005. Retrieved on July 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many, particularly African-Americans, have argued that using the term &quot;refugee&quot; implies a sort of &quot;second class&quot; status, while others have argued that using terms such as &quot;evacuees&quot; or &quot;displaced&quot; is too clinical and not dramatic enough to portray the current situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;refugees&quot;/&gt; President Bush addressed this issue in the following statement: &quot;The people we're talking about are not refugees. They are Americans and they need the help and love and compassion of our fellow citizens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;refugees&quot;/&gt; Accordingly, most of the major media outlets in the U.S. eliminated the usage of &quot;refugees&quot;, with a few exceptions.

==Potential discrimination against non-U.S. citizens==
There was some criticism by tourists that rescue crews were giving preferential treatment to American citizens first. For example, some British tourists trapped in a New Orleans hotel accused the authorities of preferential treatment for Americans during the evacuation as Katrina approached.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Mark. &quot;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1562517,00.html You're on your own, Britain's victims told].&quot; ''[[The Guardian]].'' September 4, 2005. Retrieved on July 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian tourists reported a similar experience, compounded by the federal government's refusal to admit consular officers to the New Orleans area and failure to notify the Australian embassy that one missing tourist was in a correctional facility on minor charges.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, Leigh. &quot;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2005/s1455687.htm Missing Australian found in New Orleans prison].&quot; ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].'' September 8, 2005.Retrieved on July 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; South African tourists also reported that tourist buses were commandeered by federal officials, and the tourists told to walk back. Later on, they were driven back by warning shots after waiting near a bridge blocked by armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;DURBAN&quot;&gt;Gounden, Fiona. &quot;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20050903090112777C628125 Durban girls trapped in Katrina nightmare].&quot; ''The Independent Online.'' September 3, 2005. Retrieved on July 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days before the storm, Mayor Nagin was particularly blunt in regards to foreign tourists, stating, &quot;The only thing I can say to them is I hope they have a hotel room, and it's a least on the third floor and up. Unfortunately, unless they can rent a car to get out of town, which I doubt they can at this point, they're probably in the position of riding the storm out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chaos&quot;/&gt; Hotel managers also criticised the treatment of tourists, with one noting they were treated worse than the people in the Superdome.&lt;ref name=&quot;DURBAN&quot;/&gt;

However, there were also some reports that portrayed the overall generosity of the American people. Some Irish tourists were touched by the &quot;infinite kindness&quot; shown to them by &quot;complete strangers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4214952.stm Hurricane survivors describe mayhem].&quot; September 5, 2005.

'''Hurricane Katrina''' was the deadliest and most destructive [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]]&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE--&gt; of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]].

Among recorded [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]]s, it was the [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|sixth strongest overall]]. At least 1,833&amp;nbsp;people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]]; total property damage was estimated at $81&amp;nbsp;billion (2005 USD),&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Knabb|first=Richard D|coauthors=Rhome, Jamie R.; Brown, Daniel P|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Katrina: 23–30&amp;nbsp;August 2005|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|date=December 20, 2005; updated August 10, 2006|accessdate=2006-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly triple the damage brought by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;andrewtcr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1992andrew.html|title=Preliminary Report for Hurricane Andrew|accessdate=2008-04-10|last=Rappaport|first=Ed|publisher= National Hurricane Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane Katrina formed over [[the Bahamas]] on August 23, 2005 and crossed southern [[Florida]] as a moderate [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 1|Category&amp;nbsp;1 hurricane]], causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The hurricane strengthened to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 5|Category&amp;nbsp;5]] hurricane over the warm Gulf water, but weakened before making its second landfall as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 3|Category&amp;nbsp;3]] hurricane on the morning of Monday, August 29 in southeast Louisiana. It caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas, much of it due to the [[storm surge]]. The most significant [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|number of deaths]] occurred in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], which flooded as the [[levee]] system [[Catastrophic failure|catastrophically failed]], in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland.&lt;ref name=&quot;TPInteractive&quot; /&gt; Eventually 80% of the city and large tracts of neighboring [[list of parishes of Louisiana|parishes]] became flooded, and the floodwaters lingered for weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;TPInteractive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=Dan D|coauthors=Marshall, Bob |url=http://www.nola.com/katrina/graphics/credits.swf|format=SWF|title=Flash Flood: Hurricane Katrina's Inundation of New Orleans, August&amp;nbsp;29, 2005|publisher=[[Times-Picayune]]|date=May 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the worst property damage occurred in coastal areas, such as all [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Mississippi|Mississippi beachfront towns]], which were flooded over 90% in hours, as boats and casino barges rammed buildings, pushing cars and houses inland, with waters reaching 6–12&amp;nbsp;miles (10–19&amp;nbsp;km) from the beach.

There was also an investigation of the responses from federal, state and local governments, resulting in the resignation of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) director [[Michael D. Brown]], and of [[New Orleans Police Department]] (NOPD) Superintendent [[Eddie Compass]].

Several agencies including the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC), and [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) were commended for their actions. They provided accurate hurricane weather tracking forecasts with sufficient lead time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongressInvestigation&quot;/&gt; Even the most insistent appeals from national, state and local public officials to residents to evacuate before the storm did not warn that the levees could breach and fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sandy-rosenthal/katrina-levees-warning_b_1001777.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Sandy | last=Rosenthal | title=Insistent Appeals to Evacuate Did Not Warn That the Levees Could Break | date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological history==
{{Main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina}}
{{storm path|Katrina 2005 track.png}}
Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005 as the result of an interaction of a [[tropical wave]] and the remains of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]]. The system was upgraded to [[Tropical low|tropical storm status]] on the morning of August 24 and at this point, the storm was given the name ''Katrina.'' The tropical storm continued to move towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]] on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot; /&gt;

The storm [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] after entering the Gulf, growing from a Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane to a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane in just nine hours. This rapid growth was due to the storm's movement over the &quot;unusually warm&quot; [[sea surface temperature|waters]] of the [[Loop Current]], which increased wind speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leben, Robert; Born, George; Scott, Jim|url=http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html|title=CU-Boulder Researchers Chart Katrina's Growth In Gulf Of Mexico|publisher=''[[University of Colorado at Boulder]]''|date=September 15, 2005|accessdate=2011-05-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090301014255/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html|archivedate=March 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday, August 27, the storm reached Category&amp;nbsp;3 intensity on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], becoming the third [[Tropical cyclone scales#Atlantic and East Pacific|major hurricane]] of the season. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Katrina again rapidly intensified, attaining Category&amp;nbsp;5 status on the morning of August 28 and reached its peak strength at 1800 UTC that day, with maximum sustained winds of 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h) and a minimum central [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of {{convert|902|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] at the time. However, this record was later broken by Hurricane Rita.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

Katrina made its second landfall at 1110 UTC (6:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. CDT) on Monday, August 29 as a Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]]. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120&amp;nbsp;miles (190&amp;nbsp;km) from the center and the storm's central pressure was {{convert|920|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and [[Breton Sound]], it made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h) sustained winds, still at Category&amp;nbsp;3 intensity. Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150&amp;nbsp;miles (240&amp;nbsp;km) inland near [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern [[Great Lakes]] region on August 31, when it was absorbed by a [[Surface weather analysis#Cold front|frontal boundary]]. The resulting [[extratropical]] storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

On August 26, the state of Mississippi activated its [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] in preparation for the storm's landfall. Additionally, the state government activated its Emergency Operations Center the next day, and local governments began issuing evacuation orders. By 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]] on August 28, 11 counties and eleven cities issued evacuation orders, a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities by the following morning.

By August 26, the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered. Many of the computer models had shifted the potential path of Katrina {{convert|150|mi|km|-1}} westward from the Florida Panhandle, putting the city of New Orleans directly in the center of their track probabilities; the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17%, with strike probability rising to 29% by August 28.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/prb/al122005.prblty.015.shtml Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 15],&quot; and &quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/prb/al122005.prblty.021.shtml Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 21].&quot; ''National Hurricane Center.''

Many people living in the South Florida area were unaware when Katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane in one day and struck southern Florida near the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] county line. The hurricane struck between the cities of [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]], in Miami-Dade County, and [[Hallandale, Florida|Hallandale]], in Broward County, on Thursday, August 25, 2005. However, National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts had correctly predicted that Katrina would intensify to hurricane strength before landfall, and [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watches and warnings]] were issued 31.5&amp;nbsp;hours and 19.5&amp;nbsp;hours before landfall, respectively&amp;nbsp;— only slightly less than the target thresholds of 36 and 24&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in Florida}}
Hurricane Katrina first made landfall on August 25, 2005 in [[South Florida]] where it hit as a Category&amp;nbsp;1 hurricane, with 80&amp;nbsp;mph (130&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds. Rainfall was heavy in places and exceeded 14&amp;nbsp;inches (350&amp;nbsp;mm) in [[Homestead, Florida]],&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; and a storm surge of 3&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|5|ft|m}} was measured in parts of [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;katreport&quot;/&gt; More than 1&amp;nbsp;million customers were left without [[electricity]], and damage in Florida was estimated from $1&amp;nbsp;– $2&amp;nbsp;billion, with most of the damage coming from flooding and overturned trees. There were 14 fatalities reported in Florida as a result of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

Most of the [[Florida Keys]] experienced tropical-storm force winds from Katrina as the storm's center passed to the north, with hurricane force winds reported in the [[Dry Tortugas]]. Rainfall was also high in the islands, with 10&amp;nbsp;inches (250&amp;nbsp;mm) falling on [[Key West, Florida|Key West]]. On August 26, a strong [[Fujita scale|F1]] [[tornado]] formed from an outer rain band of Katrina and struck [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]]. The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marathon Tornado&quot;&gt;Devenas, Andy &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060624012057/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/Marathon_Report.pdf Marathon Tornado Survey Report].&quot; ''[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office [[Key West, Florida]]'' Retrieved on 2006-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hurricane Katrina stayed well to the north of [[Cuba]], on August 29 it brought tropical-storm force winds and rainfall of over 8&amp;nbsp;inches (200&amp;nbsp;mm) to western regions of the island. Telephone and power lines were damaged and around 8,000&amp;nbsp;people were evacuated in the [[Pinar del Río Province]]. According to Cuban television reports the coastal city of Surgidero de Batabano was 90% underwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuba damage&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2005/08/29/batters.shtml Hurricane Katrina batters western Cuba]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana===
[[File:PostVeniceLG.jpg|thumb|Flooding in [[Venice, Louisiana]]]]
On August 29, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]] with 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds, as a strong Category&amp;nbsp;3 storm. However, as it had only just weakened from Category&amp;nbsp;4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large, it is possible that sustained winds of Category&amp;nbsp;4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern Louisiana. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a very significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in [[Plaquemines Parish]] indicated a storm tide in excess of 14&amp;nbsp;feet (4.3&amp;nbsp;m) and a 12-foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge was recorded in [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]]. Hurricane Katrina made final landfall near the mouth of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]], with the eye straddling [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana]] and Hancock County, Mississippi, on the morning of August 29 at about 9:45M CST.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

Hurricane Katrina also brought heavy rain to Louisiana, with 8&amp;nbsp;– 10&amp;nbsp;inches (200&amp;nbsp;– 250&amp;nbsp;mm) falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state. In the area around [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], the rainfall was even higher, and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15&amp;nbsp;inches (380&amp;nbsp;mm). As a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of [[Lake Pontchartrain]] rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore, affecting communities from Slidell to [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]]. Several bridges were destroyed, including the [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge]] connecting Slidell to New Orleans.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; Almost 900,000&amp;nbsp;people in Louisiana lost power as a result of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power failures&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/docs/katrina/katrina_083005_1600.pdf Hurricane Katrina Situation Report#11].&quot; ''Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) [[United States Department of Energy]].''

Katrina’s storm surge inundated all parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain, including [[St. Tammany]], Tangipahoa, [[St. John the Baptist]] and [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles]] Parishes. St. Tammany Parish received a two-part storm surge.  The first surge came as Lake Pontchartrain rose and the storm blew water from the Gulf of Mexico into the lake. The second came as the eye of Katrina passed, westerly winds pushed water into a bottleneck at the Rigolets Pass, forcing it farther inland. The range of surge levels in eastern St. Tammany Parish is estimated at 13 to {{convert|16|ft|m}}, not including wave action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/katrina_la_overview-n.pdf |title=FEMA: Louisiana Katrina Surge Inundation Map, January 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard-hit [[St. Bernard Parish]] was flooded due to breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO) and the breach of the Levee Board designed and built 40 Arpent canal levee. The search for the missing was undertaken by the St. Bernard Fire Department due to the assets of the [[United States Coast Guard]] being diverted to New Orleans. In the months after the storm, many of the missing were tracked down by searching flooded homes, tracking credit card records, and visiting homes of family and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Cannizaro, Steve. &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060827225149/http://www.sbpg.net/cannizaro121705a.html List of Missing Residents Down to 47, and More...]&quot; ''St. Bernard Parish Government (press release).''

As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. From this the NHC concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of Category&amp;nbsp;1 or Category&amp;nbsp;2 strength.

Katrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federally built levee system]] protecting metro New Orleans and the failure of the 40 Arpent Canal levee. Nearly every levee in metro New Orleans was breached as Hurricane Katrina passed just east of the city limits. Failures occurred in New Orleans and surrounding communities, especially St. Bernard Parish. The [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] (MR-GO) breached its levees in approximately 20 places, flooding much of east New Orleans, most of [[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard Parish]] and the East Bank of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]]. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the [[17th Street Canal]] levee, the [[London Avenue Canal]], and the wide, navigable [[Industrial Canal]], which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Verity. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4307972.stm Fixing New Orleans' thin grey line].&quot; ''[[BBC News]].''

Katrina traveled up the entire state, and afterwards, all 82 counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance, 47 for full assistance.&lt;ref name=HBrecov/&gt;

After making a brief initial landfall in Louisiana, Katrina had made its final landfall near the state line, and the eyewall passed over the cities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland as a Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; Katrina's powerful right-front quadrant passed over the west and central Mississippi coast, causing a powerful 27-foot (8.2&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge, which penetrated 6&amp;nbsp;miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) inland in many areas and up to 12&amp;nbsp;miles (20&amp;nbsp;km) inland along bays and rivers; in some areas, the surge crossed [[Interstate 10]] for several miles.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; Hurricane Katrina brought strong winds to Mississippi, which caused significant tree damage throughout the state.

Katrina caused eleven tornadoes in Mississippi on August 29, some of which damaged trees and power lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt;

Battered by wind, rain and storm surge, some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled.

In Harrison County, [[Pass Christian]] was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as D'Iberville, which borders Back Bay. [[Biloxi]], on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area. In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river [[estuary]], with the combined surge and freshwater flooding cutting the county in half. Remarkably, over 90% of Pascagoula, the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, and about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} east of Katrina's landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, was flooded from surge at the height of the storm. Other large Jackson County neighborhoods such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Hills were severely damaged with large portions being completely destroyed, and [[St. Martin, Mississippi|St. Martin]] was hard hit; Ocean Springs, [[Moss Point, Mississippi|Moss Point]], Gautier, and [[Escatawpa]] also suffered major surge damage.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials also recorded deaths in [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest]], [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds]], [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren]], and [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake]] counties. Over 900,000&amp;nbsp;people throughout the state experienced power outages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power failures&quot;/&gt;

Although Hurricane Katrina made landfall well to the west, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were both affected by tropical-storm force winds and a storm surge varying from 12 to 16&amp;nbsp;feet (3–5&amp;nbsp;m) around [[Mobile Bay]],&lt;ref name=KatrinaTCR/&gt; with higher waves on top. Sustained winds of 67&amp;nbsp;mph (107&amp;nbsp;km/h) were recorded in [[Mobile, Alabama]], and the storm surge there was approximately 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.7&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay. Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama.&lt;ref name=KatrinaTCR/&gt; Ships, oil rigs, boats and fishing [[pier]]s were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V ''Caribbean Clipper'' and many fishing boats were grounded at [[Bayou La Batre]].

An [[Oil platform|oil rig]] under construction along the [[Mobile River]] broke its moorings and floated 1.5&amp;nbsp;miles (2&amp;nbsp;km) northwards before striking the Cochrane Bridge just outside Mobile. No significant damage resulted to the bridge and it was soon reopened. The damage on [[Dauphin Island]] was severe, with the surge destroying many houses and cutting a new canal through the western portion of the island. An offshore oil rig also became grounded on the island. As in Mississippi, the storm surge caused significant beach erosion along the Alabama coastline.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;/&gt; More than 600,000&amp;nbsp;people lost power in Alabama as a result of Hurricane Katrina and two people died in a traffic accident in the state. Residents in some areas, such as Selma, were without power for several days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power failures&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Katrina Bayou La Batre 2005 boats ashore.jpg|thumb|[[Bayou La Batre]]: cargo ship and fishing boats were grounded]]

Within the United States and as delineated in the [[National Response Plan]], disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgovwh&quot;/&gt;

Some [[disaster recovery]] response to Katrina began before the storm, with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a [[mortuary]] team with refrigerated trucks. A network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from New Orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall (even though many were directed to not enter the area), and continued for more than six months after the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgovwh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Government|title=The FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE KATRINA: LESSONS LEARNED|year=2006|publisher=|accessdate=2008-06-06|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/reports/katrina-lessons-learned.pdf|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA provided housing assistance (rental assistance, [[FEMA Trailer|trailers]], etc.) to more than 700,000 applicants—families and individuals.

Law enforcement and public safety agencies, from across the United States, provided a &quot;[[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]]&quot; response to Louisiana and New Orleans in the weeks following the disaster.

===Criticism of government response===
{{Main|Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina}}
[[File:USNS Comfort.jpg|thumb|upright|[[USNS Comfort|USNS ''Comfort'']] takes on supplies at [[Mayport, Florida]] en route to the Gulf Coast.]]
The criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of criticism of [[Administrative incompetence|mismanagement]] and lack of [[leadership]] in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath. More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the Crescent City.&lt;ref name=&quot;thevenot&quot; /&gt; The [[neologism]] ''Katrina[[-gate|gate]]'' was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for &quot;2005 word of the year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Heather. &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060325135124/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1480616 Linguists Vote 'Truthiness' Word of 2005].&quot; ''ABC News.'' January 6, 2006. Retrieved on 2010-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of Katrina's August 29, 2005 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the hurricane. [[Criticism]] was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without [[drinking water|water]], [[food]] or shelter. Deaths from [[thirst]], [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]], and [[violence]], days after the storm had passed, fueled the criticism, as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the Louisiana Superdome (designed to handle 800, yet 30,000 arrived) and the New Orleans Civic Center (not designed as an evacuation center, yet 25,000 arrived). Some alleged that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. 

In accordance with federal law, President George W. Bush directed the [[Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security]], Michael Chertoff, to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated [[Michael D. Brown]], head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination. Brown claimed that Governor Blanco resisted their efforts and was unhelpful. Governor Blanco and her staff disputed this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = David Kirkpatrick and Scott Shane | title = Ex-FEMA Chief Tells of Frustration and Chaos | date = September 15, 2005 | accessdate = 2010-05-13|publisher = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/15/national/nationalspecial/15brown.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, Brown was recalled to Washington and Coast Guard Vice Admiral [[Thad W.

During ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane, rapper [[Kanye West]] veered off script and harshly criticized the government's response to the crisis, stating that &quot;George Bush doesn't care about [[black people]].&quot; Although the camera quickly cut away, and the scene was deleted from delayed broadcasts, West's comments still reached the East Coast broadcasts, and were replayed and discussed afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|title=Kanye West's Torrent of Criticism, Live on NBC|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090300165.html|work=The Washington Post|date=2005-09-03|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush later called West's remarks 'the worst moment in his presidency', feeling he was unjustly accused of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CHAPPELL|first=BILL |title=Bush Says Kanye West's Attack Was Low Point Of His Presidency; West Agrees|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/11/03/131052717/bush-says-kanye-west-s-attack-was-low-point-of-his-presidency|work=NPR|date=2010-11-03|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Kanye West and Mike Myers met again on a brief sketch on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', in which Myers joked that since the telethon, the government has stripped him of his American citizenship (&quot;still got my Canadian citizenship to fall back on,&quot; Myers joked), and placed him under heavy government surveillance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} --&gt;
Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits and journalists of all stripes was directed at the local and state governments headed by Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongressInvestigation&quot;/&gt;

The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina raised other, more general public policy issues about [[emergency management]], [[environmental policy]], [[poverty]], and [[unemployment]]. The discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected [[elections]] and [[legislation]] enacted at various [[Executive (government)|levels of government]]. The storm's devastation also prompted a Congressional investigation, which found that FEMA and the Red Cross &quot;did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of Gulf coast victims.&quot; Additionally, it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongressInvestigation&quot;/&gt;

An ABC News [[Opinion poll|poll]] conducted on September 2, 2005, showed more blame was being directed at state and local governments (75%) than at the Federal government (67%), with 44% blaming Bush's leadership directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnewspoll&quot;&gt;Langer, Gary. &quot;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=1094262&amp;page=1 Poll: Bush Not Taking Brunt of Katrina Criticism].&quot; ''ABC News.''

Many corporations also contributed to relief efforts. On September 13, 2005, it was reported that corporate donations to the relief effort were $409&amp;nbsp;million, and were expected to exceed $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/13/news/fortune500/katrina_donations/ Corporate Katrina gifts could top $1B].&quot; ''CNN.''

During and after the Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, the American Red Cross had opened 1,470 different shelters across and registered 3.8&amp;nbsp;million overnight stays. None were allowed in New Orleans however. A total of 244,000 Red Cross workers (95% of which were non-paid volunteers) were utilized throughout these three hurricanes. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (such as toothpaste, soap, washcloths and toys for children) and 205,360 cleanup kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. For mass care, the organization served 68&amp;nbsp;million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers. The Red Cross also had its Disaster Health services meet 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services met 826,590 contacts. Red Cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4&amp;nbsp;million families. Hurricane Katrina was the first natural disaster in the United States in which the American Red Cross utilized its &quot;Safe and Well&quot; family location website.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARC 1 yr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[American Red Cross]] | title = A Year of Healing |month=August | date = 2006-09-29 | url = http://www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/Katrina_OneYearReport.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ARC 2005AHS facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = American Red Cross | title = Hurricane Season 2005: Facts and Figures|date = 2006-09-29 | url = http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/2005/facts.html}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year following Katrina's strike on the Gulf Coast, The Salvation Army allocated donations of more than $365&amp;nbsp;million to serve more than 1.7&amp;nbsp;million people in nearly every state. The organization's immediate response to Hurricane Katrina included more than 5.7&amp;nbsp;million hot meals served in and around New Orleans, 8.3&amp;nbsp;million sandwiches, snacks &amp; drinks. Its SATERN network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000&amp;nbsp;survivors. Salvation Army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals.

===Analysis of New Orleans levee failures===
{{Main|2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans}}
[[File:Hurricane Katrina Eye viewed from Hurricane Hunter.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the eyewall of Hurricane Katrina taken on August 28, 2005, as seen from a [[NOAA]] [[WP-3D Orion|WP-3D]] [[hurricane hunter]] aircraft before the storm made landfall on the United States [[Gulf Coast]].]]
A June 2007 report released by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] states that the failures of the locally built and federally funded levees in New Orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design flaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCE HKERP report&quot;/&gt; The [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] who by federal mandate is responsible for the conception, design and construction of the region's flood-control system failed to pay sufficient attention to public safety.

According to modeling and field observations by a team from [[Louisiana State University]], the [[Mississippi River – Gulf Outlet Canal|Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO)]], a 200-meter-wide (660-foot-wide) canal designed to provide a shortcut from New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico, helped provide a funnel for the storm surge, making it 20% higher and 100%-200% faster as it crashed into the city. St. Bernard Parish, one of the more devastated areas, lies just south of the MRGO. The Corps of Engineers disputes this causality and maintains Katrina would have overwhelmed the levees with or without the contributing effect of the MRGO.&lt;ref&gt;Warrick, Joby; Grunwald, Michael. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301200_pf.html Investigators Link Levee Failures to Design Flaws].&quot; ''Washington Post.'' October 24, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The water flowing west from the storm surge was perpendicular to MRGO, and thus the canal had a negligible effect.

There was unfounded speculation made by residents concerning a possible planned levee breach. Many references are made to the 1927 flood in which a levee was breached south of New Orleans in order to divert floodwater to the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/pao/RELEASES/02-06_1927_Flood_Anniversary2.htm |title=75th Anniversary of the Great Flood of 1927|publisher=Mvn.usace.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently,{{when|date=February 2012}} the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nature Conservancy have developed a floodplain reconnection project in which the Ouachita River would be connected to its floodplain and the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/louisiana/press/press4039.html |title=Louisiana Nature Conservation, Environment Issues &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breach in the levee{{vague|date=February 2012}} caused the water level downstream to drop six inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) in a previous event in the early 1990s. Both cases show the many benefits of allowing the river to run its course.{{synthesis-inline|date=February 2012}}

On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General [[Carl Strock]], [[Chief of Engineers]] and Commander of the Corps of Engineers, testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that &quot;We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writers &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080527010320/http://www.unregisterednews.com/content/view/184/53/ Problems with the design of levees].&quot; ''[[Unregistered News]].'' September 29, 2005. Retrieved on 2010-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to August 29, 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted, however, by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study by the Corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Corps chief admits to 'design failure' | author = Walsh, Bill | publisher = Times Picayune|date = April 6, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-09 | url = http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1144306231230500.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of Katrina. In reconstructing them, precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety. For example, in every situation possible, the Corps of Engineers replaced I-walls with T-walls. T-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls.&lt;ref name=Walls&gt;{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Crenson | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/story.asp?story=6589 | title=Levee Repairs to Be Finished By First Day of Hurricane Season | date=2006-02-02 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements. In February 2008, the Bush administration requested that the state of Louisiana pay about $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion of an estimated $7.2&amp;nbsp;billion for Corps of Engineers levee work (in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by Congress as early as the [[Flood Control Act of 1928]]), a proposal which angered many Louisiana leaders.&lt;ref name=funding&gt;{{cite news | title=White House Budget for Levee Work Riles Many Louisiana Elected Officials | agency=Associated Press | first=Cain | last=Burdeau | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10045 | date=2008-02-12 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2008, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal used a speech to The National Press Club to request that President Bush free up money to complete work on Louisiana's levees. Bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget, but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill, which would pass sooner.&lt;ref name=BushJindal&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/18539869.html | title =Jindal asks Bush for levee cash | publisher=2theadvocate.com | first=Gerard | last=Shields | date=2008-05-03 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media involvement===
{{Main|Media coverage of Hurricane Katrina}}
Many representatives of the [[news media]] reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities.

The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when [[Geraldo Rivera]] of [[Fox News]] tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2678976 Geraldo Rivera &amp; Shepard Smith Unleashed]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}.&quot;&amp;nbsp;— ''Video.'' 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of [[Website|Internet sites]]—especially [[blogging]] and [[community journalism]]. One example was the effort of ''NOLA.com'', the web affiliate of New Orleans' ''[[The Times-Picayune|Times-Picayune]]''. A group of reporters from the paper including Doug MacCash, Manuel Torres, [[Trymaine Lee]], and Mark Schleifstein were awarded the Breaking News [[Pulitzer Prize]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulitzer BN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners&amp;nbsp;— Breaking News Reporting | year= 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Breaking+News+Reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Times-Picayune shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based ''[[The Sun Herald|Sun Herald]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulitzer PS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners&amp;nbsp;— Public Service | year= 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Public+Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams—from individuals to the Coast Guard—which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;OJR NOLA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Mark Glaser | title = NOLA.com blogs and forums help save lives after Katrina | date = September 13, 2005 | publisher = Online Journalism Review | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050913glaser/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulitzer speech&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Paul Steiger]] | title = Remarks at Pulitzer Prize luncheon|date = May 22, 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | publisher = The Pulitzer Board | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/2006_luncheon_steiger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of AM radio was of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news. [[AM radio]] provided emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims. Immediately after Hurricane Katrina, radio station [[WWL-AM]] (New Orleans) was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air. The 870&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency has a [[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]] high power designation and the on-going nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to {{convert|500|mi|km}} away. Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=radio&amp;cdn=gadgets&amp;tm=58&amp;f=00&amp;su=p504.1.336.ip_&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=0&amp;bts=0&amp;st=23&amp;zu=http%3A//www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp%3Fvnu_content_id%3D1001052023|title=Local Media Outlets Struggle to Carry On Post Katrina|date=2005-08-31|accessdate=2010-04-14|author=Katy Bachman and Tony Sanders|publisher=Billboard Radio Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of several weeks when most area radio stations were off the air, WWL-AM's emergency coverage was simulcast on the frequencies of other area radio stations. This emergency service was named &quot;[[United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans|The United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans]].&quot; To reach emergency radio operators in storm-ravaged areas, many of whom made their volunteer services available to the Red Cross and government entities, WWL-AM was simulcast on shortwave outlet [[WHRI]], owned by World Harvest Radio International. The [[cellular phone]] antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months.

As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On September 9, the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have &quot;zero access&quot; to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, CNN filed a [[lawsuit]] and obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Media Ban&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/09/10/katrina.media/ U.S. won't ban media from New Orleans searches].&quot; ''CNN.''

===Retirement===
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Because of the large death toll and destruction of property along the [[Gulf Coast]], the name Katrina was officially retired on April 6, 2006 by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] at the request of the U.S. government. The name will never again be used for another [[North Atlantic hurricane]]. It was replaced by [[Hurricane Katia|Katia]] on List III of the [[Atlantic hurricane naming lists]], which was used in the [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2607.htm|title = Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma &quot;Retired&quot; from List of Storm Names|accessdate = August 28, 2006|date = April 6, 2006|publisher = NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstruction of each section of the southern portion of Louisiana has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR (Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration) Final Technical Report, which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas where buildings need to be elevated.&lt;ref name=&quot;The LACPR Home Page&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacpr.usace.army.mil/|title=The LACPR Home Page|author=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]|publisher=[[United States Army]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Technical Report includes:
* locations of possible new levees to be built
* suggested existing levee modifications
* &quot;Inundation Zones&quot;, &quot;Water depths less than 14 feet, Raise-In-Place of Structures&quot;, &quot;Water depths greater than 14 feet, Buyout of Structures&quot;, &quot;Velocity Zones&quot; and &quot;Buyout of Structures&quot; areas for five different scenarios.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted the report to the U.S. Congress for consideration, planning, and response in mid-2009.

==Representation in other media==
*Hurricane Katrina has also been the subject of several documentary films, including [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[When the Levees Broke]]'', and [[Darren Martinez]]'s film, ''Hellp''.&lt;ref&gt;Britt, M. &quot;Las Vegas Teen Helps Hurricane Victims In New Orleans&quot;, ''Las Vegas Daily Optic'', December 19, 2005,&lt;/ref&gt; 
*An episode of the Fox TV series ''[[House (TV Series)|House]],'' first broadcast on May 16, 2006, featured a teenage victim of Hurricane Katrina in the medical storyline. 
*An [[Top Gear: US Special|episode]] of the [[BBC]] show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV Series)|Top Gear]]'' was praised for being one of the first to show the full scale of the destruction after the waters had receded.
*[[David Eggars]]' non-fiction book, ''[[Zeitoun]],'' featured an Arab-American family man caught in an anti-terrorist round-up as he was trying to help neighbors in the aftermath of the hurricane.

'''Clarence Ray Nagin, Jr.''' (born June 11, 1956), also known as '''C. Ray Nagin''', is an American consultant, entrepreneur, author, and public speaker who served from 2002 to 2010 as the [[mayor of New Orleans|60th]] [[mayor of New Orleans|mayor]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. He gained international note in 2005 in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a historic, catastrophic disaster which devastated the New Orleans area.

Nagin was first elected in March 2002 and received significant crossover vote from just about every segment of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Election Results 2002&quot;&gt;Louisiana Secretary of State Election Results, March 2, 2002, Mayor City of New Orleans.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was re-elected in 2006 even though the election was held with at least two-thirds of New Orleans citizens still displaced after Katrina struck. He was term limited by law and left office on May 3, 2010.

After leaving office, Nagin founded CRN Initiatives LLC, a firm that focuses on Emergency Preparedness, Green Energy product development, Publishing and Public Speaking. He wrote and self-published his first book, ''Katrina Secrets: Storms after the Storms'' which gives a first-hand account of how New Orleans overcame the storm.

On January 18, 2013, Nagin was indicted on twenty-one corruption charges, including [[wire fraud]], [[bribery]] and [[money laundering]] related to his dealings with city vendors following Hurricane Katrina disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin indicted for corruption|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/18/us-usa-crime-nagin-idUSBRE90H12U20130118|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from college he went to work in the purchasing department at [[General Motors]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. He moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], then to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1981 to take Internal Audit Manager and Division Controller jobs with Associates Corp.&lt;ref name=Tulane/&gt; 

In 1982, Nagin married Seletha Smith, a New Orleans native.&lt;ref name=Tulane/&gt;  Together, they have three children: Jeremy, Jarin, and Tianna.{{fact|date=March 2013}} In 1985, Nagin returned to New Orleans to become the controller of Cox New Orleans, the city's cable television franchise,&lt;ref name=Tulane/&gt; run by media conglomerate [[Cox Enterprises|Cox]]. The franchise had a history of customer complaints, low profits, stagnant growth and was one of the poorest-performing components within Cox.  Nagin was quickly promoted to general manager and implemented an upgrade of the system to 750&amp;nbsp;MHz, spent over $500 million on developing its [[fiber-optic cable]], and introduced new services, including digital cable television, high speed internet and telephony. In 1989, he was appointed to oversee all of Cox properties in south Louisiana as vice-president and general manager of Cox Louisiana. Between 1985 and 2002, eight hundred jobs were added.  By the end of his tenure, 85 percent of customers reported satisfaction with Cox services, compared to less than half in 1989. Cox Louisiana became one of Cox's best-performing units.&lt;ref name=Tulane/&gt; 

In 1993, Nagin enrolled in the executive [[MBA]] program at [[Tulane University]], a national ranked curriculum.&lt;ref name=Tulane/&gt;  Mark Miester, Editor of [http://freemanblog.freeman.tulane.edu/freemanmag/ Freeman Magazine] for the [[A.

In 1995, Nagin received the Young Leadership Council Diversity and Role Model Award, and later sat on the boards of the [[United Way of America|United Way]], [[Covenant House]], [[Greater New Orleans Education Foundation]]. He also was one of the founders and president of [[100 Black Men]] of metro New Orleans, an affiliate of the national organization of African-American businessmen.   In 1998 he led a group of diverse investors to bring professional ice hockey to New Orleans, the [[New Orleans Brass]].{{fact|date=March 2013}} Nagin became the team's president and investors' spokesman as they secured this historic hockey franchise.&lt;ref name=Tulane/&gt;  The initial popularity of the team allowed the group to secure the 18,000 seat [[New Orleans Arena]] as its home venue.&lt;ref name=Tulane/&gt;  That year, the local alternative newspaper ''[[Gambit Weekly]]'' named Nagin as its New Orleanian of the Year.{{fact|date=March 2013}}

==2002 mayoral election==
{{Main|New Orleans mayoral election, 2002}}
{{Original research|section|date=January 2013}} 
The 2002 mayoral race found citizens uninspired by the city's lethargic economy and traditional political candidates entering the race. While discussing this with his teenage sons and friends, Nagin discovered that they all were planning to leave New Orleans after college as they did not see enough opportunities. At that point Nagin concluded he needed to get involved in helping the city at a much higher level.

He did not seek any other public office prior to his election in 2002. More controversially, Nagin had actually been a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for most of his adult life, having switched to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] shortly before seeking office, for which his candidacy was branded as opportunistic in the solidly Democrat city. Nagin was, at that time, a known supporter of [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]], having contributed to the president’s campaign. Nagin entered the New Orleans mayoral race a political unknown but emerged through the middle of a crowded field of known Democrats, securing vital cross-party and in-party endorsements for his populist pledges to tackle city hall corruption and run the administration in a more business-like manner.

Nagin entered the race for mayor on the final day of qualifying. There were already fourteen other better known candidates that had announced their candidacy. Nagin was at first considered a long shot as he was not backed by any of the city's established political organizations. He hired Jim Carvin, an elder campaign manager who had never lost a mayoral race. 

Nagin was a quick study, excelled in debates and connected with voters. Many citizens favored Nagin's expressions of disgust with traditional Louisiana politics, including promises to fight political corruption and run the city in a more businesslike manner. Shortly before the primary mayoral election, on January 17, 2002, the ''[[New Orleans Times Picayune]]'' and ''[[Gambit Weekly]]'' endorsed Nagin as a reformer. His message of change, economic prosperity, and accountability along with other late endorsements, gave him crucial momentum that would carry through the primary and runoff elections.

In the first round of the crowded mayoral election in February 2002, Nagin won first place with 29 percent of the vote. Some of his opponents were the Police Chief [[Richard Pennington]], [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Paulette Irons]], and City Councilman [[Troy Carter (politician)|Troy Carter]]. In the runoff on Saturday, March 2, 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;State Election Results 2002&quot;/&gt; Nagin defeated [[Richard Pennington]] with 59 percent of the votes to become the 60th mayor of New Orleans.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Election Results 2002&quot;/&gt;

==First term==
Shortly after taking office, Nagin launched an anti-corruption campaign within city government, including crackdowns on the New Orleans Taxicab Bureau and Utilities Department. Media scenes of corrupt officials being led out of City Hall in handcuffs were received with surprised enthusiasm by much of the public. When an investigation into corruption among city vehicle inspection (locally known as &quot;brake tag&quot; inspection) certification workers suggested that corruption was systemic, Nagin fired the entire department's workforce. In fact, when Nagin was asked what should be done about his cousin, who was implicated in the taxi cab bureau scandals, Nagin said &quot;if he's guilty, arrest him.&quot; Nagin's cousin was later arrested.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. (May 21, 2006). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4623922.stm Profile: Ray Nagin]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the City of New Orleans as certified by CPA firm KPMG highlighted many significant accomplishments of the Nagin administration. New Orleans gains 4,500 jobs that year. U.S. Census Bureau figures showed about 38,000 New Orleanians had risen out of poverty as the national average increased. Targeted policies to stimulate business growth, enhance job skill training and homeownership for single parent households were credited. According to ''The American City Business Journal'', per capita income in New Orleans was rising at the fastest rate in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;app1.lla.state.la.us/PublicReports.nsf/98F3165C819D1B...&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern Business and Development named New Orleans number eight on the list of &quot;come back kids&quot; in the south. New Orleans had back to back record tourist years, 10.1 million in 2004. Yahoo/National Geographic Traveler poll named the city its number one family destination. Since 2002, the area had seen over $400 million of film productions, including movies like the Oscar-award winning ''Ray'' with Jamie Foxx and ''All the King's Men'', featuring Sean Penn. According to ''Moviemaker Magazine'', New Orleans was the 4th best place to film a movie and had earned the title &quot;Hollywood South&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In November 2004, the Nagin administration passed the city's largest bond issue, $260 million. New Orleans also implemented unprecedented technology and jumped from 69th to 38th on Intel's list of &quot;Most Wired Cities&quot;. The city's website went from being unranked to the 4th best in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

As [[Hurricane Ivan]] threatened the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in September 2004, Nagin urged New Orleanians to be ready for the storm. In an effort to get the public's attention and bust through media clutter he advised evacuees to have some &quot;Benjamins&quot; ($100 bills) handy and urged those planning to stay not only to stock up on food and water but also to make sure they had &quot;an axe in the attic,&quot;. This was a reference to the many people trapped in their attics by rising floodwaters when [[Hurricane Betsy]] hit the city in 1965. Nagin issued a voluntary evacuation call at 6 pm on September 13 and the interstates quickly filled as some 600,000 metro New Orleanians left. Traffic was so heavy that some trips took 12 hours or more. Fortunately, the hurricane missed the city like many others.

Nagin endorsed conservative Republican [[Bobby Jindal]] over conservative Democratic [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Kathleen Blanco]] in the 2003 [[election|runoff]] for [[governor of Louisiana|governor]]. Both candidates platforms were almost identical, so Nagin requested each write a letter detailing what they would do for the citizens of New Orleans if elected. Jindal wrote a very detailed plan while Blanco sent a one page, two paragraph letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdsu.com/politics/2604218/detail.html |title=Nagin Endorses Jindal &amp;#124; WDSU Home – WDSU Home |publisher=Wdsu.com |date=2003-11-03 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurricane Katrina==
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina President Bush with New Orleans Mayor.jpg|thumb|250px|Then [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin (September 2, 2005)]]
{{main|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans}}

In August 2005 Hurricane Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico. Early on Friday, August 26, Mayor Nagin advised New Orleanians to keep a close eye on the storm and prepare for evacuation. He then made several public statements encouraging people to leave. By 10 a.m. Saturday, a mandatory evacuation was called for low-lying areas in the surrounding parishes—[[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles]], [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany]], [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines]], and [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson]]—and a voluntary evacuation for [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]]. In addition to the parishes' announcements, President George W. Bush declared a federal state of emergency for Louisiana.

In accordance with the regional evacuation plan, New Orleans along with the surrounding areas of Jefferson and St. Charles parishes were given formal voluntary evacuation orders around fifty hours from landfall. This phased approach along with &quot;[[Contraflow lane reversal|contraflow]]&quot; where all incoming interstate highway lanes are reversed outward ensured that additional vehicles moving onto already congested roads would not create massive gridlock. The local newspaper reported that Nagin stopped short of ordering a mandatory evacuation because of concerns about the city's liability for closing hotels and other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1125213007249320.xml Katrina Takes Aim] – Bruce Nolan, ''[[The Times Picayune]]'', August 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was never confirmed by anyone directly involved in the city's decision making process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagin, C. R 2011&quot;&gt;Nagin, C. R (2011), ''Katrina's Secrets: Storms after the Storm''&lt;/ref&gt; 
After receiving a late night Saturday call from Max Mayfield, head of the National Hurricane Center, Nagin was advised there was final clarity on where Katrina was headed, to New Orleans. He immediately ordered the city attorney to prepare legal documents for calling a mandatory evacuation of the city, the first in New Orleans' almost 300 year history. The legal team worked through the night and on Sunday, August 28 at 9:30 a.m., the mandatory evacuation order was signed and communicated to the public. The Superdome was opened as a shelter of last resort and police went throughout the city with loudspeakers alerting all remaining citizens to go to key pickup points for free bus rides. By Sunday evening 95% of New Orleanians and visitors were successfully evacuated or relocated out of harm's way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagin, C. R 2011&quot;/&gt;

After the hurricane hit, the locally built and maintained levees collapsed throughout the city. 80% of the city flooded, some areas as high as 20 feet, over rooftops. With each passing day, food and water became scarce. Looting became uncontrollable. All communication was down. After an officer had been shot, local law enforcement pleaded for martial law but were forced out after two days.  Martial law was then subsequently declared. After hearing reports on his wind up radio, Nagin blasted the slow federal and state response on WWL radio and his passionate outburst went viral all over the world despite the fact that he ignored both federal and state help and recommendations for evacuation five days before the storm hit. As public pressure swelled, federal and state officials were forced to act. After seven full days, the last stranded citizen was evacuated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagin, C. R 2011&quot;/&gt;

==&quot;Chocolate City&quot; speech==
{{Main|Chocolate City speech}}

At a [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] celebration speech in New Orleans on January 16, 2006, Nagin used the phrase &quot;Chocolate City&quot; to signal that New Orleans would once again be as diverse a city as it was before Katrina. He also forcefully addressed black on black crime relative to recent shootings during a second line parade.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwltv.com&quot;&gt;www.wwltv.com/.../Full-video-of-Nagins-chocolate-city-speech-923...&lt;/ref&gt; Nagin repeated the &quot;Chocolate City&quot; metaphor and proclaimed that New Orleans would be &quot;chocolate again.&quot; This was seized upon and parodied by some commentators, cartoons, and merchandising. Various designs of T-shirts with satirical depictions of Nagin as [[Willy Wonka]] were sold in the city and on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Nagin also stated that New Orleans &quot;will be a majority African-American city because this was what God wants it to be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/17/nagin.city/index.html Nagin apologizes for 'chocolate' city comments] – CNN, January 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain people found the implication of Nagin claiming to know God's will as troubling as the racial aspects of his speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060619/sublette |title=In the Magazine |date=

In an interview with [[Tavis Smiley]] broadcast on [[Public Radio International]] on January 13, 2006, Nagin said he used the phrase &quot;chocolate city&quot; in reference to a time in the 1970s when African Americans were just started to exercise political power in places like Washington, D.C. The term had been used in many of Nagin's previous speeches and welcoming addresses to visitors of the city. The idea reportedly originated with the song &quot;[[Chocolate City (song)|Chocolate City]]&quot; by the popular 1970s funk group ''[[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]''. &lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Andrew (May 28, 2006).

(2011) &quot;Katrina's Secrets: Storms after the Storm&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 mayoral election==
{{Main|New Orleans mayoral election, 2006}}

The 2006 mayoral race was one of the most expensive in New Orleans history.{{cn|date=December 2012}} At the time of this election, at least two-thirds of its residents were still displaced. One candidate said in his ''Times Picayune'' interview he was running because the city's demographics had dramatically changed. There were three unsuccessful lawsuits filed to prevent delaying the original election date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/world/americas/01iht-notes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The state first performed a voter purge and then set up a complicated voting process that required most displaced voters to travel back home. In addition, elaborate absentee voting procedures were required to included multiple mailings, notarizing documents and extensive verifications. An April 1 protest march in the city called for satellite voting to give displaced voters the same rights as those who had returned.

In the April 22 election, Nagin was the front runner with 38% of the vote. Louisiana Lieutenant Governor [[Mitch Landrieu]] came in second with 29%. Nagin and Landrieu faced each other in a run-off election on May 20, 2006. Nagin defeated Landrieu 52% to 48%.

==Second term==
Nagin's second term began on June 1, 2006. He was intensely criticized by the local media throughout this term. For example, his &quot;100 day plan&quot; to accelerate the rebuilding of New Orleans was bashed for what critics said was a tardy release, lack of details and activity in moving forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Unprecedented challenges included: all public transportation needed to be restarted, stoplights and street signs were destroyed, the city’s world famous street cars were in total disrepair, bankruptcy was a real threat, bonds were downgraded to junk status, half the city’s workforce was laid off, millions of tons of storm debris and construction trash had to be removed, construction costs tripled and an historic number of building permits needed to be issued.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;blog.nola.com/times.../2007/05/text_of_mayor_ray_nagins_state.htm...Cached – Similar&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagin reorganized city government, launched an innovative internet based Kiosk system to issue permits, successfully lobbied to increase the federal community disaster loan from a $5 million limit to 50% of the city's annual revenues, stabilized real estate and tourism markets, restored the city’s bond rating to investment grade, initiated Disney like &amp; semi-automated garbage collections in 2007 and pushed unprecedented public housing transformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

In 2006, Nagin was also criticized for devoting time to extensive lobbying in Washington, DC and a national speaking tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nagin's administration countered this criticism by stating this was necessary in order to correct inaccurate perceptions of New Orleans and secure much needed recovery support. 

In addition during 2007, a drastic increase in the city’s violent crime rate led to more criticism of Nagin. A destroyed criminal justice system, post tramatic stress and a severely depleted police force were key contributors to this rise in activity. Nagin called for and got help from the Louisiana National Guard and U.S. Justice Department. However, Nagin continued to be heavily criticized by the local newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He reignited complaints when he said news of two killings should keep focus on the city's needs for more help and, “while sad, keeps the New Orleans brand out there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20310441/ |title=www.msnbc.msn.com &quot;Violent crime wave intensifies in New Orleans&quot; |publisher=MSNBC |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagin hired recovery expert Dr. [[Ed Blakely]] in 2007 to head up a dedicated Office of Recovery Management. Rockefeller, Ford and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundations provided grants for critical staff enhancements. During the end of 2007 and into 2008 Nagin guided the city through an extensive planning process that documented a $14 billion need. However, the state only allocated 2% of the plan and it took almost 3 years to receive any of these federal recovery dollars.&lt;ref&gt;www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

With such limited resources, the city came up with the &quot;Citywide Strategic Recovery &amp; Redevelopment Plan&quot; or target area strategy to focus public and private recovery investments. There were 17 initial target areas with commercial centers and clustered residential redevelopment. This strategy proved to be effective as for every $1 of public sector investment was followed by $188 in private sector investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/.../City_Wide_Plan/Cover_and_Ta ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average recovery from a disaster like Hurricane Katrina normally takes 10 to 15 years. Kobe, Japan took 15 years, Watts took 10 years and New York is still recovery from the 911 terrorist attacks after 11 years. By years 4 and 5, New Orleans made significant progress toward full recovery. 85% of all city managed recovery projects were either recently completed, under construction or in final design. By the end of 2009, there were over $20 billion in public &amp; private sector construction related projects underway.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurstvillesecurity.com/images/page_uploads/2009StateoftheCityCover.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, national groups took notice. ''Business Week'' said New Orleans was one of the best cities in America to ride out the great recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/08/10/1014_recession_cities/10.htm |title=The Best Cities for Riding Out a Recession: New Orleans, La. – BusinessWeek |publisher=Images.businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Money'' Magazine ranked the city as the sixth fastest growing real estate market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/moneymag/...moneymag/6.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Outside'' Magazine said New Orleans was the 20th best town in American to live in.&lt;ref&gt;www.city-data.com › ... › US Forums › California › San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor in its April 2010 report said New Orleans had the lowest unemployment in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Catherine Clifford, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/10/real_estate/fastest_growing/index.htm |title=U.S.: New Orleans is nation's fastest growing big city – Jul. 10, 2008 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to leaving office in 2010, Nagin was appointed by Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] to head the United States delegation to a state and local governments conference on assistance to post-earthquake [[Haiti]] held in [[Martinique]]. A recovery plan was completed and presented to donor nations resulting in Haiti receiving billions in pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/s/srgia/2010/145138.htm |title=State And Local Government Meeting |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in office, Nagin was a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtml| title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns: Coalition Members | accessdate=May 18, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] and Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]].

==2011 and beyond==
Now as a consultant, public speaker and recovery expert, Nagin travels the country and world to give advice to governments, universities and private sector on emergency preparedness. He had worked extensively in Europe, Canada, Haiti, the Caribbean and Australia. ”I think New Orleans is a key study of a horrific catastrophe and how we struggled to plan and implement to get the city back to recovery,” he said. ”I will tell you that there are lessons for Australia in trying to recover and authorities could well look at us. One of the key things is to engage the citizens in a big way. They must be involved so they own the recovery.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Sydney Morning Herald'' http://www.smh.com.au/national/let-people-own-recovery-exmayors-katrina-lesson-20110921-1kl9g.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2013, Nagin was indicted on 21 corruption charges including [[wire fraud]], [[bribery]] and [[money laundering]] related to his dealings with city vendors following the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster. The charges are the outgrowth of a City Hall corruption investigation that already resulted in guilty pleas by two former city officials and two businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin indicted for corruption|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/18/us-usa-crime-nagin-idUSBRE90H12U20130118|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and indictment==
In 2004, Ray Nagin's two sons started a family business, Stone Age, LLC, with their parents' financial backing.  Stone Age, LLC, received a contract with [[Home Depot]] after Hurricane Katrina. Stone Age, LLC, was a granite and marble business that focused primarily on the residential market.  When Stone Age registered as a home-improvement business with the state Licensing Board for Contractors the application showed that Seletha Nagin, Nagin's wife, signed as a witness, and the document was notarized by attorney Penya Moses-Fields. There was no evidence that Nagin's stake in Stone Age ever exceeded 25% and therefore, there was no violation of state ethics laws.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, G. (March 22, 2008).  &quot;[http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/03/nagin_familys_company_got_deal.html Nagin family's company got the deal with Home Depot]&quot;.  ''Times-Picayune''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone Age, LLC, is currently &quot;Not In Good Standing for failure to file Annual Report&quot; with the Louisiana Secretary of State as the company is currently inactive but eligible for reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana, Secretary of State. (2011).  ''Corporate Report''.  Charter Number 35868097K. Baton Rouge, LA: State of Louisiana&lt;/ref&gt;

At a town hall meeting in October 2005, Nagin said: ''&quot;I can see in your eyes, you want to know, 'How do I take advantage of this incredible opportunity? How do I make sure New Orleans is not overrun with Mexican workers&quot;. ''This was in response to a question from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2005/12/04/a-new-spice-in... – Cached]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hispanic groups, including the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, criticized Nagin's statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&amp;id=5044&amp;cha=11 USHCC Deplores Remarks by New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin Regarding Mexican Workers and the Rebuilding of New Orleans] – Hispanic PR Wire, October 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During a subsequent interview on Telemundo with Jose Diaz-Balart, Nagin praised the great work Hispanic workers did in New Orleans and said the city would not have recovered without them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enfoque.msnlatino.telemundo.com/los-secretos-de-katrina.php |title=Los secretos de Katrina &amp;#124; Enfoque &amp;#124; Telemundo |publisher=Enfoque.msnlatino.telemundo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2009, the ''Times-Picayune'' alleged a conflict of interest with regard to a trip Nagin took to Hawaii in 2004. The Hawaiian vacation Mayor Ray Nagin, then-chief technology officer Greg Meffert and their families took in 2004 was claimed to be partially paid for by Meffert but years later it was revealed that a contractor paid for Nagin's plane ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donze &amp; David Hammer, &quot;City vendor financed Nagin trip to Hawaii&quot; in ''Times-Picayune'', April 7, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A4 (quotation appears on p. A1) (web version = [http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/city_vendor_financed_mayor_ray.html City vendor financed Mayor Ray Nagin's trip to Hawaii, Meffert says in deposition.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2009, Nagin was obliged &quot;to sit for a deposition as part of a civil lawsuit over the city's controversial crime camera program.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Krupa, [http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-12/1240119372133260.xml&amp;coll=1 Nagin to face camera contract queries,] ''Times-Picayune'', April 19, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A10 (quotation appears on p. A1).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Times-Picayune'' had obtained information that Mark St. Pierre, who allegedly paid for the holiday, had made substantial donations to Nagin's 2006 re-election campaign.  

Nagin's Chief Technology Officer, Greg Meffert, was later charged with sixty-three felony counts in what authorities say &quot;was a lucrative kickback scheme.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, D. (November 6, 2009).  [http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/02/post_315.html &quot;Greg Meffert, wife, City Hall vendor to be arraigned on 63 counts Thursday in bribery scheme&quot;].

[http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/fromer_city_tech_chief_pleads.html &quot;Greg Meffert, former city tech chief, pleads guilty&quot;].  ''Times-Picayune''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported that Ray Nagin was the target of a federal [[grand jury]] investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Nagin is focus of federal grand jury probe|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/02/federal_investigation_of_ray_n.html|location=New Orleans |work=The Times Picayune|date=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2012, Frank Fradella who was facing major securities fraud charges, pled guilty in New Orleans federal court to one count of conspiracy to bribe Nagin. This plea deal guaranteed him a significantly shorter jail sentence and exemption from asset forfeiture. According to ''The Times-Picayune'', Fradella claims to have paid Nagin $50,000 and delivered corrupt truckloads of free granite in exchange for favorable treatment for Fradella's companies with city contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Nagin supposedly received $50,000 payment records and sources say|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/06/banking_felon_funneled_50000_p.html|location=New Orleans |work=The Times Picayune|date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2013, Nagin was charged with wire fraud, [[conspiracy]], bribery, money laundering and filing false tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wdsu.com/blob/view/-/18188514/data/2/-/86binu/-/PDF--Indictment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 21-count federal corruption charges were issued by a [[grand jury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin indicted |author=Rick Jervis |url=http://m.usatoday.com/article/news/1845617?preferredArticleViewMode=single |newspaper=USA Today |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed reports that negotiations between prosecutors and Nagin's defense attorney failed to produce a [[plea bargain]].{{fact|date=January 2013}} On February 20, 2013,  Nagin pleaded not guilty in federal court to charges that he accepted kickbacks in exchange for city contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former New Orleans Mayor Nagin pleads not guilty in kickbacks case|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-usa-crime-nagin-idUSBRE91J18120130220|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael DeWayne Brown''' (born November 8, 1954) served as the first Undersecretary of Emergency Preparedness and Response (EP&amp;R), a division of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). This position is generally referred to as the director or administrator of the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA). He was appointed in January 2003 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and resigned following his controversial handling of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005.  Brown first had been appointed as General Counsel at FEMA.  After the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]] President Bush nominated Brown to become Deputy Director of FEMA. Brown currently hosts a radio talk show on 630 [[KHOW]] in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khow.com/pages/michaelbrown.html 630 KHOW]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brown was born in [[Guymon, Oklahoma]], on November 8, 1954. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[public administration]]/[[political science]] from the [[University of Central Oklahoma|Central State University]] (now the [[University of Central Oklahoma]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. He was named the Outstanding Political Science Senior{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.  He received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Oklahoma City University School of Law]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/brown-bio.html| title= Michael Brown Biography|publisher= Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was in college, from 1975 to 1978, he handled &quot;labor and budget matters&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Enid Attorney Hopes to Unseat English&quot;, ''[[The Oklahoman]]'', October 16, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; as an assistant to the [[city manager]] of [[Edmond, Oklahoma]] (1980 population of 34,637). His [[White House]] biography stated that he had [[emergency service]]s oversight in this position.&lt;ref name=whitehouse/&gt; However, the head of public relations for the city was quoted as denying that Brown had oversight over anybody and that &quot;the assistant is more like an [[intern]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME-20050908&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=How Reliable Is Brown's Résumé? |author=Daren Fonda |author2= Rita Healy |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1103003,00.html |newspaper=Time |date=2005-09-08  |accessdate=2009-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Claudia Deakins, the spokesperson for the City of Edmond, submitted information to the House Committee investigating Hurricane Katrina that ''Time Magazine'' had taken her quotes out of context.  ''Time'' erroneously reported Brown's position at the City of Edmond, and the former Mayor of Edmond, Carl Reherman, and the former City Attorney, Mary Ann Karns, each submitted affidavits&lt;ref&gt;[http://katrina.house.gov/hearings/09_27_05/brown092705.pdf House.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; to the House investigating committee showing that Brown did have emergency management experience.

While attending [[law school]], Brown was appointed by the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee of the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] as the Finance Committee Staff Director, where he oversaw state fiscal issues from 1980-1982. In 1981, he was elected to the [[city council]] for Edmond, but resigned to work in private practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Law career==
Later in the 1980s he lived in [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]] and practiced law there. Stephen Jones, the senior partner and founder of the firm, wrote reviews of Brown that he was &quot;an asset to the firm&quot; and described Brown's work as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;first rate,&quot; and &quot;outstanding.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  During the Hurricane Katrina controversy Jones then described him as &quot;not serious and somewhat shallow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME-20050908&quot;/&gt; Of 37 lawyers with Jones' firm, Brown went into solo practice when Jones and his partners decided to split up the firm.

He also taught at [[Oklahoma City University]] law school as an [[Professor#Other positions|adjunct]]. From 1982-1988, he was the Chairman of the Board of the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority.

Brown ran for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in 1988 against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[Glenn English]], who had not been challenged in the previous election. English's well-financed campaign soundly defeated Brown with 122,763 votes against 45,199. After losing, Brown promised to try again in 1990, saying, &quot;I have an excellent chance of prevailing.

Brown and his wife Tamarra have two children.  After leaving federal service they moved to Boulder, Colorado, where they reside.

==IAHA tenure==
Before joining the DHS/FEMA, Brown was the Judges and Stewards Commissioner for the [[International Arabian Horse Association]], (IAHA), from 1989-2001. After numerous [[lawsuit]]s were filed against the organization over disciplinary actions that Brown took against members violating the Association's code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040316034944/http://www.nharab.org/november.htm November 2000 newsletter] from the NHAHA&lt;/ref&gt; Brown resigned and negotiated a buy-out of his contract.

A March 2000 two-part report in the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', chronicling one of the disciplinary actions, lauded Brown for pursuing an investigation against David Boggs, &quot;the kingpin of the Arabian horse world&quot;, despite internal pressure to end the inquiry.&lt;ref name=&quot;brownpush&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20051211032328/http://business.bostonherald.com/businessNews/view.bg?articleid=100857 Brown pushed from last job: Horse group: FEMA chief had to be 'asked to resign'], ''[[Boston Herald]]'', September 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brown-led investigation found Boggs performed medically unnecessary surgery on horses to enhance their visual appeal. An [[ethics]] board suspended Boggs for five years. Boggs protested through multiple lawsuits against both the organization and Brown, alleging [[slander]] and [[defamation]]. Brown and the IAHA prevailed in each of the lawsuits brought by Boggs but the lawsuits nonetheless took a financial toll. Some members interviewed felt Brown showed an imperious attitude, and nicknamed him &quot;The Czar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/news/politics/12554958.htm Head of FEMA has an unlikely background], [[Knight Ridder]], September 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown started his own legal defense fund before resigning, a move he said was necessary to protect his family's assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20011123015525/http://www.ahwmagazine.com/11ahw00/departments/what_world.html What in the World], ''Arabian Horse World'', November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, some IAHA insiders claimed that this was what really led to his ouster. He raised money from [[horse breeding|breeders]] for the fund as well as IAHA, creating what some called a conflict of interest. Despite his contract stipulating that IAHA was to pay all his personal legal expenses, on top of his $100,000 annual salary, the Association refused initially to pay the legal bills, and Brown created the legal defense fund on the advice of IAHA's own legal counsel.

==Bush administration service==
After Bush entered office in January 2001, Brown joined FEMA as [[General Counsel]]. He was the first person hired by his long-time friend, then-FEMA director [[Joe Allbaugh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=FEMA Director Singled Out by Response Critics| title=FEMA Director Singled Out by Response Critics |date=September 6, 2005|accessdate=October 31, 2012|author=Hsu, Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also ran Bush's election campaign in 2000. Allbaugh later named Brown his acting deputy director in September 2001. Bush formally nominated him as deputy director on March 22, 2002, and the Senate confirmed him many months later after the recovery efforts in New York had subsided.  Brown oversaw the recovery efforts for New York and surrounding states with the White House Office of Domestic Policy's [[Reuben Jeffery III]] who later became chairman of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]].  After Bush announced the creation of the Department of Homeland Security Allbaugh left government and Bush nominated Brown again in January 2003 for the directorship. Brown was sworn in to his position on April 15, 2003.  Prior to his nomination as Under Secretary, the White House appointed Brown to head a transition team creating the Emergency Preparedness &amp; Response Directorate within DHS.

Before that, shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], Brown served on the Consequence Management Principals' Committee, which acted as the [[White House]]'s policy coordination group for the federal domestic response to the attacks. Later, Bush asked him to head the Consequence Management Working Group to identify and resolve key issues regarding the federal response plan. In August 2002, Bush appointed him to the Transition Planning Office for the new Department of Homeland Security, serving as the transition leader for the EP&amp;R Division. As undersecretary, Brown also directed the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS) Integration Center, the [[National Disaster Medical System]] and the [[Nuclear Incident Response Team]].

On August 31, 2005, following [[Hurricane Katrina]] being named an &quot;Incident of National Significance&quot;, Brown was named the Principal Federal Official and placed in charge of the federal government's response by [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Director [[Michael Chertoff]]. On September 7, 2005, then [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Chief of Staff [[Vice Admiral]] [[Thad Allen]] was named Brown's deputy and given operational control of [[search and rescue]] and recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/06/AR2005090601677.html?referrer=email Coast Guard's Chief of Staff To Assist FEMA Head Brown], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2005, Chertoff relieved Brown of all on-site relief duties along the [[Gulf Coast]], officially replacing him with then Vice Admiral Allen. Brown remained Under Secretary of Emergency Preparedness and Response. Brown told the [[Associated Press]] that &quot;the press&quot; was making him a [[scapegoat]] for the slow federal response to the hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FEMA chief relieved of Katrina duties |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9266986/ns/us_news-katrina_the_long_road_back/t/fema-chief-relieved-katrina-duties/|date=September 12, 2005|accessdate=October 31, 2012|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2005, Brown announced his resignation as director of FEMA. He commented that the negative publicity surrounding him was distracting attention from the relief effort.

Chertoff granted Brown two 30-day contract extensions in order not to &quot;sacrifice the real ability to get a full picture of Mike's experiences.&quot; Brown continued to receive his $148,000 annual salary until November 2, 2005, when he left in the middle of the second 30-day extension.

===Resignation from FEMA===
On September 12, 2005, in the wake of what was widely believed to be incompetent handling of the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] by state, local and federal officials, Brown resigned, saying that it was &quot;in the best interest of the agency and best interest of the president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9315184/ Career firefighter, ranking FEMA official will replace Mike Brown msnbc, September 13, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; His standing had also been damaged when the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' revealed his meager experience in disaster management before joining FEMA. Shortly after his resignation the [[Associated Press]] obtained a videotape of Brown briefing Bush, Governor Blanco, Mayor Nagin and others in which he questioned the wisdom of the Mayor's use of the Louisiana Superdome as a &quot;shelter of last resort&quot; and questions the structural integrity of the Superdome during the briefing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8umoDbzdlo Youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he resigned from FEMA, Brown had already been discharged from his functions as coordinator of the federal efforts in [[New Orleans]] and [[Gulf Coast]] by Homeland Security Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] and was sent back to Washington to continue FEMA's central operations. Bush, who had appointed Brown in 2003, praised Brown shortly after the storm hit, saying &quot;Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050902-2.html|title=President Arrives in Alabama, Briefed on Hurricane Katrina |publisher=White House|date=September 2, 2005|accessdate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later deflected questions about the resignation, except to deny having discussed the resignation with him.

At least one reliable source, ''[[The Economist]]'', recognized the likelihood that Brown was &quot;pushed&quot; out by the administration rather than having resigned voluntarily, although internal e-mails from Brown indicated that he was already planning to leave FEMA at the time Katrina hit.&lt;!-- broken [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/11/03/national/w094831S76.DTL] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4418260 The pressure on George Bush after Katrina]&lt;/ref&gt; The same suggestion was made by at least one member of Congress during a hearing on what went wrong during Katrina. Brown concentrated his testimony at that hearing on alleging that [[Louisiana]] governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] and New Orleans mayor [[Ray Nagin]] bore most, if not all, of the blame for the failures in the response to Katrina, and that his only fault had been not to realize sooner their inability to perform their respective duties.

After his September 12 resignation, Brown continued working for FEMA as a contractor to help the agency assess what went wrong in the response to the hurricane.

On November 2, 2005, Brown ended his contract early (it had been extended to mid-November by Chertoff) and left the federal government.

On January 18, 2006, Brown stated that certainly things could have been handled differently, such as calling in the military. As one of the largest natural disasters to ever strike the US, he stated, &quot;It was beyond the capacity of the state and local governments, and it was beyond the capacity of FEMA.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2006/01/18/national/w175851S49.DTL Brown Now Says He Deserves Much of Blame, By TOM GARDNER, Associated Press Writer, Wednesday, January 18, 2006]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 2006, Brown again testified before Congress, this time placing blame on the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] for the poor handling of the disaster, asserting that the anti-terrorism focus of the Department had caused it to deny resources needed to FEMA. In his February 2006 testimony, Brown also contradicted earlier claims that the White House was unaware of [[levee]]s having been breached, stating: &quot;For them to claim that we didn't have awareness of it is just baloney.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11255379/ Ex-FEMA chief says he's a scapegoat: ‘I feel somewhat abandoned’, msnbc, February 10, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2006, AP released a recording of Brown and Bush in a video conference in which the vulnerability of the levee system was raised with a great deal of concern over potential loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US Katrina |first= |last= |url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/US-Katrina/208500316b1961ab150d706aa9386cd0?query=michael+brown&amp;current=1&amp;orderBy=Relevance&amp;hits=7&amp;referrer=search&amp;search=%2fsearch%2ffilter%3fquery%3dmichael%2520brown%26startd%3d03%252F01%252F2006%26endd%3d03%252F04%252F2006%26from%3d1%26orderBy%3dRelevance%26allFilters%3d3%252F1%252F2006-3%252F4%252F2006%253ADate%26ptype%3dIncludedProducts%26_%3d1351717857731&amp;allFilters=3%2f1%2f2006-3%2f4%2f2006%3aDate&amp;productType=IncludedProducts|agency=[[Associated Press]] |location=Washington, D.C |id=476847 |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush denied any awareness of the possibility of a levee-related catastrophe in a live interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2005/09/01/BL2005090100915.html A Dearth of Answers, ''Washington Post'', September 1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-FEMA activities==

===Work for InferX Company===
Brown began as an adviser{{When|date=August 2010}} to a publicly traded company, InferX&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070930032955/http://www.inferx.com/brown.htm InferX site bio of Brown],&lt;/ref&gt; which claims its technology is the answer to the U.S.A's security concerns, as well as the credibility problems of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]. Brown has been on the media circuit talking about technology that claims to screen for terror suspects, track threats in shipping containers and cargo hauling, and gather data for law enforcement tracking. In December 2007, Brown was named CEO of [[InferX]] and then appointed to the board of directors in April 2008. As of May 9, 2008 Brown and others left the company pending sale of InferX to another investor.

===Work for Cotton Companies===
{{As of|2007}}, Brown worked for Cotton Companies, a private firm specializing in recovery. Throughout 2007 and early 2008 Brown made appearances to the press on behalf of Cotton companies. In these appearances, he referred to the lessons that he had learned from his experiences as the head of FEMA during Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cottoncompanies.com/press.htm Cotton companies press releases]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio talk show host===
Brown filled in at various times on Denver radio station [[KOA (AM)|KOA]] after leaving government service. In February 2010 he was named the host of the ''Michael Brown Show'' from 7-10 pm weeknights on KOA, when not preempted by sports. Brown has embraced the criticism received during his handling of FEMA and has indicated that this gives him insight into when government fails. In mid-2012 Brown teamed up with Denver liberal KKZN host [[David Sirota]] for [[KHOW]]'s Sirota-Brown show for KHOW's afternoon drive slot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khow.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=391242&amp;article=10241802 |title=Introducing the Sirota - Brown show, afternoons on K-How |publisher=KDVR |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now hosts his own show, again called the ''Michael Brown Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Michael Brown Show|url=http://www.khow.com/pages/michaelbrown.html|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Politically, on the program, Brown describes himself as &quot;very clearly [[center-right]], [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], with a strong [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] bent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Michael |url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2010/01/michael_brownie_brown_on_his_n.php |title=Michael &quot;Brownie&quot; Brown on his new talk-radio gig: &quot;You've got the choice of letting the bus run over you three times... or getting up and moving&quot; - Denver News - The Latest Word |publisher=Blogs.westword.com |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
Brown co-authored a book, ''Deadly Indifference: The Perfect (Political) Storm: Hurricane Katrina, The Bush White House, and Beyond'', about his experiences during Hurricane Katrina. The book was released June 16, 2011 and is published by [[Taylor Trade Publishing]]. Brown criticizes the performance of numerous people, including Bush, [[Trent Lott]], [[Dennis Hastert]], [[Ray Nagin]], and [[Jesse Jackson]], and critiques his own performance by stating that he failed to be ready for the press and was too timid in his response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/06/13/michael-brown-evens-scores-even-if-he-doesnt-mean-to |title=Michael Brown Evens Scores, Even If He Doesn't Mean To - Washington Whispers |publisher=usnews.com |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FEMA controversies and criticism==

===Hurricane Frances===
In 2004, FEMA disbursed $30&amp;nbsp;million in [[disaster relief]] funds for [[Hurricane Frances]] to residents of [[Miami, Florida]], where damage from Hurricane Frances was minimal. Brown admitted to $12&amp;nbsp;million in overpayments, but denied any serious mistakes, blaming a [[computer glitch]]. After investigating, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' wrote that Brown was responsible and called for him to be fired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050911035500/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/editorial/sfl-edittdfemablamesep08,0,4560444.story?coll=sfla-news-editorial FEMA's Disaster], ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'', September 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, U.S. Rep. [[Robert Wexler]] (D-FL) publicly urged Bush to fire Brown, citing the ''Sun-Sentinel'' 's report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050927232506/http://www.wexler.house.gov/news.php?ID=26 Wexler Calls For FEMA Director's Resignation], January 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Wexler repeated his call in April to Chertoff, citing new reports that FEMA sent inspectors with criminal records of [[robbery]] and [[embezzlement]] to do damage assessments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050927232327/http://www.wexler.house.gov/news.php?ID=54 Wexler Renews Call for FEMA Director's Removal], April 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina===
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politicians called for Brown to be fired immediately, including [[California]] Rep. [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Maryland]] Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]], [[New York]] Senators [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] and [[Chuck Schumer]], [[Colorado]] Senator [[Ken Salazar]], [[Michigan]] Rep. [[Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick]] and Senator [[Debbie Stabenow]], [[Louisiana]] State Rep. Peter Sullivan, [[Nevada]] Senator [[Harry Reid]], and [[Illinois]] Senator [[Dick Durbin]].

Republican politicians such as Senator [[Trent Lott]] have also criticized Brown's leadership of FEMA. Brown's performance was defended, however, by Republicans such as former [[New York City]] Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Florida]] Governor [[Jeb Bush]] and former Presidential speechwriter [[Pat Buchanan]]. At the [[Mobile Regional Airport|Mobile (Alabama) Regional Airport]] on September 2, 2005, President Bush publicly praised Brown's handling of the disaster, saying &quot;Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownie&quot;/&gt; &quot;Heck of a job&quot; soon became sarcastic slang for things done by politically connected cronies or general incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/05/AR2005090501590.html FEMA Director Singled Out by Response Critics] ''Washington Post'', September 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO2xi0uLnj8 Video from WhiteHouse.org]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/heck_of_a_job_wolfie/ Heck of a Job, Wolfie] Truthdig.com, April 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2005, five hours after the hurricane hit land, Brown made his first request for Homeland Security rescue workers to be deployed to the disaster area only after two days of training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wid.ap.org/documents/dhskatrina.pdf Memo from Michael Brown to Michael Chertoff], August 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He also told fire and rescue departments outside affected areas to refrain from providing trucks or emergency workers without a direct appeal from state or local governments in order to avoid coordination problems and the accusation of overstepping federal authority.

On September 1, 2005, Brown told [[Soledad O'Brien]] of [[CNN]] that he was unaware that [[New Orleans]]' officials had housed thousands of evacuees, who quickly ran out of food and water, in the Convention Center — even though major news outlets had been reporting on the evacuees' plight for at least a day. He also criticized those that were stuck in New Orleans as those &quot;who chose not to evacuate, who chose not to leave the city&quot; (disobeying a mandatory evacuation order).

On September 2, 2005, [[Chicago]] [[List of mayors of Chicago|Mayor]] [[Richard M. Daley]] stated that he pledged firefighters, police officers, health department workers, and other resources on behalf of the city, but was only asked to send one tank truck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-050902daley,1,2011979.story?coll=chi-news-hed Daley 'shocked' at federal snub of offers to help], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', September 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gail Collins]], at the time [[Managing editor|editor]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[editorial page]], called Michael Brown &quot;legendary as a disaster in his own right&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Gail Collins]] |date=October 2, 2005 |title=A Letter From the Editor: It All Goes on the Permanent Record |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/opinion/02collins.html |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Thanksgiving]] week in 2005, Brown was No. 1 on [[CNN]]'s &quot;Political Turkey of the Year&quot; list for his handling of Katrina.

On August 28, 2007, Democratic presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] proposed what he called &quot;Brownie's Law&quot; requiring that &quot;qualified people, not political hacks&quot;, lead key federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN2721144820070828 Edwards wants law against &quot;Brownies&quot;, Reuters August 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-mails===
Michael Brown's email messages were requested by a congressional house committee in November 2005 to investigate the federal government's handling of the Katrina disaster. Controversy arose when the approximately 1,000 e-mail messages between Brown, staff and acquaintances were released. Several of Michael Brown's emails display an arguable lack of professionalism in his duties (per [[Charlie Melancon]], the representative from this congressional district at the time):&lt;ref name=&quot;caniquitnow&quot;/&gt;

On the day Katrina struck, Brown wrote &quot;Can I quit now? Can I go home?&quot;  He later quipped to a friend on September 2 that he could not meet her because he was &quot;trapped [as FEMA head] ... please rescue me.&quot;; and at another time &quot;If you'll look at my lovely FEMA attire, you'll really vomit. I am a fashion god.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2005/images/11/03/brown.emails.pdf Michael Brown E-mails]&lt;/ref&gt;  In another e-mail, Brown's press secretary, Sharon Worthy, advised him to roll up his sleeves &quot;to look more hard-working... Even the president rolled his sleeves to just below the elbow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;caniquitnow&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/11/03/brown.fema.emails/index.html 'Can I quit now?'

===Deepwater Horizon oil spill===
Michael Brown speaking about the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in May 2010 declared:
:&quot;This is exactly what they want, because now he can pander to the environmentalists and say, 'I'm gonna shut it down because it's too dangerous,'&quot; ... &quot;This president has never supported big oil, he's never supported offshore drilling, and now he has an excuse to shut it back down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/03/michael-brown-obama-wante_n_562004.html HuffingtonPost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Hurricane Sandy]]===
Michael Brown criticized President Obama for responding to Hurricane Sandy faster than he responded to the attacks at Benghazi.

In an interview with Denver [[Westword]], Brown said, &quot;One thing [President Obama's]  gonna be asked is, why did he jump on [Hurricane Sandy] so quickly and go back to D.C. so quickly when in ... Benghazi, he went to Las Vegas? Why was this so quick? ... At some point, somebody's going to ask that question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2012/10/michael_brown_fema_obama_hurricane_sandy.php|title=Michael Brown, ex-FEMA head, has advice, criticism for Obama about Hurricane Sandy|author=Levin, Sam|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=October 31, 2012|publisher=Westword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-move-indef}}
As the center of [[Hurricane Katrina]] passed southeast of [[New Orleans]] on August 29, 2005, winds downtown were in the Category&amp;nbsp;3 range with frequent intense gusts and tidal surge. Hurricane-force winds were experienced throughout the city, although the most severe portion of Katrina missed the city, hitting nearby [[St. Bernard Parish|St. Bernard]] and [[Plaquemines Parish|Plaquemines]] parishes. [[Hurricane Katrina]] made its final landfall in eastern St. Tammany Parish.  The western eye wall passed directly over St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana as a Category 3 hurricane at about 9:45&amp;nbsp;am CST, August 29, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ms-word/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.doc] Richard D. Knabb, Jamie R. Rhome, and Daniel P. Brown, National Hurricane Center, “Tropical Cyclone Report Hurricane Katrina”, August 23–30, 2005; retrieved September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The communities of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], Louisiana, Avery Estates, Lakeshore Estates, Oak Harbor, Eden Isles and Northshore Beach were inundated by the [[storm surge]] that extended over six miles inland.  The storm surge affected all {{convert|57|miles|km}} of St. Tammany Parish’s coastline, including Lacombe, [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] and [[Madisonville, Louisiana|Madisonville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/katrina_la_sttammany.shtm |title=FEMA: Hurricane Katrina Surge Inundation and Advisory Base Flood Elevation Maps |publisher=Fema.gov |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm surge in the area of the Rigolets Pass was estimated to be 16 feet, not including wave action, declining to {{convert|7|ft|m}} at [[Madisonville, Louisiana|Madisonville]]. The surge had a second peak in eastern St. Tammany as the westerly winds from the southern eye wall pushed the surge to the east, backing up at the bottleneck of the Rigolets Pass.

In the City of New Orleans, the storm surge caused more than 50 breaches in drainage canal levees and also in navigational canal levees and precipitated the worst engineering disaster in the history of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;NNSnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.levees.org/research/sources/Newhouse%20A1.htm|title=Human Error Blamed for Making New Orleans' Flooding Worse|author=McQuaid, John; Marshall, Bob; Schleifstein, Mark|year=2005|publisher=Newhouse News Service|accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 31, 2005, 80% of New Orleans was flooded, with some parts under {{convert|15|ft|m}} of water. The famous [[French Quarter]] dodged the massive flooding experienced in other levee areas. Most of the city's levees designed and built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] broke somewhere, including the [[17th Street Canal]] levee, the [[Industrial Canal]] levee, and the [[London Avenue Canal]] floodwall. These breaches were responsible for most of the flooding, according to a June 2007 report by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCE_report&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm|title=External Review of IPET New Orleans Analysis Notes Progress, Yet Risks Remain|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=July 15, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071126174940/http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm |archivedate = November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil refining was stopped in the area, increasing oil prices worldwide.

Between 80 and 90 percent of the residents of New Orleans were evacuated safely in time before the hurricane struck, testifying to some of the success of the evacuation measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolshon|first=Brian|title=Evacuation Planning and Engineering for Hurricane Katrina|journal=The Bridge|year=2006|volume=36|issue=1|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/TheAftermathofKatrina/EvacuationPlanningandEngineeringforHurricaneKatrina.aspx|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The [[Louisiana Superdome]] was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome as a symbol of the flooding occurring in New Orleans.

The disaster had major implications for a large segment of the [[Demographics of the United States|population]], [[Economy of the United States|economy]], and [[Politics of the United States|politics]] of the entire United States. It has prompted a Congressional review of the Corps of Engineers and the failure of portions of the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federally built flood protection]] system which experts agree should have protected the city's inhabitants from Katrina's surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Kilpatrick]] and Sofia Dermisi, &quot;The Aftermath of Katrina: Recommendations for Real Estate Research&quot;, ''Journal of Real Estate Literature'', Spring, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Image:NOLA9thFloodedBetsy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Flooding in the [[Lower Ninth Ward]] of New Orleans after [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965.]]
New Orleans was settled on a natural high ground along the [[Mississippi River]]. Later developments that eventually extended to nearby [[Lake Pontchartrain]] were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into the interior of the city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower drastically. After 1965, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] built a levee system around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp. These factors created [[subsidence]] of up to {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} in some areas due to the consolidation of the underlying organic soils.&lt;ref name=Fischetti&gt;{{Citation |last= Fischetti |first=Mark|title=Drowning New Orleans |journal=Scientific American| volume=285 |issue=4|pages=68–77|date=October 2001|url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=00060286-CB58-1315-8B5883414B7F0000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999–2001 study using [[LIDAR|LIDAR technology]] found that 51% of the terrestrial surface of the contiguous urbanized portions of [[Orleans Parish, Louisiana|Orleans]], [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson]], and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]] parishes lie at or above sea level, with the highest neighborhoods at {{convert|10|–|12|ft|m|1}} above mean sea level, while 49 percent lies below sea level, in places to equivalent depths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams L&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/04/study_bust_myth_that_new_orlea.html|title=Study bust myth that New Orleans is sunken city|last=Williams|first=Leslie|date=April 20, 2007|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, heavy flooding caused by [[Hurricane Betsy]] brought concerns regarding flooding from hurricanes to the forefront. That year Congress passed the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]] which, among other issues, gave authority for design and construction of the flood protection in the [[New Orleans metropolitan area]] to the Corps of Engineers subject to cost sharing principles, some of which were waived by later legislation.  The local municipalities were charged with maintenance once the projects were completed.

When authorized, flood control design and construction were projected to take 13&amp;nbsp;years to complete. When Katrina made landfall in 2005, the project was between 60–90% complete with a projected date of completion estimated for 2015, nearly 50&amp;nbsp;years after it first gained authorization.&lt;ref name=&quot;factcheck.org&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.factcheck.org/article344.html|title=Is Bush to Blame for New Orleans Flooding?|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=[[FactCheck]]|accessdate=June 19, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080512044238/http://www.factcheck.org/article344.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, another major hurricane flooding had long been predicted, and while the close call of [[Hurricane Georges]] in September 1998 galvanized some squabbling scientists, engineers and politicians into collective planning, as at October 2001, ''Scientific American'' declared that &quot;New Orleans is a disaster waiting to happen&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fischetti70&gt;Fischetti, Mark (October 2001), p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2005, flood walls and levees catastrophically failed throughout the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed after a brief period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls — an egregious design flaw.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}&lt;!-- Don't all earthen levees collapse upon overtopping? --&gt; &lt;!-- No, see the article named &quot;Levee Breach&quot; which explains the difference between overtopping and a breach.--&gt;[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] refers to the flooding of New Orleans as the worst engineering disaster in US history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.auburn.edu/admin/marketing/seminars/2007/l-roth.html |title=The New Orleans Levees: The Worst Engineering Catastrophe in US History – What Went Wrong and Why |publisher=Eng.auburn.edu |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-Katrina preparations ==
{{Main|Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans}}
The eye of Hurricane Katrina was forecast to pass to the east of New Orleans. In that event, the wind would come back from the north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from [[Lake Pontchartrain]] against the levees and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach {{convert|14|-|18|ft|m}}, with waves reaching 7&amp;nbsp;feet (2&amp;nbsp;m) above the storm surge.&lt;ref name=&quot;PontchartrainPredictedSurge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.stpgov.org/news/2005/08272005-ContraFlow_1230.html|title=Hurricane Katrina Preparations-Contra Flow Begins at 4&amp;nbsp;pm|work=St. Tammany Parish Government|date=August 27, 2005|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am CDT, the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) field office in New Orleans issued [[National Weather Service bulletin for New Orleans|a bulletin]] predicting catastrophic damage to New Orleans and the surrounding region. Anticipated effects included, at the very least, the partial destruction of half of the well-constructed houses in the city, severe damage to most industrial buildings, rendering them inoperable, the &quot;total destruction&quot; of all wood-framed low-rise apartment buildings, all windows blowing out in high-rise office buildings, and the creation of a huge debris field of trees, telephone poles, cars, and collapsed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Weather Service]]/New Orleans, Louisiana.'' August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of clean water was predicted to &quot;make human suffering incredible by modern standards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Whittell | first = Giles | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,23889-1770245,00.html | title = Warnings were loud and clear—but still city drowned |work=The Times |location=UK | date = September 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also predicted that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render most of the city uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Galle, Julie. &quot;[http://www.weather.com/newscenter/specialreports/hurricanes/vulnerablecities/neworleans.html Special Report: Vulnerable Cities: New Orleans, LA].&quot; ''[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]].''

=== Evacuation order ===
In anticipation of widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina, Max Mayfield, the director of the [[National Hurricane Center]], telephoned New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] on the night of August 27 to express his extreme concern, and on the following day, made a video call to U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] at his farm in [[Crawford, Texas]] about the severity of the storm. 

With the hurricane threatening the Gulf Coast, many New Orleans residents started taking precautions to secure their homes and prepare for possible evacuation on Friday the 26th and Saturday the 27th. By mid morning on the 27th, many local gas stations which were not yet out of gas had long lines. Nagin first called for a voluntary evacuation of the city at 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm on August 27 and subsequently ordered a citywide mandatory evacuation at 9:30&amp;nbsp;am on August 28, the first such order in the city's history. In a live news conference, Mayor Nagin predicted that, &quot;the storm surge most likely will topple our levee system&quot;, and warned that oil production in the Gulf of Mexico would be shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;MandEvac&quot;&gt;Hauser, Christine; Lueck, Thomas J. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/national/29katrinacnd.html Mandatory Evacuation Ordered for New Orleans as Storm Nears].&quot; ''[[New York Times]].'' August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush made a televised appeal for residents to heed the evacuation orders, warning, &quot;We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to Gulf Coast communities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MandEvac&quot;/&gt; Many neighboring areas and parishes also called for evacuations. By mid-afternoon, officials in [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines]], [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]], [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles]], [[Lafourche Parish, Louisiana|Lafourche]], [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne]], [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson]], [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany]], and [[Washington Parish, Louisiana|Washington]] parishes had called for voluntary or mandatory evacuations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Bruce. &quot;[http://www.nola.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1125213007249320.xml?nola Katrina Takes Aim].&quot; ''[[Times-Picayune]].'' August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city, many people refused to leave, which a CNN writer described as &quot;gambling with their own lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/08/28/hurricane.katrina/ New Orleans braces for monster hurricane].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' August 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons were numerous, including a belief that their homes or the buildings in which they planned to stay offered sufficient protection, lack of financial resources or access to transportation, or a feeling of obligation to protect their property. These reasons were complicated by the fact that an evacuation the previous year for [[Hurricane Ivan]] had resulted in the illnesses of many elderly people since cars were stalled in traffic for six to ten hours. The fact that Katrina occurred at the end of the month, before pay checks were in the hands of many was also significant.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Fussell &quot;[http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Fussell/ Leaving New Orleans: Social Stratification, Networks, and Hurricane Evacuation].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;refuge of last resort&quot; was designated at the [[Louisiana Superdome]]. Beginning at noon on August 28 and running for several hours, city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents from 12 pickup points throughout the city to the &quot;shelters of last resort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Lise. &quot;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/3344347.html City had evacuation plan but strayed from strategy].&quot; ''[[Houston Chronicle]].'' September 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Hurricane Katrina came ashore early the next morning, Mayor Nagin estimated that approximately one million people had fled the city and its surrounding suburbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_monsterhurricane&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/08/28/hurricane.katrina/|title=New Orleans braces for monster hurricane|date=August 29, 2005|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the evening of August 28, over 100,000 people remained in the city, with 20,000 taking shelter at the [[Louisiana Superdome]], along with 300 [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_despSOS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4206620.stm|title='Desperate SOS' for New Orleans|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Superdome had been used as a shelter in the past, such as during 1998's [[Hurricane Georges]], because it was estimated to be able to withstand winds of up to {{convert|200|mph|km/h}} and water levels of {{convert|35|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuperdomeShelterHistoryAP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132540,00.html |title=Louisiana Superdome Turns Shelter|agency=Associated Press|date=September 16, 2004|accessdate=July 14, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070530105713/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132540,00.html |archivedate = May 30, 2007 |work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; While supplies of [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MREs]] (Meals ready to eat) and bottled water were available at the Superdome, Nagin told survivors to bring blankets and enough food for several days, warning that it would be a very uncomfortable place. As the elevation of the Superdome is about {{convert|3|ft|m}} above sea level, the forecast storm surge was predicted to cause flooding on that site. Survivors were told to keep out of the lower levels of the structure, for fear it would be flooded. The entire northern Louisiana region was declared a disaster area by the Federal Government before Hurricane Katrina made landfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyReliefEffort&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0830/p01s02-ussc.html|title=Big relief effort meets Katrina|work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=August 30, 2005|first=Kris|last=Axtman|accessdate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

Hurricane Katrina made its second and third landfalls in the Gulf Coast region on August 29, 2005 as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 hurricane]].

On Monday August 29 area affiliates of local television station [[WDSU]] reported New Orleans was experiencing widespread flooding due to several Army Corps-built levee breaches, was without power, and that there were several instances of catastrophic damage in residential and business areas. Entire neighborhoods on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain were flooded.

The extensive flooding stranded many residents, who remained stranded long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were trapped inside attics, unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which residents had been urged to store in their attics in case of such events.&lt;ref name=&quot;failure_initiative&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v058/58.3fleetwood.html#FOOT24|title=Pre-Landfall Preparation and Katrina's Impact|publisher=A Failure of Initiative|pages=73–74|accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.

By 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on August 29, Mayor Nagin described the loss of life as &quot;significant&quot; with reports of bodies floating on the water throughout the city, though primarily in the eastern portions. There was no clean water or electricity in the city, and some hotels and hospitals reported diesel fuel shortages. The [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] began setting up temporary morgues in select locations.

=== Communications failures ===
Coordination of rescue efforts August 29 and August 30 were made difficult by disruption of the communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were not working because of line breaks, destruction of [[Base Transceiver Station|base stations]], or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.

[[Image:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Flooded I-10/I-610 interchange and surrounding area of northwest New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana]]
As of mid-day Monday, August 29, the eye of Hurricane Katrina passed to the East of the City subjecting it to hurricane conditions, but sparing New Orleans the worst impact. The City seemed to have escaped most of the catastrophic wind damage and heavy rain that had been predicted. Most buildings came through well structurally.

[[Image:New Orleans msi 9mar2004 31aug2005-Merge.gif|left|thumb|Satellite photos of New Orleans taken in March 2004, then on August 31, 2005, after the levee failures.]]

The storm surge had severely taxed the city's inadequate levee system built by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] (&quot;MR-GO&quot;) breached its levees in approximately 20 places flooding much of eastern New Orleans, nearly all of [[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard Parish]] and the East Bank of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]]. The major [[levee]] breaches in the city included breaches at the [[17th Street Canal]] [[levee]], the [[London Avenue Canal]], and the wide, navigable [[Industrial Canal]], which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Verity. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4307972.stm Fixing New Orleans' thin gray line].&quot; ''[[BBC News]].'' October 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There were three major breaches at the [[Industrial Canal]]; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the [[Lower Ninth Ward]], between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The [[17th Street Canal]] [[levee]] was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the [[London Avenue Canal]] breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put the majority of the city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.

In a June 2006 report on the disaster,&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmyCorpsJune2006Report&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20060601_ARMYCORPS_SUMM.pdf|title=Performance Evaluation of the New Orleans and Southeast Louisiana Hurricane Protection System|work=The US Army Corps of Engineers|date=June 1, 2006|accessdate=June 25, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections, and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to the damage done to New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTArmyCorpsFlaws&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/us/01cnd-corps.html?ex=1182052800&amp;en=93ef872cf24431bc&amp;ei=5070|title=Army Corps Admits Flaws in New Orleans Levees|work=The New York Times|date=June 1, 2006|first=John|last=Schwartz|accessdate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in June 2007 concluded that two-thirds of the flooding in the city could have been avoided if the levees had held.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCE ERP report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/ERPreport.pdf|title=The New Orleans Hurricane Protection System: What Went Wrong and Why|work=American Society of Civil Engineers|date=June 4, 2007|accessdate=June 25, 2008|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624204644/http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/ERPreport.pdf |archivedate = June 24, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans]] has prompted many government officials to call for hearings, committees and investigations, including a call for an 8/29 Commission to investigate both the engineering and decision-making behind the collapse of a flood protection system that should have held against Katrina's storm surge.&lt;ref name=&quot;9-11PanelRequest&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501233.html|title=Group Wants 9-11-Style Panel on Levees|work=The Associated Press|date=February 5, 2005|first=Cain|last=Burdeau|accessdate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aerial view of SFNO after Hurricane Katrina.jpg|right|thumb|[[Six Flags New Orleans]] still flooded 2 weeks after the levee failures]]

'''Six Flags New Orleans''', a amusement park, was one of the places flooded due to the levee failures. However, it was abandoned after being critically damaged and flooded 2 weeks due to the [[Hurricane Katrina]] levee failure disasters. It caused the rides and attractions to shut down and remain [[Standing but not operating|SBNO]]. [[Batman: The Ride]], a inverted roller coaster that is found at many [[Six Flags]] amusement parks, stood SBNO until the 2007 season and Six Flags began removing the roller coaster from the park. [[Zydeco Scream]], [[The Jester (roller coaster)|The Jester]], [[Mega Zeph]], and [[Muskrat Scrambler]] all remain SBNO at the park.

Later studies determined that most of New Orleans' Katrina dead were elderly persons living near levee breaches in the 9th Ward and Lakeview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/answers_are_scarce_in_study_of.html|title=Study of Hurricane Katrina's dead show most were old, lived near levee breaches|last=Schleifstein|first=Mark |date=August 27, 2009|publisher=The Times-Picayune|accessdate=August 29, 2009}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.

There were six deaths confirmed at the Superdome. Four of these were from natural causes, one was the result of a drug overdose, and one was a suicide. At the Convention Center, four bodies were recovered.

=== Civil disturbances ===
[[Image:New Orleans Fire 2005-09-02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A fire raged in a downtown business the morning of September 2.]]
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, [[looting]], violence and other [[crime|criminal activity]] became serious problems. With most of the attention of the authorities focused on rescue efforts, public security in New Orleans degraded quickly. By August 30, looting had spread throughout the city, often in broad daylight and in the presence of police officers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

&quot;[[Sniper]] fire&quot; was also reported throughout the city, targeted at rescue helicopters, relief workers, and police officers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Looting and &quot;mayhem&quot; was also hampering efforts to evacuate the [[Tulane Medical Center]], as well. &quot;If we do not have the federal presence in New Orleans tonight at dark, it will no longer be safe to be there, hospital or no hospital,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZuschlagCNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/08/31/katrina.hospitals/index.html|title=Mayhem hampering hospital evacuations|work=CNN|date=August 31, 2005|accessdate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acadian Ambulance]] Services C.E.O.

Some initial reports of mass chaos, particularly in stories about the Superdome, were later found to be exaggerated or rumor.&lt;ref name=&quot;FearExceededCrime&quot;/&gt; In the Superdome for example, the New Orleans sex crimes unit investigated every report of rape or atrocity and found only two verifiable incidents, both of sexual assault. The department head told reporters, &quot;I think it was urban myth. Any time you put 25,000&amp;nbsp;people under one roof, with no running water, no electricity and no information, stories get told.&quot; Based on these reports, government officials expected hundreds of dead to be found in the Superdome, but instead found only 6 dead (of which there were 4 natural deaths, one drug overdose and one suicide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/aug/26/katrina-racism-us-media |title=Four years on, Katrina remains cursed by rumour, cliche, lies and racism |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=December 26, 2011 |first=Rebecca |last=Solnit |date=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thevenot, Brian and Russell, Gordon &quot;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002520986_katmyth26.html Seattle Times: Reports of anarchy at Superdome overstated]&quot; September 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of reported sniper fire, the &quot;sniper&quot; turned out to be the relief valve of a gas tank popping every few minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;FearExceededCrime&quot;/&gt;

At the time of the hurricane there were some 400 priests and 750 nuns in the [[Archdiocese of New Orleans]], many stationed in the city. While most elderly and infirm clergy and nuns were evacuated, many others refused to leave, even when a general evacuation was ordered.

The City of [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]] on the West Bank of the Mississippi River received considerable press coverage when, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (late August 2005), displaced and dehydrated survivors who attempted to escape from New Orleans by walking over the [[Crescent City Connection]] bridge over the Mississippi River were turned back at gunpoint by City of Gretna Police, along with Crescent City Connection Police and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's deputies, who set up a [[roadblock]] on the bridge in the days following the hurricane.

On August 31, New Orleans's 1,500-member police force was ordered to abandon search and rescue missions and turn its attention toward controlling the widespread looting. The city also ordered a mandatory curfew. Mayor Nagin called for increased federal assistance in a &quot;desperate S.O.S.&quot;, following the city's inability to control looting. He was often misquoted as declaring &quot;[[martial law]]&quot; in the city, despite there being no such term in Louisiana state law (a declaration of a [[state of emergency]] was instead made).&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Justin. &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/katrina/story/0,16441,1561314,00.html Mayor issues SOS as chaos tightens its grip].&quot; ''[[The Guardian]].''

August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As conditions worsened and flood waters continued to rise, on August 31, Governor Blanco ordered that all of New Orleans, including the Superdome, be evacuated. The area outside the Superdome was flooded to a depth of {{convert|3|ft|m}}, with a possibility of {{convert|7|ft|m}} if the area equalized with Lake Pontchartrain. Governor Blanco had the state send in 68 school buses on Monday to begin evacuating people.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ed. &quot;[http://www.nola.com/weblogs/print.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_Times-Picayune/archives/print075816.html School buses used to evacuate].&quot; ''[[Times-Picayune]].'' September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite increasingly squalid conditions, the population inside continued to grow. The situation inside the building was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 were reported to have died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britons describe hurricane ordeal&quot;/&gt; Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;thevenot&quot;/&gt;

FEMA had announced that, in conjunction with [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], the National Guard, and [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas|Houston Metro]], the 25,000&amp;nbsp;people at the Superdome would be relocated across state lines to the [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ThomasF&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-31-astrodome_x.htm|title=Astrodome to become new home for storm refugees|last=Frank|first=Thomas|date=August 31, 2005|work=USA Today|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 475 buses were promised by FEMA to ferry evacuees with the entire evacuation expected to take two days.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ed; Moller, Jan. &quot;[http://www.nola.com/newslogs/breakingtp/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_Times-Picayune/archives/2005_08.html#075422 Update on Superdome Evacuation].&quot; ''[[Times-Picayune]].'' August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; By September 4, the Superdome had been completely evacuated.

Although the Superdome suffered damage by water and wind to the overall interior and exterior structures, as well as interior damage from human waste and trash, the facility was repaired at a cost of US$140&amp;nbsp;million and was ready for games by the autumn of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=6&amp;nid=3740 NFL, at Saints' urging, kicks in $20 million for dome repairs].&quot; ''KCEN-TV.'' January 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Orleans Saints|Saints']] first game in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina was played on September 25, 2006 (the third [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] of the regular season), resulting in a 23–3 Saints victory over the [[Atlanta Falcons]].

=== New Orleans Convention Center ===
Because of Hurricane Katrina, the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]] suffered a loss of water pressure and electricity, and one of its convention halls had a large hole in its ceiling. The center was otherwise only lightly damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost_haygood&quot;&gt;Haygood, Wil and Tyson, Ann Scott. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/14/AR2005091402655.html It Was as if All of Us Were Already Pronounced Dead]&quot;. ''[[Washington Post]].'' September 15, 2005. Retrieved on November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, as people were being turned away at the Superdome and rescues continued, rescuers began dropping people off at the Convention Center, which, at {{convert|8|ft|m|0}} above sea level, easily escaped the flood. Captain M.A. Pfeiffer of the [[NOPD]] was quoted as saying, &quot;It was supposed to be a bus stop where they dropped people off for transportation. The problem was, the transportation never came.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost_haygood&quot;/&gt; By the afternoon of the 29th, the crowd had grown to about 1,000&amp;nbsp;people. The convention center's president (who was there with a small group of convention center employees at this time) addressed the crowd near dark, informing them that there was no food, water, medical care, or other services. By late on the evening of the 29th, the convention center had been broken into, and evacuees began occupying the inside of the convention center.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost_haygood&quot;/&gt;

A contingent of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied one part of the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost_haygood&quot;/&gt; The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianConventionCenter&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/sep/03/hurricanekatrina.usa6|title=It reminds me of Baghdad in the worst of times|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=September 3, 2005|first=Julian|last=Borger|accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, Alec. &quot;[http://www.wdsu.com/news/5627087/detail.html 40 Rapes Reported in Hurricane Katrina, Rita Aftermath].&quot; ''[[WDSU]].'' December 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, John. &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5063796 More Stories Emerge of Rapes in Post-Katrina Chaos].&quot; ''[[National Public Radio]].'' December 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, did not have their bodies moved or removed and were left to decompose.

By September 1, the facility, like the Superdome, was completely overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, even though there were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head [[Michael D. Brown|Michael Brown]] and Homeland Security Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] both claimed to have no knowledge of the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/02/katrina.response/ The big disconnect on New Orleans].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable contingent of National Guard arrived on September 2 to establish order and provide essential provisions, and on September 3, buses began arriving at the convention center to pick up the refugees there.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost_haygood&quot;/&gt; The Convention Center was completely evacuated by September 4.

=== Evacuation efforts ===
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina Highway Evacuees.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hurricane evacuees in [[Metairie, Louisiana]], being helped by the US Air National Guard on September 3.]]

On August 31, a public health emergency was declared for the entire Gulf Coast, and [[Louisiana]] Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] ordered a mandatory evacuation of all those remaining in New Orleans. Relief organizations scrambled to locate suitable areas for relocating evacuees on a large scale. Many of the survivors in the Superdome were bussed to the [[Reliant Astrodome]] in [[Houston]], Texas. Houston agreed to shelter an additional 25,000 evacuees beyond those admitted to the Astrodome, including one &quot;renegade bus&quot; that was commandeered by private citizen [[Jabbar Gibson]], who had been released on bond from the Orleans Parish Prison just days before the storm hit, and had a previous criminal conviction. By September 1, the Astrodome was declared full and could not accept any more evacuees. The [[George R. Brown Convention Center]] nearby was opened to house additional evacuees. [[San Antonio]], Texas also agreed to house 25,000 refugees, beginning relocation efforts in vacant office buildings on the grounds of [[KellyUSA]], a former air force base, and [[Reunion Arena]] in [[Dallas]], Texas was mobilized to house incoming evacuees, and smaller shelters were established in towns across Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. [[Arkansas]] also opened various shelters and state parks throughout the state for evacuees.

Expected to last only two days, the evacuation of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure and a growing number of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.

Evacuation efforts were hastened on September 2 by the wider dispersal of evacuees among newly-opened shelters. [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|Louis Armstrong International Airport]] was reopened to allow flights related to relief efforts, and began to load evacuees onto planes as well.

Elements of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] arrived in New Orleans September 3. The flooding was a challenge for the paratroopers when they first arrived. The division had just four boats at the time, however, the division quickly started getting Coast Guard, Navy and Marine assets placed under their control. Army Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the 82nd's commanding general, noted: &quot;We eventually became the 82nd 'Waterborne' Division,&quot; the general said, &quot;and that really was our forte&quot; during search-and-rescue and security missions in flooded sections of the city.
[[File:FEMA - 17281 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 08-30-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Rescue teams evacuating residents from flooded areas.]]
Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore also charged the paratroopers to straighten out the evacuation situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New Orleans to participate in Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352&amp;nbsp;people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry J. Gilmore, American Forces Press Service. &quot;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=17253/82nd Airborne Division Becomes Waterborne in New Orleans].&quot;Retrieved on July 18, 2008. {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, some 42,000 evacuees were evacuated from New Orleans, including those remaining in the Superdome and Convention Center. Efforts turned to the hundreds of people still trapped in area hotels, hospitals, schools and private homes.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/04/katrina.impact/index.html House-to-house rescues under way in New Orleans].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a forced evacuation of everyone from the city who was not involved in clean up work, citing safety and health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/06/katrina.impact/index.html New Orleans will force evacuations].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order, but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Timothy; Tyson, Ann Scott. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/08/AR2005090802089.html Troops Escalate Urgency of Evacuation].&quot; ''[[Washington Post]].''

=== Health effects ===
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina Medical Evacuees.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sick and injured people being evacuated aboard a [[C-17 Globemaster III]]]]
There was a concern that the prolonged flooding would lead to an outbreak of health problems for those who remained in the city. In addition to [[dehydration]] and [[food poisoning]], there was also potential for the spread of [[hepatitis A]], [[cholera]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[typhoid fever]], all related to the growing contamination of food and drinking water supplies in the city compounded by the city's characteristic heat and stifling humidity.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/331/7522/970|title=Book Review: Disease and Democracy: The Industrialised World Faces AIDS|work=British Medical Journal|date=October 22, 2005|first=Jennifer P.|last= Ruger|accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Survivors could also face long-term health risks due to prolonged exposure to the petrochemical tainted flood waters and mosquito-borne diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[malaria]] and [[West Nile Virus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gauginghealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/hurricane/dn7959-gauging-the-health-crisis-in-katrinas-wake.html|title=Gauging the health crisis in Katrina’s wake|work=New Scientist|date=September 6, 2005|first=Gaia|last=Vince|accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACSPetroleum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/83/i38/8338pollutants.html|title=Katrina's Aftermath: Petroleum, Bacteria Are Primary Pollutants|work=American Chemical Society|date=September 19, 2005|first=Cherly|last=Hogue|accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, an emergency [[triage]] center was set up at the airport. A steady stream of helicopters and ambulances brought in the elderly, sick, and injured. Baggage equipment was used as gurneys to transport people from the flight line to the hospital, which was set up in the airport terminal. The scene could be described as, &quot;organized chaos&quot;, but efficient. By September 3, the situation started to stabilize. Up to 5,000 people had been [[triage]]d and fewer than 200 remained at the medical unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;APDeadDying&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wwltv.com/sharedcontent/nationworld/katrina/stories/090305ccKatrinajrwcMainstory.1f76bb86.html|title=New Orleans left to the dead and dying|agency=Associated Press|date=September 4, 2005|first=Allen G.|last=Breed|accessdate=June 20, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061231195216/http://www.wwltv.com/sharedcontent/nationworld/katrina/stories/090305ccKatrinajrwcMainstory.1f76bb86.html |archivedate = December 31, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospital evacuations continued from other area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the [[Methodist]] Hospital indicated that people were dying of dehydration and exhaustion while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The first floor of the hospital flooded and the dead were stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags.

Among the many hospitals shut down by damage related to the hurricane was the public hospital serving New Orleans, [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]], which was also the only trauma center serving that region. The destruction of the hospital's structure has forced the continued closure as funding for a new building is sought out.

On September 6, ''[[E. coli]]'' was detected in the water supply. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], five people died from bacterial infections caused by the toxic waters. The deaths appear to have been caused by ''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]'' bacteria, of the [[Cholera]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/09/07/MTFH64451_2005-09-07_18-34-52_YUE762791.html The latest on Katrina's aftermaths].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===

Prior to Katrina’s landfall in 2005, the economy of New Orleans relied heavily on its usefulness and income derived from being a port city. The population grew and the economy peaked in the late 19th century. However, in the recent years, after rapid industrialization and the development of faster methods of transporting goods, the economy of New Orleans has been in a steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Vigdor, Jacob, &quot;The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,&quot; 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 135–138.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, New Orleans came to rely on three major industries for economic revenue:  transportation, entertainment, and public services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vigdor&quot;&gt;Vigdor, Jacob, &quot;The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,&quot; 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 141.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Katrina’s landfall, these sectors, including the overall economy, were reduced and heavily affected by the natural disaster.

After the hurricane, the labor force diminished and wages decreased by staggering amounts. In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vigdor&quot;&gt;Vigdor, Jacob, &quot;The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,&quot; 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high demand to make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vigdor&quot;/&gt;

In the first initial months following Katrina, the labor force reduced faster than the demand and unemployment rates skyrocketed. However, as of September 2006, the unemployment rates have never fallen below national average, indicating improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vigdor&quot;&gt;Vigdor, Jacob, &quot;The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,&quot; 'The Journal of Economic Perspective' 22 (2008): 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second quarters of both 2005 and 2007, the firms' wages were increased by 21%, twice more than national increases, indicating even further improvement, although the gains were varied across the sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vigdor&quot;&gt;Vigdor, Jacob, &quot;The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,&quot; 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some suggestions concerning the usage of natural capital in order to further aid New Orleans’ economy. One such is that, as opposed to rebuilding on flooded lands, restoring acres of wetlands to profit from the economic wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costanza&quot;/&gt; The [[Mississippi delta]] provides the United States with one of the largest fisheries and the most important [[flyway]] terminus, enabling New Orleans to profit from these ecological industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costanza&quot;&gt;Costanza, Robert, et al, &quot;A New Vision for New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta: Applying Ecological Economics and Ecological Engineering,&quot; 'Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment' 4 (2006): 470&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by increasing the wetlands, it would help create a natural barrier that could aid New Orleans in future storms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costanza&quot;&gt;DETAILS OF REF&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that if New Orleans were to restore {{convert|1700|sqmi|sqkm}} of wetland lost prior to 2005, the natural capital would be worth an estimated $6 billion/year, or $200 billion at the present value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costanza&quot;&gt;DETAILS OF REF&lt;/ref&gt; While New Orleans has made numerous efforts in rebuilding their economy, and has been successful with tourist-attracting events such as [[Mardi Gras]], the natural capital provided could further assist the city in returning to its pre-Katrina wealth and economy.

More than 1&amp;nbsp;million customers were left without [[electricity]], and damage in Florida was estimated at between [[United States Dollar|$]]1 and $2&amp;nbsp;billion (with most of the damage coming from flooding and overturned trees).

Two&amp;nbsp;traffic fatalities related to Katrina were also reported on the [[Florida Panhandle]] in [[Walton County, Florida|Walton County]], and moderate to locally heavy damage was reported in the western part of the Panhandle (on the outer edge of Katrina), which had already been hit hard by [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004 and [[Hurricane Dennis]] in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.wtvynews4.com/home/headlines/1705326.html Fatal Accident on I-10].&quot; ''[[WTVY (TV)|WTVY]].''

==Louisiana==
Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana at 6:45 AM local time on August 29, 2005, as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] hurricane with sustained winds of {{convert|127|mph|km/h}}, near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]] and a 22-foot storm surge. The eye of the storm passed 27 miles east of downtown New Orleans at 8:30 AM. The primary areas that were affected were southeastern [[Louisiana]], including the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the parishes of [[St. Tammany, Louisiana|St. Tammany]] (Slidell), [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson]] (Gretna), [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne]] (Houma), [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines]] (Buras), [[Lafourche Parish|Lafourche]] (Thibodaux), and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]] (Chalmette).

According to officials nearly one million people were temporarily without electricity in Louisiana for several weeks. On September 1, 2005, 800,000 homes were without electricity. Numerous roadways were flooded or damaged and many evacuations conducted by boat and helicopter.

Approximately 46,000 [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] were dispatched to the area as part of the disaster relief effort. The [[United States Navy]] also announced that four amphibious ships would be sent from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] within a few days to assist the relief efforts. The US Coast Guard rescued 1,259 survivors off rooftops by Wednesday morning August 31, less than two days after landfall, and more than 1,000 the next day. In less than two weeks 12,535 flood victims were saved by helicopter. In all, the Coast Guard made 33,544 rescues by helicopter and boats. &quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uscg.mil&quot;&gt;http://www.uscg.mil/history/katrina/DarkestDay.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 1, 2006, when new population estimates were calculated by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the population of the state of Louisiana declined by 219,563, or 4.87%.&lt;ref name=&quot;popdecline&quot;&gt;Christie, Les. &quot;[http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/22/real_estate/fastest_growing_states/index.htm?postversion=2006122209 Growth states: Arizona overtakes Nevada: Texas adds most people overall; Louisiana population declines nearly 5%].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' December 22, 2006. Retrieved on December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as matters were beginning to improve in 2010, the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in the Gulf in April 2010 caused massive amounts of oil to come ashore in the wetlands and marshes in [[Plaquemines Parish]] and other areas of coastal Louisiana near New Orleans that had been most heavily damaged by Katrina- and the spill will likely reach other states that were also affected by the storm (the hurricane had caused or exacerbated oil spills on a smaller scale when it hit).

===New Orleans===
[[Image:Navy-FloodedNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An aerial view of the flooding near downtown New Orleans. The [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] is at center.]]
{{main|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans}}
Although [[Mayor]] [[Ray Nagin]] did not order a mandatory evacuation of the city until August 28, 2005, many did not evacuate because the mayor had said, ''If you want to leave you can''.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/08/28/hurricane.katrina/ New Orleans braces for monster hurricane].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' August 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one million people had fled the city and its surrounding suburbs by the evening of August 28, while about 100,000&amp;nbsp;people remained in the city, with about 10,000 taking shelter at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] which had been prepared to accommodate only 800 - eventually 30,000 arrived at the Superdome before they were evacuated.

By August 31, eighty percent (80%) of the city of New Orleans was flooded by Hurricane Katrina, with some parts of the city under {{convert|20|ft|m}}, of water. Over 50 breaches in region's levee system were catalogued, five of which resulted in massive flooding of New Orleans. The [[17th Street Canal]] levee was just south of the Hammond Highway Bridge. Levees adjacent to London Avenue breached in two locations, one near Robert E. Lee Boulevard and one between Filmore Avenue and Mirabeau Avenue. Two breaches also occurred in the Industrial Canal adjacent to Surekote Road. Levee repair efforts were undertaken, involving reinforcing the levees with {{convert|3000|lb|kg}}, sandbags deployed by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] and [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters. The 17th Street Canal levee repair was completed by September 5, 2005 and the three canals have been repaired into Lake Pontchartrain ever since it had flooded but, they still added flood gates that were installed by the Army Corps of Engineers.

Many evacuees were trapped in flooded houses and rooftops waiting to be rescued. The Superdome sustained significant damage and much of the dome's waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off. On August 30, Louisiana governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] ordered the complete evacuation of the remaining people that sought shelter in the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USAtodaybleak&quot;&gt;Rourke, Matt. &quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-30-katrina_x.htm New Orleans outlook bleak; 100 dead in Miss.]&quot; ''[[USA Today]].'' August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Blanco instructed the Adjutant General of the Louisiana National Guard, [[Bennett C. Landreneau|Major General Bennett C. Landreneau]] to contact Honoré of Northern Command (Honoré arrived on Wednesday, August 31, as the commander of the newly established Joint Task Force Katrina to supervise federal military operations) to arrange for active duty military support of response operations in Louisiana. General Landreneau instructed Louisiana National Guard officials at the Superdome to cease planning for the evacuation as Honoré would be “taking charge” of the evacuation project. The evacuees were then transported to the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. The only route out of the city was west on the Crescent City Connection as the [[Interstate 10|I-10]] (twin span) bridge traveling east towards [[Slidell, Louisiana]] had collapsed. The [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] was also carrying emergency traffic only.

===St. Tammany Parish===
[[Hurricane Katrina]] made its final landfall in eastern St. Tammany Parish. The western eye wall passed directly over St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana as a Category 3 hurricane at about 9:45 AM CST, August 29, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ms-word/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.doc] Richard D. Knabb, Jamie R. Rhome, and Daniel P. Brown, National Hurricane Center, “Tropical Cyclone Report Hurricane Katrina”, 23–30 August 2005; retrieved September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;   The communities of Slidell, Avery Estates, Lakeshore Estates, Oak Harbor, Eden Isles and Northshore Beach were inundated by the storm surge that extended over six miles inland. The storm surge impacted all 57 miles of St. Tammany Parish’s coastline, including Lacombe, [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] and [[Madisonville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/katrina_la_sttammany.shtm]&lt;/ref&gt; The storm surge in the area of the Rigolets Pass is estimated 16 feet, not including wave action declining to 7 feet at [[Madisonville]]. The surge had a second peak in eastern St. Tammany as the westerly winds from the southern eye wall pushed the surge to the east, backing up at the bottleneck of the Rigolets Pass.
The Twin Spans of I-10 between Slidell and New Orleans East were virtually destroyed, and much of I-10 in New Orleans East was under water. The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway and the Highway 11 bridge, connecting the north and south shores of Lake Pontchartrain, were open only to emergency traffic. 
Initial search and rescue operations were conducted south of Highway 190 from Lacombe east to the state line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stpgov.org/news/2005/TuesdayAug30_9am.html] St. Tammany Parish Emergency Operations Center Parish Status Update, Tuesday, August 30, 2005 9:00 AM; retrieved September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;   Fire District No. 1 and the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s office evacuated over 3,000 people from flooded homes and rescued about 300 people in imminent danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stpgov.org/news/2005/10272005-StateoftheParish.html]&quot;State of the Parish&quot; Speech, October 27, 2005, St. Tammany Parish President Kevin Davis; retrieved September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Radio communications among first responders functioned throughout the rescue period but the 9-1-1 system was not operational for ten days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stpgov.org/news/2005/09082005 pedro rox my sox all the way off !_Thur_5PM_status_update.html] St. Tammany Parish Emergency Operations Center Parish Status Update, Thursday, September 8, 2005 5:00 PM; Retrieved September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
Utility services were not available anywhere in the parish. Generator power was available for hospitals and a special needs shelter. Hospitals were running at capacity on generator power. 
The hurricane force winds toppled trees and telephone poles parish-wide, blocking all transportation routes.   Land debris clean up continued into 2007 with over 6.6 million cubic yards collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stpgov.org/pdf/1179167900.pdf]&quot;State of the Parish&quot; Speech, October 27, 2005, St. Tammany Parish President Kevin Davis; retrieved September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Debris cleaning in waterways continued at least through 2009.
Hurricane Katrina damaged 48,792 housing units in St. Tammany Parish from flood waters, high winds, or both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/GulfCoast_HousingDamageEstimates_021206.pdf]&quot;Current Housing Unit Damage Estimates, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma&quot;, February 12, 2006, Analysis by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Policy Development and Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jefferson Parish===
The breach on the east side of the [[17th Street Canal]] levee did not cause severe flooding within [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], but some lower lying areas did receive significant water damage, especially on the East Bank.

The Sheriff of [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] reported that he expected his district to remain uninhabitable for at least one week and that residents should not return to the area. Incidents of [[looting]] have been reported throughout affected areas of Louisiana, most notably in New Orleans. Louisiana governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] ordered all roadways into the state closed.

By one week after the storm, residents were allowed to return to their homes to retrieve essentials, provided that they could present identification proving that they lived in the parish. They were only allowed in to retrieve essential items, and were then required to leave the parish for another month.

===Terrebonne Parish===
In [[Terrebonne Parish]], signs, trees, roofs and utility poles suffered the brunt of Hurricane Katrina's fury when the storm roared across Terrebonne and [[Lafourche Parish|Lafourche]]. Most of Terrebonne Parish and Lafourche Parish were covered with water during the storm surge, yet Houma was spared to the extent that the Coast Guard used their airport for the initial rescue launch site. &quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uscg.mil&quot;/&gt;

===Plaquemines Parish===
[[Image:PostVeniceLG.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Flooding in [[Venice, Louisiana]].]]
Hurricane Katrina made a direct landfall in the &quot;lower&quot; (southern/down river) portion of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana]], the eye passed directly over the town of [[Empire, Louisiana]]. There was extensive flooding the majority of the Parish, and the southern part was temporarily &quot;reclaimed&quot; by the [[Mississippi River]]. All of the East Bank of the Parish was flooded, as was the downriver portion of the West Bank. Belle Chase mostly escaped with only moderate wind damage.

The Belle Chasse Tunnel was flooded as well.

On August 29, the President of Plaquemines Parish, Benny Rousselle, issued a statement to all residents not to return to the parish until further notice. There were no public services available and all roads were closed and impassable. He requested that only employees in Drainage, Heavy Equipment, Public Right-of-Way Maintenance and Solid Waste Departments return to the parish if possible.

Areas gradually opened up in late 2005.

===St. Bernard Parish===
[[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]], which lies to the East of New Orleans and thus was closer to the path of the storm and the more exposed to the storm surge from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], was completely flooded via water surging into Lake Borgne. A large portion of the flooding was apparently the result of levee failures along the [[Mississippi River – Gulf Outlet Canal]], a {{convert|76|mi|km}} canal. The levees were sized to hold back up to {{convert|17.5|ft|m}}, of water: they held back the initial surge, but then they were breached in several areas by the {{convert|22|ft|m}}, surge. 

The Parish's two shelters at Chalmette High School and St. Bernard High School suffered considerable damage with flooding. Chalmette High lost much of its roof, and St. Bernard High had many broken windows. There were estimates of 300-plus evacuees at both sites.

By August 29, about 150&amp;nbsp;people were sighted on rooftops in areas that were under approximately 8–10&amp;nbsp;feet or more of water. Among those on the roofs were [[WDSU]] reporter Heath Allen and a St. Bernard resident on a Government Complex rooftop. Residents reported that even oil platform service boats were utilized to rescue survivors.

Several tragic deaths were reported at St. Rita's Nursing Home in the parish, as 34&amp;nbsp;people died due to drowning. The owners of the nursing home were arrested and charged with negligent homicide for not having evacuated in advance of the storm. The owners were subsequently found not guilty September 7, 2007 &quot;&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyID=14248787&amp;ft=2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Parish===
[[Washington Parish, Louisiana]] is located north of New Orleans. The parish received significant damage due to wind damage and local flooding. The Parish is home to many pine forests in which many of the pine trees snapped or were completely uprooted. The eye of Katrina could be seen from the eastern part of the parish, in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]] as Bogalusa was only fifteen miles away from the center of the eye. Much of Bogalusa was without power for weeks. Many major roads were covered by trees and were not cleared for many days. Schools did not open until October. As gasoline was in short supply even for emergency workers, the parish banned gas to the public for several days, arousing ire of many locals.

==Mississippi==

[[Image:Mississippi counties Katrina disaster areas map.png|thumb|280px|right| '''Mississippi''' (all counties disaster areas): 49 lower with full assistance, green have only public assistance Category A/B.]]

Hurricane Katrina's devastating impact on the state of [[Mississippi]] caused a complete re-evaluation of hurricane command centers, safety, and offshore gambling. Because landfall was during daylight, many people survived by swimming to higher buildings and trees within sight. Afterward, all Mississippi counties were declared disaster areas (see map).

The Gulf Coast of Mississippi suffered massive damage from the impact of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, leaving 238&amp;nbsp;people dead, 67 missing, and an estimated $125&amp;nbsp;billion in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.sunherald.com/2005/12/14/2416342/mississippis-invisible-coast.html].&quot; ''[[Sun Herald]].'' December 14, 2005.'''&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;/ref&gt; Since Katrina made its third and final landfall on the Louisiana/Mississippi state line, the storm's powerful northeastern quadrant hammered areas of Mississippi, as well as [[Alabama]], causing extensive wind and flood damage. According to [[MSNBC]], a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} storm surge came ashore wiping out 90% of the buildings along the [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]-[[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] coastline. The bridge between [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]] and [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]] was also damaged by the storm.

The three counties most affected by the storm were the coastal counties, [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison County]], and [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]]. Emergency command centers in the 3 coastal counties were partially disabled, prompting a re-evaluation of general hurricane emergency-center design nationwide: in Hancock county, the emergency-command headquarters were swamped by a 32-foot (11-m) storm tide flooding into the building, which had been considered flood-proof at {{convert|30|ft|m}} above sea level.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) officials also recorded deaths in [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds]], [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren]], and [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake]] counties. About 800,000&amp;nbsp;people through the state experienced power outages, which is almost a third of the population.

[[United States Navy]] officials announced that two [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] [[guided missile]] [[destroyer]]s that were under construction at [[Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] had been damaged by the storm, as well as the [[Amphibious assault ship]] {{USS|Makin Island|LHD-8|6}}.

===Hancock County===
[[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]] was the scene of the final landfall of the eye of Hurricane Katrina, and its communities and infrastructure suffered some of the most intense damage inflicted by that storm. Devastation occurred in many communities, including [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]], [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]], and [[Clermont Harbor, Mississippi|Clermont Harbor]].

Katrina practically obliterated Waveland, and state officials said that it took a harder hit from the wind and water than any other town along the coast. The storm dragged away almost every structure within one half mile of the beach, leaving driveways and walkways that went to nowhere.&lt;ref&gt;Burdeau, Cain. &quot;[http://www.wwltv.com/topstories/stories/wwl083105waveland.11adc324.html Waveland practically wiped off map by force of Katrina].&quot; ''[[WWL-TV]].'' August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The death toll was estimated at about 50.

In Bay St. Louis, Katrina destroyed many buildings, including the first floor and dormitories of [[Saint Stanislaus College]] and the Bay St. Louis Public Library.

===Harrison County===
[[Image:Katrina-14588.jpg|thumb|270px|right| Hurricane Katrina pushed houses inland on the Mississippi coast, such as at Biloxi.]]

[[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison County]] was hit particularly hard by the hurricane as well as the storm surge. Its two coastal cities, [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] and [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] suffered severe damages and many casualties were reported. By September 1, 126&amp;nbsp;people were already confirmed dead.&lt;ref&gt;Korosec, Thomas. &quot;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3335913 126 dead; gas, hot meals in short supply].&quot; ''[[Houston Chronicle]].'' September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread damage was reported in the city of [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] as several of the city's attractions were destroyed. Many restaurants have been destroyed and several casino barges were pulled out of the water and onto land. Residents that recalled [[Hurricane Camille]] observed that Katrina was, &quot;much worse&quot;, with a storm surge reportedly reaching further inland. Katrina's wind estimates were lighter than Camille's, and the central air pressure was slightly higher, but Camille was also a much smaller storm so the greater impact of the storm surge may be due to the size.

The Biloxi-Ocean Springs Bridge was totally destroyed, and [[U.S. Highway 90|US 90]] had heavy debris and severe damage to the roadbed.

[[Keesler Air Force Base]] in Biloxi was also damaged extensively.

In [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]], the destruction was almost complete.

===Jackson County===
[[Jackson County, Mississippi]] had a coastal storm tide of, at least, {{convert|22|ft|m}}, with Hurricane Katrina coming ashore during the morning high tide. Reports stated that 90% of [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] was flooded by the storm surge, and the storm was so intense that 3 [[US Navy]] ships were damaged.  [[Moss Point, Mississippi|Moss Point]] and [[Escatawpa, Mississippi|Escatawpa]] were also affected.

Although the severe hurricane-force winds were mainly east of downtown New Orleans, extending into Alabama, heavy rainfall led to inland flooding, including counties in western Mississippi. Also, the eastern outer bands of Hurricane Katrina spawned 62 tornadoes to the northeast (none in Louisiana), with 11 tornadoes in Mississippi, and even 2 in Georgia.

For those reasons, all counties in Mississippi were affected in some tangible way, and hence, all Mississippi counties were designated as disaster areas for Federal assistance, with 49 lower counties eligible for full individual and public assistance.
{{-}}

==Alabama==
[[Image:Katrina Bayou La Batre 2005 boats ashore.jpg|thumb|310px|right| [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama]]: Cargo ship &amp; fishing boats.]]

Hurricane Katrina was the 5th recent storm to hit Alabama, and Alabama suffered widespread, moderate to heavy damage caused by hurricane-force winds, flooding by a storm tide of 14–18&amp;nbsp;feet, and tornadoes.&lt;ref name=TCRaug&gt;
   &quot;Tropical Cyclone Report, Hurricane Katrina&quot; (post-analysis),
   [[National Hurricane Center]], revised August 10, 2006, web PDF file:
   [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf TCR-pdf].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Massive damage occurred along coastal areas, pushing small ships and oil rigs ashore, flooding fishing areas with dozens of shrimp boats, destroying marinas plus hundreds of boardwalks, and swamping beachfront homes or hotels, with widespread tree damage and roofs or shingles torn off. Afterward, 22 counties in Alabama were declared disaster areas for Federal assistance (see map above, &quot;Federal Disaster Areas&quot;), spanning a 400-mile (640-km) region.

[[Mobile Bay]] spilled into downtown [[Mobile, Alabama]] to the depth of {{convert|2|-|6|ft|m}}. A [[flotel]] (floating habitat used by [[oil platform]] crews) broke loose of its moorings and slammed into the [[Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge]], the bridge damage was later found not to be critical but in the meantime it traffic was reduced from four lanes to two. There was cause for concern because the bridge, in conjunction with underwater tunnels, is a part of the I-10 Hazardous Materials route across the [[Mobile River]]. The [[Battleship Parkway]] crossing [[Mobile Bay]] was also closed before the storm and was completely submerged during the hurricane. Many coastal homes south of the Point Clear area were severely damaged, flooded, or swept away.

Damage was quite heavy in coastal Alabama (comparable to [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004), including significant structural damage to buildings. [[Bayou La Batre]], a fishing town, sustained significant damage to its infrastructure and fishing fleet. It was the focal point of public attention given to Alabama in the aftermath of the storm. On Sunday, September 4, 2005, U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] visited a community center in Bayou La Batre and surveyed storm damage with [[Alabama]] Governor [[Bob Riley]].&lt;ref&gt;

   Staff writer, [[CBS News]], September 4, 2005,
   Retrieved on August 29, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some damage was reported in inland Alabama, as well, particularly related to fallen trees. An oil platform also became grounded near [[Dauphin Island]].

More than 584,000&amp;nbsp;people were left without power in Alabama immediately after the storm. Tornadoes were also reported near [[Brewton, Alabama|Brewton]].

Towns on the Eastern Shore began regaining electric power on August 30, and power was restored to sections of Mobile beginning on the 5th day, September 3, 2005.

An (inland) tropical storm wind warning was issued in every county in Alabama along and west of I-65.

==Georgia==
Western Georgia was hit with the outer bands of Hurricane Katrina, resulting in heavy rains, damaging winds and several reports of tornadoes in [[Polk County, Georgia|Polk]], [[Heard County, Georgia|Heard]], and [[Carroll County, Georgia|Carroll]] counties. In Polk County, three homes were reported damaged by a tornado. A fatal tornado in Carroll County resulted in the death of one person in a vehicle collision and caused damage to as many as 30 homes, and one additional fatality was reported.

Severe weather was also reported in northeastern Georgia, including tornadoes in [[White County, Georgia|White]] and [[Hall County, Georgia|Hall]] counties. In White County, a tornado struck the tourist town of [[Helen, Georgia|Helen]], ripping the top floor from an Econolodge hotel and damaging businesses at a nearby outlet mall. Thirty people were displaced by the storm, but no injuries were reported. In Hall County, several homes were reported damaged by a possible tornado in [[Lula, Georgia|Lula]]. A tornado in a feeder band moved through [[Decatur County, Georgia|Decatur County]] to the west of [[Bainbridge, Georgia|Bainbridge]] in southwestern Georgia during the evening of August 29.

On August 31, the price of gasoline shot up dramatically in and around the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], reaching as high as $6 per gallon. This was mainly due to consumer panic about lack of gasoline caused by Hurricane Katrina, which disrupted oil pumps in the Gulf of Mexico.

==Other U.S. states and Canadian provinces==
===Arkansas===
Arkansas avoided damage from Katrina, as the storm passed to the east. The state established KARE (Katrina Assistance Relief Effort), a toll free telephone number and website for evacuees seeking assistance, and provided deep discounts on spaces at its state parks, waiving pet restrictions, and allowing evacuees to stay even if other travelers have confirmed reservations (bumped travelers were offered either space at another state park or a gift certificate for future use). The [[governor]] instructed state agencies to take care of human needs first and worry about paperwork later.

===Kentucky===
Western Kentucky was already suffering flooding from storms that had passed through during the weekend prior to Katrina's arrival. Part of [[Christian County, Kentucky|Christian County]] High School, located just outside [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]], collapsed during the weekend. Significant flooding has been reported in the Hopkinsville area, and many homes were flooded. One person was also killed in flood waters during Katrina that had already been high from the previous storm.

Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]], declared [[Christian County, Kentucky|Christian]], [[Todd County, Kentucky|Todd]] and [[Trigg County, Kentucky|Trigg]] counties disaster areas due to flooding, and declared a statewide state of emergency.

===New York===
Western New York had many reports of flooding, as well as damage caused by fallen trees as a result of Katrina. At least 4,500 customers were left without power in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] areas.

Damage (primarily to trees which knocked into some neighborhoods) and flooding was also reported in the northern part of the state, near the [[Ontario]] border. About 1,100 customers lost power in that area.

===New Jersey===
New Jersey experienced minor flooding and minor power outages from the remnants, the same impact as New York experienced.

===North Carolina===
North Carolina avoided damage from the storm, but gas prices rose in response to interrupted supply lines. Local hospitals received some regional evacuees.

===Ohio===
In Ohio, some flooding and power outages were reported (including about 2,500 in the easternmost part of the state alone), and several areas were evacuated throughout the state. One hospital had to be evacuated as it lost power and its generator failed in [[Dennison, Ohio|Dennison]], but it was restored later in the day. Two deaths were blamed on the storm in Ohio, both indirect deaths from an automobile accident caused by Katrina's rains in [[Huron County, Ohio|Huron County]] north of the village of [[Monroeville, Ohio|Monroeville]].

A force [[Fujita scale|F-0]] [[tornado]] hit [[Warren County, Ohio|Warren County]] on August 30, causing minor damage in [[Morrow, Ohio|Morrow]] and [[Salem Township, Warren County, Ohio|Salem Township]]. Three houses were damaged but no injuries were reported.

===Ontario===
On August 30 heavy rain and tropical storm force wind gusts were reported in Southern [[Ontario]] as Katrina passed over the area before dissipating into a remnant low in the east. [[Port Colborne, Ontario|Port Colborne]] and [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]] appeared to receive the most rain, both with over {{convert|4|in|cm|2}}. Other regions in the province reported {{convert|1|-|2|in|cm}} of rain, except near the [[New York]] border where up to {{convert|3|in|cm|2}} was reported. There were also some spotty reports of flooding and damage due to fallen trees.

===Pennsylvania===
In Pennsylvania, at least two tornadoes spawned from Katrina's outer bands and touched down in south-central part of the state south of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. Numerous trees were brought down and several roofs damaged.

===Quebec===
On August 31, the storm system previously known as Katrina was partially absorbed by a front and continued to produce heavy rainfall down the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley. Several villages in the northeastern part of Quebec have been isolated due to multiple washouts. Sections of roads were destroyed, effectively cutting these villages off via land travel. Affected areas were supplied by boats normally supplying the [[Magdalen Islands]]. The system crossed over uninhabited areas of [[Labrador]] before completely dissipating.

===Tennessee===
At the storm's peak, at least 80,000 customers were without power, primarily in the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] areas.

Some damage has been reported, primarily due to fallen trees. However, there have been no deaths or injuries reported in Tennessee as a result of Katrina.

Tennessee was also being used as a staging area for Gulf Coast evacuees, particularly in and around Memphis.

===Texas===
[[Image:Katrina-14451.jpg|thumb||right|300px|Evacuees taking shelter at the [[Reliant Astrodome]].]]
Texas avoided any direct damage from Hurricane Katrina, but the state took in an estimated 220,000&amp;nbsp;people who have sought refuge from Louisiana and has overwhelmed many local resources.

On August 31, the [[Harris County, Texas]] Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the State of Louisiana came to an agreement to allow at least 25,000 evacuees from [[New Orleans]], especially those who were sheltered in the [[Louisiana Superdome]], to move to the Astrodome until they could return home. The evacuation began on September 1. President George W. Bush announced on September 4 that additional evacuees would be airlifted to other states.

The [[Reliant Astrodome]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] took on some of the 25,000 who had initially sought shelter in the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in New Orleans, but quickly reached capacity and by September 2, was unable to accept additional hurricane evacuees from the disaster. The Astrodome was reopened a few hours later, after it was announced that all events through December 2005 would be cancelled so as to open the building to an additional 11,000 evacuees. City officials then opened two additional buildings adjacent to the Dome, the Arena, and the Center, as well as the [[George R. Brown Convention Center]] in downtown Houston to house additional guests.

When the Houston shelters began to reach capacity on September 2, Governor [[Rick Perry]] activated an emergency plan that made space for an additional 25,000 each in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]], as well as smaller shelters in communities across Texas. Beginning with a convoy of 50 buses (2,700&amp;nbsp;people) that arrived at [[Reunion Arena]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] at 3:00 a.m. CST on September 3, a wave of over 120,000 additional evacuees began pouring into Texas at a rate, such that, as of September 5, it was estimated there are roughly 139,000 evacuees in official shelters around the state. This added to the estimated 90,000 that were already in hotels and homes. Dallas quickly sought help from nearby cities to help accommodate more evacuees. A staging area at the unused [[Big Town Mall]] in [[Mesquite, Texas|Mesquite]] was opened, but was also overloaded quickly. [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] and [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] have accepted some evacuees and towns from as far away as [[Bonham, Texas|Bonham]] and even [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] have offered to help.

By the afternoon of September 5, with a total estimated number of over 230,000 evacuees in [[Texas]], Governor Perry ordered that buses begin being diverted to other shelters outside the state resulting in 20,000 being sent to [[Oklahoma]] and 30,000 being sent to [[Arkansas]]. By September 6, Texas had an estimated 250,000 evacuees and Governor Perry was forced to declare a state of emergency in Texas and issued an impassioned plea to other states to begin taking the 40,000-50,000 evacuees that were still in need of shelter.

Many communities in Texas have opened up many of their services to evacuees from Louisiana, offering speedier enrollment for children in local school districts, access to the Texas food stamp program, as well as health services for those being treated for diseases like [[tuberculosis]] and [[HIV]]. Texas state parks are open free of charge to evacuees.

More than 300 students from [[Tulane University]], including the school's [[American football|football]] team, were displaced to [[Southern Methodist University]] in Dallas.

The [[New Orleans Saints]] [[National Football League|NFL]] football team, who are also displaced from their home facility at the Superdome, have moved to San Antonio. The Saints' [[2005 NFL season|2005]] home games were split between the [[Alamodome]] in San Antonio and [[Louisiana State University]]'s [[Tiger Stadium (Baton Rouge)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. On December 30, 2005, the team and the league announcing that the club will play a split schedule again in 2006 between Baton Rouge and New Orleans' [[Louisiana Superdome]], with the first game at the Superdome on September 24, 2006.

===Virginia===
In Virginia, a tornado related to Katrina's outer bands touched down in [[Marshall, Virginia|Marshall]], damaging at least 13 homes. In addition, electricity was cut for about 4,000 customers. No deaths or injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Dena. &quot;[http://www.wusatv9.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=42585 Katrina Damages Homes In Fauquier County].&quot; ''[[WUSA (TV)]].'' August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Virginia===
Significant flooding has been reported in several communities in West Virginia, including [[Sissonville, West Virginia|Sissonville]], forcing some local evacuations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20786">The '''economic effects of Hurricane Katrina''', which hit [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]] in late August 2005, were far-reaching.                                                                                                                                                2006, the Bush Administration had sought [[United States Dollar|$]]105&amp;nbsp;billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region, making it the costliest natural disaster in US history.&lt;ref&gt;St. Onge, Jeff; Epstein, Victor. &quot;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/04/01/ex_chief_says_fema_readiness_even_worse/ Ex-chief says FEMA readiness even worse].&quot; ''Boston.com.'' May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; And this does not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the [[petroleum|oil]] supply and exports of commodities such as cotton. Also, before [[Hurricane Katrina]], the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs, with 600,000 of them in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. One study, by Mark Burton and [[Michael J. Hicks]] estimated the total economic impact to Louisiana and Mississippi may exceed [[United States Dollar|$]]150&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Mark L.;  [[Michael J. Hicks]]. &quot;[http://www.marshall.edu/cber/research/katrina/Katrina-Estimates.pdf Hurricane Katrina: Preliminary Estimates of Commercial and Public Sector Damages].&quot; ''[[Marshall University]]: Center for Business and Economic Research.'' September, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hundreds of thousands of residents of southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including nearly everyone who lived in New Orleans, were left unemployed. No paychecks were being cashed and no money was being spent, and therefore no taxes were being collected by local governments. The lack of revenue will limit the resources of the affected communities and states for years to come. Before the storm, the region was already one of the poorest in America with one of the highest unemployment rates. Furthermore, [[Jim Sensenbrenner]], Republican chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], has refused to allow victims of the hurricane to take advantage of any exception to the recent [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005|Bankruptcy Reform]], a recent bill passed with widespread support of the banking industry that aims to curb abuse of bankruptcy protection by repeat filers and those who are able to repay debts reasonably. &quot;If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40% or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply,&quot; Sensenbrenner said.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, Martin H. &quot;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/katrina_bankruptcy03.html No Bankruptcy Relief for Katrina Victims].&quot; ''ConsumerAffairs.com.'' September 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also some concern when, on September 8, 2005, President Bush temporarily suspended the [[Davis-Bacon Act]] in the affected areas, which allowed for contractors working on Federal construction projects to be paid less than the prevailing local wage.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W. &quot;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050908-5.html Proclamation by the President: To Suspend Subchapter IV of Chapter 31 of Title 40, United States Code, Within a Limited Geographic Area in Response to the National Emergency Caused by Hurricane Katrina].&quot; ''[[White House]].'' September 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The concerns over these actions were primarily that allowing the government to pay less than the [[prevailing wage]] would contribute to increased poverty in the region, which already ranked among the lowest in the nation in terms of household income.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/income02/statemhi.html U.S. Census Data: Three-Year-Average Median Household Income by State: 2000-2002].&quot; ''[[U.S. Census Bureau]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The act was later reinstated on October 26, 2005, amid political pressure from both Democrats and Republicans in the [[United States Congress]].
==Oil production==

[[File:Sheetz Sign.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sign showing gas prices in front of [[Sheetz]] in [[Mount Jackson, Virginia]], on August 31, 2005, just as Hurricane Katrina began to make its mark on the price of gasoline. Prices had risen thirty cents since the previous day, and would rise an additional twenty cents before the day was over.]]
{{seealso|Oil price increases since 2003}}
The storm interrupted oil production, importation, and refining in the Gulf eden, thus having a major effect on fuel prices. Before the storm, one-tenth of all the [[crude oil]] consumed in the United States and almost half of the gasoline produced in the country came from refineries in the states along the Gulf's shores. An additional 24% of the [[natural gas]] supply is extracted or imported in the region. Furthermore, the nation's [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] is also stored in this region.

Power outages in the wake of Katrina have also caused distribution problems for oil and natural gas.  Pipelines which move petroleum products from places like [[Houston]] to areas of the east coast have had their flows interrupted because power outages shut down the pumps that kept materials flowing. [[Dick Cheney]] personally called the manager of the [[Southern Pines Electric Power Association]] on the night of August 30 and again the next morning and ordered him to divert power crews to [[Electrical substation|substation]]s in nearby [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]] that were essential to the operation of the [[Colonial Pipeline]], which carries gasoline and [[diesel fuel]] from [[Texas]] to the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].&lt;ref&gt;Maute, Nikki D. &quot;[http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050911/NEWS05/509110304 Power crews diverted: Restoring pipeline came first].&quot; ''Hattiesburg American.'' September 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least twenty offshore [[oil platform]]s were missing, sunk, or had gone adrift, according to the [[United States Coast Guard]]. One oil rig, in dock for repairs before the storm, broke loose and hit the Cochrane/Africatown USA road bridge over the [[Mobile River]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. Two others went adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, but they were recovered. One platform, originally located 12 mi (20&amp;nbsp;km) off the Louisiana coast, has washed up onshore at [[Dauphin Island, Alabama]]. [[Shell Oil Company]]'s MARS platform, producing around {{convert|147000|oilbbl|m3}} per day, was also severely damaged.

At 7:03 a.m. CDT on August 29, Ted Falgout, Port Director of [[Port Fourchon, Louisiana]], a key oil and gas hub 60 mi (100&amp;nbsp;km) south of New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico, reported that the port had taken a direct hit from the hurricane. The port services approximately 16% of the nation’s supply of crude oil and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release. &quot;[http://www.dotd.louisiana.gov/press/pressrelease.asp?nRelease=339 FHWA Issues Record of Decision on LA 1 Improvements].&quot; ''Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development.'' January 31, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Falgout, Hurricane Katrina, &quot;will impact oil and gas infrastructure, not just short term but long term as well. The impact of the storm &amp;mdash; the Gulf is shut down; all of the area of the storm is shut down; a half billion dollars a day of oil and gas is unavailable.&quot;
[[File:Katrina-loop gif.gif|left|thumb|Port Fourchon takes direct hit from Katrina (7 a.m. CDT,29 August 2005)]]
The [[Louisiana Offshore Oil Port]], which imports 11% of all U.S. oil consumption, closed on August 27, and Shell reported a reduction in production of {{convert|420000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref&gt;Laverty, Gene. &quot;[http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&amp;sid=aF9SxgEvDm.Y&amp;refer=home Oil, Gas May Soar as Storm Shuts U.S. Gulf Production].&quot; ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]].'' August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The port was undamaged by the storm and resumed operation within hours of getting power back.

Due to fears that the production of oil in the United States will be cut by up to one-third of normal capacity, the price of oil fluctuated greatly. [[West Texas Intermediate]] crude oil futures reached a record high of over [[United States Dollar|$]]70 per barrel ($0.44/L). There were many reports to Louisiana authorities and elsewhere of [[price gouging]], not only for gasoline, but also for other needed items such as bottled water. In some areas, gasoline was being sold for as much as $6 per gallon ($1.59 per liter). One BP station in [[Stockbridge, Georgia]], south of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], was selling gas at $5.87 per gallon ($1.55 per liter) less than a day after Katrina hit. Just before the storm, average fuel prices were approximately $2.50 per US gallon ($0.66/L). International oil prices also rose. In the [[United Kingdom]], pump prices for unleaded petrol (gas) hit [[Pound sterling|£]]1 per litre ($7 per U.S. gallon) for the first time in a significant number of places (averaging about 95[[Pence|p]]), a rise of about 3% from pre-Katrina prices. Wholesale prices were up 5% by September 6.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4215346.stm:Site_sources UK petrol prices continue to rise].&quot; ''[[BBC News]].'' September 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long lines developed at some gas stations throughout the U.S. as customers rushed to buy gasoline, anticipating price increases in the wake of the storm. Emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and in light of similar incidents in his own state, Governor [[Mike Easley]] of [[North Carolina]] has issued a statement asking all North Carolinians to conserve gas, limit fuel consumption and non-essential road trips, and for state employees to car pool.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.wral.com/news/4921679/detail.html Gov. Mike Easley Statement On N.C. Gasoline Supply].&quot; ''[[WRAL-TV]].''&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the Governor's announcement, many gas stations around the state ran out of gas and lines were formed at others.

By 12:00 p.m. CDT on August 31, eight Gulf of Mexico refineries remained shut down and one was operating at reduced capacity. Evaluation of five of the eight refineries was delayed due to limited access. Aside from the problems involved in restarting the refineries (which is a lengthy process) there were additional major issues with worker housing, since a large proportion of homes were destroyed by the hurricane.

The Environmental Protection Agency moved to reduce prices by temporarily lifting fuel standards in America until September 15. Some crude oil was also released from the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve]], as well, to combat prices as major economic consequences were predicted if prices remained high for a long period of time &amp;mdash; leading consumer spending to drop and causing many foreign economies, especially in Asia, to suffer. [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] also temporarily waived the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], allowing foreign oil companies to ship oil between ports of the United States.

By September 7, Gulf oil production had returned to 42% of normal. Of 10 refineries that were shut down by Katrina, four were expected to be back at full capacity within a week, however another four could be out of commission for months.

==Gambling and entertainment==

Katrina forced many [[List of casinos#Mississippi|casinos]] along the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]] to close and evacuate. The [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Biloxi)|Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino]] was scheduled to open the first week of September, but did not open until June 30, 2007. The [[Beau Rivage Casino Biloxi|Beau Rivage]] was severely damaged by water that reached the third floor, but seems to have suffered the least damage of the beachfront casinos. [[Grand Casino Biloxi]] had its mammoth gaming barge blown across [[U.S. 90]]. [[Treasure Bay Casino Biloxi|Treasure Bay]]'s [[pirate ship]] was heavily damaged and washed ashore, it was subsequently dismantled down to the underlying barge. The [[President Casino Biloxi]] was washed across U.S. 90 and landed on top of a [[Holiday Inn]], nearly a mile (1.6 km) from the casino's [[Mooring (watercraft)|berth]].

In [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], the western [[Grand Casino Gulfport]] [[barge]], containing Kid's Quest, washed across [[U.S. Highway 90|U.S. 90]] and was left blocking the highway. The [[Copa Casino Gulfport|Copa Casino]] barge was pushed onto land next to the [[Grand Casino Gulfport]]'s [[parking garage]]. [[Casino Magic Biloxi Casino &amp; Hotel|Casino Magic]] and [[Isle of Capri, Biloxi|Isle of Capri]] in Biloxi both suffered heavy damage to their gaming barges, likely beyond repair. Before the storm, at least 14,000&amp;nbsp;people were employed at Gulf Coast casinos. 

Harrah's New Orleans closed shortly before the storm and sustained storm damage. The building was also used by first responders as a base of operations in the days following the storm. The casino reopened on February 17, 2006, just in time for [[Mardi Gras]],&lt;ref&gt;Press Release. &quot;[http://www.harrahs.com/our_casinos/nor/news/2_12_2006.html Harrah's New Orleans Re-Opens Friday, February 17, as the fun and excitement of Mardi Gras Begin].&quot; ''[[Harrah's Entertainment]].'' February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], reopened on August 29, 2006, on the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmon, Tom. &quot;[http://www.sunherald.com/mld/sunherald/news/state/15332601.htm Beau Rivage reopening makes it a family affair].&quot; ''[[The Sun Herald]].'' August 22, 2006. Retrieved on August 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Casino Biloxi is undergoing extensive renovation, and is expected to reopen during the summer of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.gulf-coast.com/News/HarrahsBiloxiPlan.html Harrah's (Grand Casino) First Phase of Reopening].&quot; ''[http://www.gulf-coast.com/ Gulf Coast Information Guide].'' March 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Casino Gulfport was destroyed as portions of the structure collapsed across Highway 90 and was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.wlox.com/Global/story.asp?S=3881524&amp;nav=6DJHduXE Gulfport's Grand Casino Goes Bust - Literally].&quot; ''WLOX-TV.'' September 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mississippi will lose approximately [[United States Dollar|$]]500,000 in [[tax revenue]] for each day that the [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]-area [[riverboat casino]]s are closed, and about $140,000 per day for the South River region casinos. As a comparison, in 2004, Mississippi earned $2.7&amp;nbsp;billion in casino revenues, third behind [[Nevada]] and [[New Jersey]] ($10.3&amp;nbsp;billion and $4.8&amp;nbsp;billion, respectively).

Katrina was directly related, three years after the hurricane, to the controversial [[National Basketball Association]] [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City]].  [[New Orleans Hornets|New Orleans' NBA franchise]] was forced to move temporarily;  the Hornets chose a mix of the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center]] in Baton Rouge, and the [[Chesapeake Energy Arena|Ford Center]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] while [[New Orleans Arena]] was being rebuilt.  The success of the Hornets in the Ford Center (which the Hornets had a deal where the team would split its games for two years) directly led to Oklahoma City interests purchasing the Seattle SuperSonics, which was for sale, and move to become the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in 2008.

==Agriculture and forestry==

According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), the national impact of Hurricane Katrina on Gulf Coast crops was minimal, with most of the damage borne by minor producers of major crops (corn, soybeans, and cotton).&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.abc.net.au/rural/content/2005/s1459214.htm Impact on US crops from hurricane minimal, says USDA].&quot; ''[http://www.abc.net.au/ ABC].'' September 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The main impact of the storm on agriculture is likely to involve [[Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina#Ocean shipping|ocean shipping]] and exports. In 2004, 22% of U.S. wheat exports, 71% of corn exports, and 65% of soybean exports passed through Gulf ports. Shipping did not occur until later in the fall, when ports would again be operational.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Robert J. &quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9190518/site/newsweek/ Hitting the Economy].&quot; ''[[MSNBC]].'' September 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 50 Mississippi counties covered by the Presidential primary natural disaster designation, the USDA declared an additional 31 counties as primary agricultural disaster areas. This made farmers and other agricultural producers eligible for low interest emergency loans to cover losses. The remaining four Mississippi counties were classified as, &quot;contiguous&quot; and were also eligible for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Westcott, Stevin. &quot;[http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB/.cmd/ad/.ar/sa.retrievecontent/.c/6_2_1UH/.ce/7_2_5JM/.p/5_2_4TQ/.d/0/_th/J_2_9D/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?PC_7_2_5JM_contentid=2005%2F09%2F0364.xml#7_2_5JM USDA Designates Counties in Mississippi as Agricultural Disaster Areas].&quot; ''[[United States Department of Agriculture]].'' September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gulfport, Mississippi]] serves as a major ocean [[shipping]] port for the southern United States, which was found to be inoperable for as much as one year. [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]], [[Dole Food Company|Dole]], [[Crowley Maritime Corporation|Crowley]], [[Gearbulk]], [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;amp;O]], and others had significant operations in Gulfport. On a short-term basis these companies have relocated necessary operations to unaffected ports.

[[Forestry]] constitutes a major industry in southern Mississippi, accounting for 10% of all jobs in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.msforestry.net/forestryfacts.html Mississippi Forestry Facts].&quot; ''Mississippi Forestry Association.'' Accessed 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Mississippi Forestry Commission, Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to 1.3&amp;nbsp;million acres (5,300&amp;nbsp;km²) of forestland in the state. The greatest damage occurred from the coastal counties northward to [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]], with heavy damage to pine forests in [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]], and [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River]] countries.

An estimated 14.6&amp;nbsp;million [[Wood fuel#Measurement of firewood|cords]] (52,900,000 m³) of paperwood and 3.2&amp;nbsp;billion [[Board foot|board feet]] (7,600,000 m³) of sawtimber were destroyed.  The estimated economic impact of this loss was $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion. Additionally, there was an estimated $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion in damage to urban trees in 181 Mississippi communities.&lt;ref&gt;Grizzard, Kent. &quot;[http://www.mfc.state.ms.us/pdf/katrina/timberdamage.pdf Forestry Commission Reports $2.4 billion of Tree Damage].&quot; ''Mississippi Forestry Commission.''

==Utilities==

The local electric utility [[Entergy Corporation]] was impacted severely, and Entergy New Orleans filed for bankruptcy protection on September 23, 2005. The company cited lower revenue and storm restoration costs as the primary cause. Parent company Entergy Corporation promptly arranged $100&amp;nbsp;million in financing.

==Insurance Response==

The Insurance Information Institute reports that Hurricane Katrina was the costliest disaster in the history of insurance.  It said that the insurance industry paid $41.1 billion ($45.1 billion in 2009 dollars) and more than 1.7 million claims – across six states. Some 15,000 claims adjusters from across the country were called in to handle the record number of claims for damage to homes, businesses and vehicles.  Louisiana accounted for 63 percent of insured losses and Mississippi accounted for one-third. 
In addition, the federal government-operated National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) paid out $16.1 billion in claims from flooding.  Damage from flooding, including storm surge from a hurricane, is covered by the NFIP, but is not covered under standard homeowners insurance policies.  
The Institute also said another $2 billion to $3 billion of insured damages occurred at off-shore energy facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Insurance Information Institute Issues Update, Catastrophes: Insurance Issues. &quot;[http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/catastrophes/].&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;

Many '''countries and international organizations offered the [[United States]] [[Hurricane Katrina disaster relief|relief aid]]''' in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]].
{{CompactTOC8}}

According to the European Commission, one week after the disaster, on September 4, 2005, the United States officially asked the [[European Union]] for emergency help, asking for blankets, emergency medical kits, water and 500,000 food rations for victims. Help proposed by EU member states was coordinated through their crisis center. The British presidency of the EU functioned as contact with the USA.

Other countries not on this list also offered aid, but the State Department mentioned that they (the State Department) had not been asked.

{{Cleanup|date=September 2008}}
The [[disaster recovery]] response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] included federal government agencies such 
as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), state and local-level agencies, federal and National Guard soldiers, non-governmental organizations, charities, and private individuals. Tens of thousands of volunteers and troops responded or were deployed to the disaster - most in the affected area but also throughout the U.S. at shelters set up in at least 19 states.

==Overview==
Monetary donations broke records set by the tsunami and 9/11 relief efforts in the U.S. In a reversal of usual positions, the U.S. received international aid and assistance from numerous countries.  The National Disaster Medical System had activated essentially all teams in the country, and pre-staged multiple Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs), Disaster Mortuary Assistance Teams (DMORTs), and Veterinary Medicine Response Teams (VMATs)in Houston and Atlanta the day prior to, and the day of, landfall. When the levees were reported to have broken, the DMATs were moved to Baton Rouge on Tuesday, August 30, and as the needs were identified, teams were moved out that afternoon to the Super Dome, and that night to the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. Three DMATs arrived around 0200 hours on Wednesday morning, Aug 31st, and set up a field hospital Base of Operations in Concourse D, and began offloading rescuees from helicopters, and providing all levels of medical care. Additional DMATs were deployed there as the volume and tempo of patient arrivals increased, as the hospitals in the city began to evacuate their patients. Over 3,000 patients were cared for, and as DOD Medevac assets began arriving, patients were handed over and moved out to over a dozen cities. This operation peaked during the weekend of September 3 and 4th, and was completed by mid-week. Over 20,000 evacuees were also flown out by the civilian airfleet drafted into service, and 25 deaths occurred there, mostly elderly nursing home and hospice evacuees.

More than 10,000 [[United States National Guard|Army]] and [[Air National Guard]]smen and 7,200 active-duty troops were stationed in the [[Gulf Coast]] region to assist with hurricane relief operations with some remaining several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050903/ap_on_re_us/katrina_national_guard&lt;/ref&gt; The military relief effort, known as ''Joint Task Force Katrina'', is being commanded by [[Lieutenant General]] [[Russel L. Honoré]], commander of the [[US First Army]]. At President Bush's urging, the U.S. Senate quickly approved $10.5&amp;nbsp;billion in aid for victims September 1, 2005. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] voted and approved on the measure Friday, September 2, 2005 without any debate. President Bush requested an additional $51.8&amp;nbsp;billion on September 7. Congress approved that funding package the next day.

On September 24, 2005, following the havoc caused by [[Hurricane Rita]], the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] named Brig. Gen.

It is their mission to provide relief support for all of the areas in Texas and Louisiana effected by the two storms and to remove obstructions that might otherwise hinder help to those effected.

Governments of many countries have offered help to the U.S. for disaster relief, including the governments of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] and [[Mexico]], with Canada even offering to accept Katrina evacuees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,372482-3,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to asking for federal funds, President Bush has enlisted the help of former presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] to raise additional voluntary contributions, much as they did after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and [[tsunami]].

Many had been critical of the slow response, with many people (particularly in New Orleans) left without [[drinking water|water]] and food for three to five days after the storm. Among the first to express criticism of the management of the crisis had been [[The Pentagon]], who complained only a day after Katrina hit that bureaucratic red tape from the Bush administration and the FEMA (newly reorganized under the [[Homeland Security Department]]) had caused the delay of a scheduled and authorized military [[hospital ship]] from [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], among other related and prepared active military crisis response procedures.

==Recovery==

Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast of the United States in August 2005, exposed area residents to trauma and extensive property loss. However, little is known about the long-run effects of the hurricane on the mental health of those who were exposed. This study documents long-run changes in mental health among a particularly vulnerable group—low income mothers—from before to after the hurricane, and identifies factors that are associated with different recovery trajectories. Longitudinal surveys of 532 low-income mothers from New Orleans were conducted approximately one year before, 7–19 months after, and 43–54 months after Hurricane Katrina. While the federal government has slowly begun to grapple with the costs of rebuilding levees and decimated neighborhoods, arts institutions in southern Louisiana and Mississippi are facing a harsh reality: No public funds of any sort have been earmarked for their recovery. And operating dollars, never very easy to come by, are drying up.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Stuart. &quot;Starting Over.&quot; American Theatre 23.2 (2006): 48-51. Literary Reference Center Plus.

==Confusion over chain of command==

The federal agencies said that they were there to &quot;support&quot; the state and local government agencies. The national guard claimed the same.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On Saturday, September 3, [[NPR]] reported there was 'no central command post' and people were not being told when they would be evacuated from New Orleans.

==Timeline==
{{main|Timeline of Hurricane Katrina}}

===Friday, August 26===
The [[National Hurricane Center]] predicted for the first time that Katrina would become a [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] storm, and thus exceed the design limits of the New Orleans levees.

===Saturday, August 27===
[[File:Fema827map.gif|frame|Map of Louisiana parishes eligible for Category B assistance due to September 27 authorization]]
President Bush declared a state of emergency under the authority of the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Stafford Act]] for the inland parishes of Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fema.gov/news/eventdfrns.fema?id=4786&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunday, August 28===
Katrina became a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/at200512.asp&lt;/ref&gt; New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] declared a mandatory evacuation of the city, and opened the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] to those who couldn't leave the city. 550 National Guard troops were stationed inside the Superdome to screen refugees for weapons
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05240/561722.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=The poor and frail flock to Superdome for safety from Katrina | first=Mary | last=Foster | date=August 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that point, it was known that the strength of the hurricane would almost certainly exceed the levees' design capacity, and therefore the possibility for major flooding was real. If the levees did fail, people throughout the city would find it very difficult to obtain food and water. If authorities had wanted to pre-position food, the Superdome would have been a logical place, as the population knew it was a designated central location. The Louisiana National Guard delivered enough food for 15,000&amp;nbsp;people for 3&amp;nbsp;days.

President Bush declared an emergency in six counties of Alabama 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=4806&lt;/ref&gt; and 11 in Mississippi
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=4787&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monday, August 29===
At 6:10 am local time, Katrina made landfall.

The Louisiana National Guard had called almost 3,500 of its members to state active duty as of 7 a.m.  Army Lt. Col. Pete Schneider reported a successful evacuation from the city, crediting the Louisiana Guard's partners in neighboring states for carrying out &quot;a coordinated effort&quot; that incorporated lessons learned from past evacuations.  Schneider said during an interview today with Fox News the state stood ready to house evacuees at the Superdome &quot;for as long as it takes&quot;, reporting that although the massive structure's protective lining tore in the hurricane's Category&amp;nbsp;4 winds, the roof itself appears to be intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050829_2559.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisiana has 65 percent of its troops available for state missions; Mississippi, 60 percent; Alabama, 77 percent; and Florida, 74 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050829_2564.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuesday, August 30===
[[File:USS Bataan (LHD-5);10080504.jpg|thumb|[[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] performed Louisiana relief operations.]]
[[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] was positioned near New Orleans prior to Katrina making landfall, and began relief operations on August 30.

An estimated 7,500 National Guard troops from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi were on duty today, supporting civil authorities, distributing generators, providing medical care, and setting up shelters for displaced residents. As of 8 a.m., almost 3,800 Louisiana Army and Air Guard members were on duty to remove debris, provide security and shelter, distribute water, food and ice, and offer medical and law-enforcement support. The Louisiana Guard was coordinating with Florida, Georgia and Texas to secure two UH-60 Black Hawk and five CH-47 Chinook helicopters to support their operations. In Mississippi, more than 1,900 Guard troops were providing similar support, basing their operations at Camp Shelby. In Florida, more than 700 Florida Guard members were on active duty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050830_2570.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The JTF Katrina JFMCC was later shifted to New Orleans upon arrival of USS IWO JIMA and the Deployable Joint Command and Control [[DJC2]] operations center.  USS IWO JIMA also served as the Presidential Support Platform, JTF Katrina Forward, and Joint Rescue Coordination Center while import New Orleans.

First report of relief supplies delivered to Superdome.

The guardsmen remain under their respective governors' control, which enables them to provide law-enforcement support in the affected regions—something the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] prohibits active-duty forces from doing within the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;dod.mil&quot;/&gt;

===Thursday, September 1===
National Guardsmen accompanied by buses (475 in all) and supply trucks arrived at the Superdome.  Media reports &quot;few buses&quot; there.

FEMA director [[Michael D. Brown|Brown]] said that he had only earlier that day learned that the New Orleans Convention Center had contained thousands of people without food or water for 3–4&amp;nbsp;days. He said trucks were on the way and should be there &quot;any time&quot;. At this point major news sources had been reporting on the situation for a few days.

===Friday, September 2===
Seven days after firm predictions of a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane, a convoy of several dozen trucks and buses rolled into New Orleans carrying food, water, and other supplies. Some of these trucks were PLS manufactured &lt;ref&gt;http://www.army.mil/fact_files_site/pls/&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Oshkosh Truck Corporation]]. These transports can carry more than 15 tons of cargo and can travel in {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water.

For comparison, when the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004]] tsunami struck the politically fractured city of [[Banda Aceh]] without warning, [[Indonesia]]n officials not only knew about the situation on the ground, but delivered 175 tons of food only 2&amp;nbsp;days after the disaster. This was due to the fact that the transports were of a worldwide effort, whereas the Katrina relief effort was handled by the Federal government, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/12/28/world/main663622.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Tsunami Toll Tops 55,000 | date=December 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==

===National Guard deployment===

Since the hurricane passed through, the governors of Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana have collectively called to duty more than 10,000 guard troops.

===Coast Guard===
[[File:New Orleans Survivor Flyover.jpg|thumb|250px|A U.S. Coast Guard aircrewman searches for survivors in New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina.]]

The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] responded by moving as many helicopters as it could to the affected areas, calling in aircraft from as far away as [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]]. 500 USCG reservists were called to duty, and many of the hundreds of small boats in the fleet were sent to help. Coast Guard helicopters flew around-the-clock rescue missions. The Coast Guard was saving lives before any other federal agency - despite the fact that almost half the local Coast Guard personnel lost their own homes in the hurricane. They rescued or evacuated more than 33,500&amp;nbsp;people, six times as many as they saved in all of 2004. According to an article in TIME, in the famously decimated St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans, Sheriff Jack Stephens says the Coast Guard was the only federal agency to provide any significant assistance for a full week after the storm.  With 39,400 active-duty personnel, the Coast Guard is tiny- but very effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The amphibious assault ships carried [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] and [[Sikorsky SH-60 Sea Hawk|SH-60 Sea Hawk]] [[helicopter]]s which were already being used in search and rescue operations.  The ''Harry S. Truman'' was used as the command center for Naval operations in the area.
The Navy also arranged to send eight civilian 14-person [[Swift boat]] rescue teams to the disaster zone using [[C-5 Galaxy]] cargo planes.

[[Lieutenant General|Lt. Gen.]] [[Russel L. Honoré]] of the [[United States Army|Army]] was appointed to run a temporary special command, known as Joint Task Force (JTF) Katrina, to coordinate all military responses to the effort, which was based at [[Camp Shelby]] in [[Mississippi]].

The [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch Navy]] frigate Hr. MS. van Amstel arrived September 7.

The [[Mexican Navy]] sent the &quot;Papaloapan&quot; frigate. It arrived on September 8 to the Mississippi shores with 250 metric tons of food, medicines and supplies. It carried two MI-17 helicopters, an ambulance, seven amphibious vehicles and eight 6-track all-terrain vehicles.

The [[United States Air Force]] responded by sending [[search and rescue]], [[medical evacuation|aeromedical evacuation]], relief supplies as well as medical care to the affected areas. Out of the students training on the base around 400 volunteered to stay back and clean up the base. Thanks to their efforts the base was operational 6 months earlier than expected. The Air Force has rescued over 4,000&amp;nbsp;people to date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123011679&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force has also evacuated more than 25,000&amp;nbsp;people in need of medical care from [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]].

Nine million packaged meals have been airlifted into the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.af.mil/news/story_print.asp?storyID=123011608&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government non-military==

===Federal===
Some [[disaster recovery]] response to Katrina began before the storm, with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a [[mortuary]] team with refrigerated trucks. However, the federal government's overall lack of response has been widely criticized since the events occurred.

President George W. Bush asked Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] of the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated Michael Brown, head of the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region.

[[File:FEMA - 19359 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 09-03-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|A FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force in Louisiana after [[Hurricane Katrina]].]]

FEMA deployed all 28 of its [[FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force|Urban Search &amp; Rescue Task Forces]] with 11 going to Mississippi and 7 to Louisiana.  The remaining 10 US&amp;R Task Forces were deployed to Texas staging areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=FEMA | date=September 3, 2005 | title=National Urban Search And Rescue Teams Deployed | url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18582 | accessdate=2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA also deployed 29 [[Disaster Medical Assistance Team]]s (DMAT); 5 [[Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team]]s (DMORT); 2 [[Veterinary Medical Assistance Team]]s (VMAT); and 1 [[FEMA Mental Health Team|Mental Health Team]] to Louisiana and 10 DMATs, 5 DMORTS, 2 VMATS, and 1 Mental Health Team to Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=FEMA | date=September 4, 2005 | title=Hurricane Katrina Response And Recovery Update | url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18602 | accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA also partnered with the Department of Transportation to send 1700 trucks of water, ice, and ready-to-eat meals. The [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] was also sending 390 trucks carrying water, tarpaulins, and even mobile homes and forklifts. The [[United States Public Health Service]] was activated and sent dozens of officers to supervise medical response. Though the hurricane closed several airports for some time to come, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] rushed to reopen one runway at [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]] so that relief flights could begin.

On Friday, September 2, 2005, Reuters published an article stating that five Silver Fox UAVs (the same UAVs being used in Iraq and Afghanistan for intelligence gathering) equipped with thermal imaging technology is going to be used in the search and rescue missions in New Orleans. Pennsylvanian Republican Representative Curt Weldon stated that he was able to bypass government bureaucracy and obtain the UAVs from an unnamed private company. Weldon stated that the UAVs were being shipped to Baton Rouge and requested deployment of US military personnel who is capable of operating the UAVs and that they can be in operation within hours of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050902/tc_nm/weather_katrina_drones_dc&amp;printer=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Homeland Security issued these key statistics as of 10 a.m. on September 3, 2005:&lt;ref name=&quot;dhs.gov&quot;/&gt;

* Lives Saved—11,500
* Citizens Evacuated—25,000
* Water distributed by FEMA—6.7&amp;nbsp;million liters
* [[MRE]]s distributed by FEMA—1.9&amp;nbsp;million
* U.S. Coast Guard—4,000
* National Guard—22,000

Several [[Carnival Cruise Lines|Carnival Cruise]] ships have been chartered by the American government to provide housing for those who require it. The ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' reported on September 4, 2005 that the authorities had requested that aid workers not disclose the final destination of those making the transit because a few had caused a ruckus upon finding that they were heading to a location that they held in disfavor.

===State and local===

Local governments across the U.S. sent aid in the form of ambulances, search teams and disaster supplies. Shelters to house those displaced were established as far away as [[Utah]].	 
The Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism contacted travelers having reservations at state parks to see if the travelers would voluntarily give up their reservations to persons fleeing Katrina, primarily in the southern part of the state where refugees had already taken shelter (at [[Lake Chicot State Park]], just across the Louisiana state line, a 26 member family from New Orleans, including a grandmother on oxygen, occupied seven of the park's cabins). In any event, refugees at state parks would not be evicted for prior reservations, and those with reservations but no room would either get space at another state park or a gift certificate. 

Arkansas Visitors Information Centers in Texarkana, El Dorado, Helena, and Lake Village directed refugees to shelters and hotels/motels with available space.

Governor [[Mike Huckabee]] issued a proclamation releasing $75,000 of state funds to assist shelters in 14 southern and delta counties in Arkansas.  At least 850 members of the Arkansas National Guard have been activated and sent to Louisiana and Mississippi.  Governor Huckabee also announced that the state Departments of Health and Human Services and Emergency Management as well as the Arkansas Pharmacists Association will provide free emergency prescriptions and access to dialysis machines.

Schools and colleges across the country enrolled students displaced by the storm despite uncertainty over where funding would come from. U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said on September 12 that 372,000 elementary and high school students had been displaced. Over 715 schools were closed with at least 36 heavy damaged or completely destroyed. About 100,000 college students were also displaced and at least 15 colleges were still closed at that time. Primary and secondary schools are required to educate any &quot;homeless&quot; students in their district and 25 states reported having taken in Katrina victims. FEMA declared that opening temporary schools and hiring mental health counselors would be reimbursable but the hiring of extra teachers and buying of books would not be.

1000 firefighters volunteered to be sent to the affected region, with their home towns picking up the tab to provide cover in their absence. FEMA had them handing out leaflets, while on 5 September the first assignment for a 50-strong team from Atlanta was &quot;to stand beside President Bush as he tours devastated areas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3004197&lt;/ref&gt;

===AmeriCorps===
[[AmeriCorps]] sent several crews to Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana in response to Hurricane Katrina and [[Hurricane Rita]]. The crews originated from two main organizations, the [[National Civilian Community Corps]] (NCCC) and the Washington Conservation Corps (WCC), as well as from smaller Americorps organizations such as Americorps St. Louis' Emergency Response Team (ERT). The crews performed a number of relief tasks for hurricane survivors, including support on the FEMA/[[Carnival Cruise Lines]] shelter ship, tarping damaged roofs, and debris removal. As of the beginning of 2006, AmeriCorps teams have been involved in the rebuilding efforts in Louisiana and Mississippi. As of May 2006, AmeriCorps reported that it would continue to send relief to affected areas.

===American Red Cross===
[[File:Katrina-14501.jpg|thumb|American Red Cross personnel attending refugees in the [[Reliant Astrodome]].]]
The [[American Red Cross]] mobilized the largest relief effort in its 124-year history to aid the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Local Chapters across the nation mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers for immediate deployment to the disaster region. 

In the first two weeks after the storm, the Red Cross had deployed 74,000 volunteers who provided shelter to 160,000 evacuees and more than 7.5&amp;nbsp;million hot meals. More than 250 Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) were sent to provide food and water to victims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redcross.org/article/0,1072,0_312_4495,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; By September 11, 75,000 evacuees remained in 445 shelters in 19 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/katrina_facts.html&lt;/ref&gt; By that date, the Red Cross was calling for 40,000 new volunteers to relieve those who initially responded. Disaster response classes were training tens of thousands across the country. 

The [[American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund]] collected donations from the public for the relief effort. By September 28, they had raised about one billion dollars in cash and pledges, surpassing the rate of donation for the Asian tsunami and September 11 attacks. This is ten times more money than the next largest amount collected by a charity, the Salvation Army. The Red Cross estimated that its response would cost some $2&amp;nbsp;billion of which $100&amp;nbsp;million was expected to be reimbursed by FEMA, while the rest would need to come from donations. [[Yahoo!]], [[Google]] and later [[Amazon.com]] set up donation pages for the Red Cross.

As the Red Cross had raised the vast majority of donations and its response is limited to disaster aid and not to recovery, some charities suggested that the Red Cross share money with groups engaged in rebuilding efforts. 

The Red Cross received a significant{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} amount of criticism from the public, media and the government for its response to this disaster.&lt;ref&gt;http://trentstamp.blogspot.com/2006/07/new-orleans-red-cross.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|Red Cross is not in New Orleans for Katrina, Guard raced it to Superdome}}
The American Red Cross has not been allowed by Louisiana to provide aid within the city of New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redcross.org/faq/0,1096,0_682_4524,00.html#4524&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/?feed=TopNews&amp;article=UPI-1-20050909-07070700-bc-us-katrina-redcross.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amateur radio operators===

The president of the [[ARRL|American Radio Relay League]], Jim Haynie, sent a message to all [[amateur radio]] operators noting that the situation in New Orleans and other affected areas is &quot;simply too dangerous and no one is being allowed in&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2005/09/01/2/?nc=1&lt;/ref&gt;  Many media outlets say communications infrastructure is overloaded and destroyed in many places in the disaster area.  During the storm, amateur operators gave weather reports to the [[National Hurricane Center]] in Florida using HF radio.  Operators are also handling Health &amp; Welfare messages for organizations such as the [[Salvation Army]] and [[Red Cross]].  Many amateur radio organizations are staging outside the affected area getting ready to deploy into the city and suburbs.

On September 1, the [[American Red Cross]] asked the ARRL to help provide radio and amateur support for its 35 kitchens and 250 shelters.  By September 3, the ARRL had set up amateur radio operations at the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Headquarters in Montgomery Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===America's Second Harvest===

America's Second Harvest (now known as [[Feeding America]]) responded to the efforts by collecting over 33 millions pounds of food specifically for Katrina relief. Since the food bank in New Orleans was non-operational for a short period of time after the hurricane hit, a temporary warehouse was set up in [[Baker, Louisiana]]. This operation distributed food to people who were in need before the hurricane as well as people now displaced but Katrina's wreckage.

Second Harvesters Food Bank of Greater New Orleans which is a part of America's Second Harvest was operation within a few days and coordinating efforts with the staff in Baker, LA.

===Camp Hope===
[[Camp Hope]] is a volunteer camp located in [[Violet, Louisiana|Violet, LA]], which has housed volunteers in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort of St. Bernard Parish since June 1, 2006. The economic recovery of the Parish is dependent on the removal of debris to facilitate the return of both residents and businesses.

The mission of Camp Hope is to house and facilitate volunteer relief efforts in St Bernard Parish and around the New Orlean's area. Those efforts include managing and participating in the removal of health and safety hazards from properties throughout St Bernard parish with the assistance of the local, state, federal, volunteer and non-governmental agencies.

As of August 16, 2006, volunteers in St. Bernard had completed 1,668 homes in the Parish.

===Family information websites===
Several websites were set up to help family members find out information about each other in the chaos. Some include the Red Cross, The Weather Channel, local newspapers, Craigslist, and others. Yahoo set up 100 Internet-linked computers at the Astrodome and developed a meta-search of evacuee registration websites. On September 11, despite having reunited several families, the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] had a list of 1,600 children listed as missing by their parents, or who were seeking their families. 

Problems were that many survivors had no internet access, let alone electrical power, let alone computers or even computer literacy. There were also many sites so a searcher would have to go through several and sort through the many different search protocols and syntax. Another problem in theory is fraud, and another problem is that many sites only included last and first names which in a mass of several hundred thousand displaced persons obviously included many duplicates.{{or|date=December 2012}}

=== Other organizations ===
Many charities immediately began fund-raising efforts on behalf of Katrina victims and survivors.

The [[United Methodist Church]] led the way in providing volunteers to help muck out homes and rebuild affected areas.  According to the church's volunteer service arm, [[UMVIM]], over thirty thousand United Methodist volunteers have worked in the affected areas since Katrina.

[[The Salvation Army]] responded to the immidiete needs of the survivors. Eventually 5.6 million meals were served, 3.3 million people were assisted, and nearly $400 million donated. The Army’s immediate response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] included the mobilization of more than 178 canteen feeding units and 11 field kitchens which together have served more than 5.7 million hot meals, 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks &amp; drinks. Its [[SATERN]] ([[Salvation Army Team Emergency Radio Network]]) network of amateur ham-radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors. And, [[The Salvation Army]] pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals.

The New York Regional Association of Grantmakers (now Philanthropy New York) published a Donors' Guide for individuals and organizations looking for philanthropic options for Gulf Coast recovery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Red Cross, numerous charity and relief organizations stepped up their activities to aid hurricane victims. [[Southern Baptist Disaster Relief]] mobilized hundreds of units from across the US. Southern Baptist Disaster relief manned massive feeding units, shower and laundry facilities, assessment teams, Mud-Out, and chainsaw and debris removal teams across the affected area. The [[Catholic Charities]] activated a disaster response plan; areas outside of the disaster are providing refugee relief, and agencies located in or nearby are mobilizing to assist the needy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Blessing]] began organizing to ship food and relief supplies into the affected areas, as it has done in disaster zones around the world before. [[America's Second Harvest]], a [[food bank]] that operates in many communities, began coordinating efforts to ship food donations to coastal areas. [[Habitat for Humanity]] announced plans to check on all Habitat-built homes and their residents, and then turn to providing assistance to Habitat families, partners, and volunteers in need of help. The [[American Public School Endowments]] began collecting funds to rebuild schools in the affected area, and to aid schools suffering from an onslaught of refugees.  [[Mercy Corps]] is accepting donations and sending a team of emergency relief experts to the Gulf region to offer financial and technical assistance for immediate and longer-term relief and recovery efforts. [[Conservative Mennonites]] sent many volunteer laborers to help with cleaning and rebuilding of homes affected.

Other nonprofit non-governmental organizations that are helping like the [[ASPCA]] are listed on [http://www.networkforgood.org/topics/animal_environ/hurricanes/?source=YAHOO&amp;cmpgn=NEWS Network for Good]'s website. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are responding by giving much food, water, clothing, and financial aid to victims. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is also responding to the devastation.  While emergency services and rescue personnel work on relief operations in New Orleans, they are at high risk of disease.  [http://www.thefamily.org The Family International] has mobilized Christian Counsellors to provide spiritual healing, comfort and encouragement to the evacuees throughout Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi and have launched [http://www.katrinareliefhome.com Katrina Relief Home] to share the needs of the victims of this disaster.

[[Awake In America]], a [[non-profit]] organization based in [[Philadelphia]], launched &quot;Operation Restore CPAP&quot; to get equipment to treat sleep apnea in victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] who had been previously diagnosed with [[sleep apnea]].

[[Hands On USA]], now [http://www.handsongulfcoast.org Hands On Gulf Coast], was on the ground in Gulfport and Biloxi a week after the storm.  Founded in Thailand after the [[2004 Tsunami]], Hands On has evolved from immediate relief services, to recovery operations such as [[gutting]] houses and taking trees off houses, to community empowerment and redevelopment.  They are based out of the Beauvoir Methodist Church in Biloxi, MS, although they also have satellite locations in New Orleans and Bay St. Louis.

The [http://www.commongroundrelief.org/ Common Ground Collective] is a local, community-run organization offering assistance, mutual aid and support to New Orleans communities that have been historically neglected and underserved. Common Ground's efforts include acting as a hub for medical and health providers, aid workers, community organizers, legal representatives as well as people with a variety of skills. The Common Ground collective also has been part of organizing the &quot;Road Trip for Relief&quot;, a grassroots effort to bus 300 volunteers into New Orleans. 

[http://www.emergencycommunities.org Emergency Communities] is a non-profit organization that employs compassion and creativity to provide community-based disaster relief. Since Katrina, they have operated four relief sites, served over 300,000 meals and 25,000 residents of the Gulf. They are a United Way Partner Agency and currently run operations in Buras, LA and the Ninth Ward.

The Welcome Home Kitchen is serving three meals a day to over 700&amp;nbsp;people, as well as providing free medical care, a distribution center of clothing and supplies, a community bulletin board and an information table. The Welcome Home Kitchen is facilitated by [http://www.welcomehome.org/rainbow/index.html The Rainbow Family of Living Light] as well as Katrina Alliance.

[http://givingshelter.livejournal.com World Shelters Task Force One] operated in Hancock County, MS from September 15, 2005 until October 26, 2005 and deployed 80 shelter structures for relief efforts and housing.  Remaining supplies and equipment went on to be used by [http://www.burnerswithoutborders.org Burners Without Borders], with support from [http://bfi.org/node/791 The Buckminster Fuller Institute].

[[Camp restore]] began on September 10, 2006 and has since provided shelter to over 3,500 volunteers as they rebuilt hundreds of homes that had been destroyed by the hurricane.  The operation is based in East New Orleans and was started in part by the Luthern Church-Missouri Synod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/pages/rpage.asp?NavID=10814 Ross, Paula.

==International response==
{{main|International response to Hurricane Katrina}}

Initially, the United States had been reluctant to accept donations and aid from foreign countries.  However, this policy was reversed, and as the reports of damage grew more grim, the United States has now started to accept the foreign aid. Countries and organizations that offered to send aid mentioned by the State Department included [[Afghanistan]], [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Dominica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], the [[European Union]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Guyana]], [[Honduras]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Mexico]], [[NATO]], [[Nepal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand response to Hurricane Katrina|New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Nigeria]], [[Norway]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Oman]], [[OPEC]], [[Pakistan]], [[Paraguay]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Qatar]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[UAE]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[United Nations]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. Other countries not on this list have also offered aid, but the State Department mentioned that they had not been asked. Later, the US State Department said all offers were being examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these countries that helped even offered evacuees to immigrate to their respective countries. 

Notable offers from international organizations include the [[United Nations]], which was ready to send supply high-energy biscuits, generators, planes, tents along with experienced staff members; and Paris-based [[International Energy Agency]] agreeing to make 60&amp;nbsp;million barrels oil available to help the United States weather the economic problems caused by Hurricane Katrina.

==Cultural and sporting responses==
The [[National Hockey League]], along with the [[National Hockey League Players Association]], have donated [[US dollar|$]]1&amp;nbsp;million. An [[auction]] of game worn [[jersey (disambiguation)|jersey]]s, from the [[2005–06 NHL season]] opening night, will also be held.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhl.com/news/2005/09/234098.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Football League]] donated $1&amp;nbsp;million, as did the [[New York Yankees]] baseball organization.  [[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]], an hour-long, music and celebrity driven broadcast was aired on September 2, 2005 by [[NBC]].
[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]], an hour long [[simulcast]] [[benefit concert]] aired on September 9, 2005 worldwide. A four and a half-hour long benefit concert titled [[ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief]] was broadcast by [[MTV]], [[VH1]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]] on September 10, 2005. [[Céline Dion]], the Canadian singer, also donated $1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Scam artist responses==
In the wake of a large outpouring of support, many [[Confidence trick|scam artists]] took advantage of the public's willingness to provide money and other resources to victims of the hurricane. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] reported &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14683">'''Hurricane Katrina''' had many '''social effects'''. Initially, many lives were lost, while many more were disrupted. [[Hurricane Katrina]] left hundreds of thousands without access to their [[homeless|homes]] or [[unemployment|jobs]], has separated people from relatives, and inflicted both physical and mental distress on those who suffered through the storm and its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Jane. &quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9172856/ Disconnected families coping with fear, stress].&quot; ''[[MSNBC]].'' September 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displacement==
{{main|New Orleans diaspora}}
Evacuated citizens have spread to 50 states and many major cities, mostly Houston.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk of the Nation]]. &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4965553 Katrina Evacuees: Where Are They Now?].&quot; ''[[National Public Radio]].'' October 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, many people were separated from their family members, including young children separated from their parents and pets. A coordinated effort by the [[American Red Cross]], [[Microsoft]], and the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]], combined many diverse databases and has been very effective in reconnecting children with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release. &quot;[http://www.microsoft.com/citizenship/giving/katrinasafe.asp American Red Cross and Microsoft Announce New Family Linking Web site KatrinaSafe.Org].&quot; ''[[Microsoft]].'' September 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; An effort to catalog, identify, or even to collect remains of the dead is still ongoing as of April, 2006, leaving those who do not know the whereabouts of loved ones to suffer uncertainty and anxiety. Over time both the reconnection and recovery operations have improved, but it will be much time before the majority of bodies are retrieved and people reunited.

While many existing organizations have worked to help those displaced, and some new groups and special efforts have been initiated, the survivors of Hurricane Katrina are still largely unorganized. Survivors have only recently begun to form associations for their own interests in the recovery effort. The largest of these associations is the ''ACORN Katrina Survivors Association'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acorn.org/ www.acorn.org].&lt;/ref&gt; led by members of New Orleans [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN). The group has protested  [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) policies in both [[Houston, Texas]], and [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and claims over 2,000 members.
[[File:Bush Katrina Bethany World Prayer Center.jpg|right|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] visiting a family displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina]] during his September 5, 2005 visit to the U.S. Gulf Coast.]]
Many evacuees from New Orleans, facing months without income, severely damaged or destroyed homes, and little in the way of recoverable possessions have begun expressing desires to permanently resettle elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Audrey; Donato, Katharine M. &quot;[http://www.brookings.edu/printme.wbs?page=/pagedefs/8ac41814549bff3f7c45d8c70a1415cb.xml In Katrina's Wake, Who Will Return?]&quot; ''[[Brookings Institution]].'' September 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible locations include the areas to which they were evacuated, or with friends or family in other states. This would lead to potentially large demographic effects not only on New Orleans but on the entire country, rivaled only by the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of [[African American]]s in the first half of the 20th century, and the mass migration of the 1930s as a result of the [[Dust Bowl]]. The diaspora of displaced survivors is likely to endure for decades as former citizens of New Orleans resettle in other areas and yet retain strong cultural ties.

Studies have shown that the concentration of poverty is self-perpetuating, thus some postulate that the hurricane may have a small positive impact on future poverty levels.&lt;ref&gt;Hymowitz, Kay S. &quot;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-hymowitz_12edi.ART.State.Edition1.3ec70d6.html The marriage gap].&quot; ''[[Dallas Morning News]].'' March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only were evacuees displaced, but also some [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] soldiers returning home for their deployment to [[Iraq]] were displaced because they were unable to find homes upon their arrival.

==Health issues==
Aside from the lack of [[water]], [[food]], shelter, and sanitation facilities, there were concerns that the prolonged flooding might lead to an outbreak of health problems for those who remained in the hurricane-affected areas. In addition to [[dehydration]] and [[food poisoning]], there was a potential for communicable disease outbreaks of [[Cholera]] and respiratory illness, all related to the growing contamination of food and drinking water supplies in the area.

President Bush declared an emergency for the entire Gulf Coast. Before the hurricane, government health officials prepared to respond, and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) began sending medical emergency supplies to locations near the worst-hit area within 48 hours after landfall.

Supplies shipped by CDC's Strategic National Stockpile provided pharmaceuticals, technical assistance teams, and treatment capacity for citizens otherwise stranded by the hurricane's catastrophic effect on hospital infrastructure in Louisiana and Mississippi. These supplies served an estimated 30 acute care hospitals south of Interstate Highway 10, and volunteers organized around its, &quot;contingency stations,&quot; to become temporary stand-ins for hospitals, warehouses, and distribution facilities damaged by the storm. Alongside strong responses from state and local medical teams, CDC support remained crucial until normal infrastructure support began to return a week and a half later.

Within days after landfall, medical authorities established contingency treatment facilities for over 10,000&amp;nbsp;people, and plans to treat thousands more were developing. Partnerships with commercial medical suppliers, shipping companies, and support services companies insured that evolving medical needs could be met within days or even hours.

There was concern the chemical plants and refineries in the area could have released pollutants into the floodwaters. People who suffer from allergies or lung disorders, such as [[asthma]], may have health complications due to [[toxic mold]] and airborne irritants, leading to what some health officials have dubbed, &quot;[[Katrina Cough]]&quot;. In [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], several hundred tons of chicken and uncooked shrimp were washed out of their containers at the nearby harbor and could have contaminated the water table. On September 6, it was reported that ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') had been detected at unsafe levels in the waters that flooded [[New Orleans]]. The CDC reported on September 7 that five people had died of bacterial infection from drinking water contaminated with ''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]'', a [[bacterium]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Wide outbreaks of severe infectious diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]] were not considered likely because such illnesses are not endemic in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/infectiousdisease.asp  After a Hurricane: Infectious Disease].&quot; ''[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].''

==Animal issues==
[[Image:Stray dog approaching rescue worker in New Orleans following Katrina.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A stray dog abandoned by its owners approaches a rescue worker in New Orleans. Many animals were left by their owners who could not take them to the evacuation shelters.]]
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 8,000 animals were rescued and brought to temporary shelters set up at the Lamar-Dixon Exposition Center in [[Gonzales, Louisiana]], or the Parker Coliseum at [[Louisiana State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Press Release. &quot;[http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=20224 Reviewing Louisiana Animal Evacuation And Rescue].&quot; [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. November 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most helicopter pilots and rescue boat captains refused to load pets in order to hold more people. Many families in the affected area refused to evacuate without their pets. While some field hospitals allowed pets to enter with their patients, those who were evacuated from the Superdome were not allowed to take their pets with them.&lt;ref&gt;Nossiter, Adam. &quot;[http://www.recorder.ca/cp/World/050901/w090197A.html Fights and gunfire break out as New Orleans descends into anarchy].&quot; ''[http://www.recorder.ca/ The Brockville Recorder &amp; Times].'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

One case that attracted national attention was that of Snowball, a small white dog made famous by coverage of an ''[[Associated Press]]'' reporter, who said, &quot;When a police officer confiscated a little boy's dog, the child cried until he vomited. 'Snowball, Snowball', he cried.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Mary. September 1, 2005.

Accessed August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of &quot;Snowball&quot; became a centerpiece in fundraising appeals by welfare organizations and various ad-hoc websites were created by people soliciting funds to help locate Snowball and reunite him with the boy.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.katrinafoundpets.com/snowball_fund.htm Snowball Fund].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rescue teams were set up in the worst hit regions in response to desperate pleas from pet owners. Horses posed a particular problem, as they are easily stranded and cannot stand in water for long periods of time. Rescue agencies set up shelters and tried to find homes to adopt pets lost by their owners. Rescue centers were becoming overwhelmed in the days immediately following the hurricane. Several online resources were set up to give rescue groups, individuals, and businesses from around the country a centralized venue to publish their offers and requests for helping the animals displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Most of the 10,000 fish at the New Orleans [[Aquarium of the Americas]] died because the backup power ran out after four days.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/09/07/katrina.zoos/ Katrina kills most fish in New Orleans aquarium].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the marine mammals and a large sea turtle survived. The [[Audubon Zoo]] lost only three animals out of a total of 1,400 due to good disaster planning and location on high ground.

[[Humane society|The Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) in conjunction with the Louisiana SPCA and many other groups, had hundreds of staff and volunteers working in [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]]. As of September 20, 2005, 6,031 animals were rescued and 400 were reunited with their owners.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Anita. &quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-09-03-katrinapetrescues_x.htm Animal welfare groups rescue abandoned pets].&quot; ''[[USA Today]].''

==Baby names==
Katrina also had a significant impact on the popularity of the name for babies.  According to the [[Social Security Administration]], Katrina, which had ranked as the 281st female baby name in 2004, dropped down to 382nd most popular name in 2006, 600th most popular name in 2007, and 815th most popular name in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames/ Popular baby names] Social Security website, accessed May 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This surprised experts in naming trends, as past major hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969 had typically increased the popularity of a name due to its greater exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,271514,00.html 'Katrina' Sinks Lower on List of Popular Baby Names Since Hurricane Hit] Fox News May 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Many coastal towns of Mississippi (and Louisiana) had already been obliterated, in a single night.&lt;ref&gt;
   In [[Mississippi]], towns near the eye-path at night included:
   [[Pearlington, MS|Pearlington]], Lakeshore, Clermont Harbor,
   [[Waveland, MS|Waveland]], [[Bay St. Louis, MS|Bay St. Louis]],
   [[Pass Christian, MS|Pass Christian]], and [[Long Beach, MS]];
   in Louisiana, the towns included
   [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana|Buras, Triumph]],
   [[Meraux, LA|Meraux]], and [[Chalmette, Louisiana]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Hurricane-force winds reached coastal Mississippi by 2 a.m.&lt;ref name=CNN360Tuchman29/&gt; and lasted over 17 hours, spawning 11 [[tornado]]es (51 in other states&lt;ref name=NWSKat/&gt;) and a 28-foot (9 m) storm surge&lt;ref name=NWSKat/&gt; flooding 6–12&amp;nbsp;miles (10–19&amp;nbsp;km) inland.  Many, unable to evacuate,&lt;ref&gt;
   As flood waters rose, many streets became swamped and
   impassable.  Emergency crews rescued over 100 people,
   from rooftops or trees, in Mississippi.
&lt;/ref&gt;
survived by climbing to attics or rooftops, or swimming to higher buildings and trees.  The worst property damage from Katrina occurred in coastal Mississippi, where all towns flooded over 90% in hours, and waves destroyed many historic buildings, with others gutted to the 3rd story. Afterward, over 235&amp;nbsp;people died in Mississippi, and all counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas, 49 for full federal assistance.&lt;ref name=FEMA1604&gt;

Regulations were changed later for emergency centers and casinos. The emergency command centers were moved higher because all 3 coastal centers flooded at 30&amp;nbsp;ft (9&amp;nbsp;m) above sea level. Casinos were allowed on land rather than limited to floating casino barges as in 2005.

More than one million people in Mississippi were affected, and almost 6 months later, the extent of the devastation in Mississippi was still described as &quot;staggering&quot; in ''[[USA Today]]'' on February 16, 2006:&lt;ref name=HGovKatrina&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;The Mississippi Gulf Coast has been devastated.  The extent of the devastation in Mississippi is also staggering.  Since Katrina hit, more than half a million people in Mississippi have applied for assistance from [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]].  In a state of just 2.9&amp;nbsp;million residents, that means more than one in six [[Mississippi]]ans have sought help.  More than 97,000&amp;nbsp;people are still living in [[FEMA trailers]] and mobile homes.  Another 5,000 to 6,000 are still waiting for FEMA trailers.  Almost six months later, many neighborhoods are still piled high with storm debris&quot;&lt;ref name=HGovKatrina/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USATFeb16&quot;&gt;[[USA Today]], 2006-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; (reported February 2006).

==Scattered damage==
''General:'' The effects of a hurricane can be scattered across a large area, because hurricanes are large, complex storms which spawn smaller thunderstorms, tornadoes, storm surges, and sea waves.  Wind speeds east of the eyewall can be 40-50&amp;nbsp;mph (64–80&amp;nbsp;km/h) higher than winds west of the eye. Wind gusts can be scattered, just as boats or debris can ram one house but not another.  One building can seem untouched, while others nearby are flattened; also trees can be partially weakened: tree limbs can fall months later, crashing onto a roof, automobile, fence, etc.

''Specific:'' Because Hurricane Katrina became a massive storm,&lt;ref name=TCRaug&gt;

over 450&amp;nbsp;miles (720&amp;nbsp;km) wide, not only the eyewall-path, and 28-foot (9&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge, but also the [[outer bands]] of the hurricane arms caused scattered damage hundreds of miles away from the center.  Eleven (11) spawned tornadoes were recorded in Mississippi (51 elsewhere).&lt;ref name=NWSKat/&gt;
It is possible that scattered damage to northern Mississippi occurred, by spin-off storms, around the time Katrina made landfall in eastern [[Greater New Orleans]] (Louisiana's &quot;boot toe&quot;) and then, again, near [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], heading north-northeast into central Mississippi, at 10 a.m. on August 29.&lt;ref name=TCRaug/&gt;  Note that &quot;landfall&quot; occurred over towns submerged under 20&amp;nbsp;feet (6 [[metre|m]]) of water.  As buildings collapsed, water-tight appliances floated, sending refrigerators and dishwashers to ram other buildings and block streets.&lt;ref name=CNN360Marciano29/&gt;  Millions of homes and buildings were affected, along with ships, boats, and more than 40 offshore oil rigs.

Roadways and railways were put out of service by excessive amounts of debris and occasional collapse (most notably the [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge]]). Costs of debris removal in the gulf coast region is estimated at $200 million. Until major roadways ([[US Route 49|US 49]], [[US Route 59|US 59]]) could be cleared, deliverers of supplies and other emergency relief were forced to detour through highway 609 or highway 43/603, though these routes were not officially posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hurricane Katrina: Performance of Transportation Systems|year=2012|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784408797|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5470|editor=Reginald DesRoches, PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and winds intensified.  As Katrina passed 30&amp;nbsp;miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) east of central New Orleans, with 57&amp;nbsp;mph (91&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds, by 10 a.m., landfall in Mississippi increased hurricane-force winds in an area of 600,000 Mississippi residents, covering several counties (see Figure KW10: Katrina Wind Speed map):  [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]], [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]], [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River County]], [[Stone County, Mississippi|Stone]], [[Walthall County, Mississippi|Walthall]], [[Marion County, Mississippi|Marion]], [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]], [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest County]], and [[Perry County, Mississippi|Perry County]] (see Map of Counties). Other counties to see a strong hurricane force impact of Katrina were [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]], [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], [[Simpson County, Mississippi|Simpson County]], [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]], [[Rankin County, Mississippi|Rankin County]], and [[Scott County, Mississippi|Scott County]]. Katrina maintained a high wind capacity of 80–85&amp;nbsp;mph in cities like Mendenhall, Magee, Jackson, Brandon, and Forest in Mississippi. Those cities contained much tree damage, roof and patio damage, power line damage, and much thrown debris. In [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], streets were cleared off due to the intense strong winds and rains that carried throughout the entire day. During this 10 a.m. timeframe, hurricane-force winds continued over the barrier islands and Louisiana peninsula nearby; however, for the remainder of Louisiana, the winds were subsiding into gale-force winds after 10 a.m. when Katrina was becoming primarily a Mississippi hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;Note in Figure KW10: Katrina Wind Speed map, the Louisiana winds subsided (yellow/green) remaining hurricane-force mainly at the peninsula south of the eyewall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mississippi counties map Katrina disaster areas.jpg|thumb|220px|Map of Mississippi Counties, noting flood/severe damage areas (yellow shaded counties).]]

Several casinos, which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land-based gambling laws, were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wlox.com/Global/story.asp?S=5328073 WLOX-TV and WLOX.com - Building South Mississippi Together |Rumor Sometimes Becomes National News]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[MSNBC]], a 28-foot (9&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge came ashore wiping out 90% of the buildings along the [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]-[[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] coastline. A number of streets and bridges were washed away, including the bridge sections of [[U.S. Highway 90]]. In particular, the roadway portion of the U.S. Highway 90 bridge between [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]] and [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]] was completely destroyed by the storm; only the support structure was left.

The three counties most affected by the storm were [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison County]], and [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]], although almost all counties had damage, and 47 counties were declared full disaster areas.  [[Mississippi Emergency Management Agency]] 
(MEMA) officials also recorded deaths in [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds]], [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren]], and [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake]] counties. About 800,000&amp;nbsp;people through the state experienced power outages, which is almost a third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;

The three coastal counties of Mississippi, populated by about 400,000&amp;nbsp;people (almost the population of central New Orleans), had been mostly evacuated before Katrina flooded the {{convert|100|mi|km|sing=on}} region.  Katrina's storm surge was the most extensive, as well as the highest, in the documented history of the United States; large portions of Hancock County, Harrison County,&lt;ref name=CNN360Tuchman29/&gt; and Jackson County were inundated by the storm surge, affecting most of the populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;

Surge covered almost the entire lower half of Hancock County, destroying the coastal communities of [[Clermont Harbor, Mississippi|Clermont Harbor]] and [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]], and much of [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], and flowed up the Jourdan River, flooding [[Kiln, Mississippi|Kiln]]. In Harrison County, Pass Christian was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of [[Long Beach, Mississippi|Long Beach]] and [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as [[D'Iberville]], which borders [[Back Bay]].  Biloxi, on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area.

In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river [[estuary]], with the combined surge and freshwater floods cutting the county in half. Over 90% of [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]], the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, was flooded from surge.  Other Jackson County communities such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Shores were destroyed, and [[St. Martin, Mississippi|St. Martin]] was hard hit, along with [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]], [[Moss Point, Mississippi|Moss Point]], [[Gautier, Mississippi|Gautier]], and [[Escatawpa]].

Two [[destroyer]]s that were under construction at [[Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] were damaged, as well as the [[Amphibious assault ship]] [[USS Makin Island (LHD-8)|USS ''Makin Island'']].

Surveying the damage the day after Katrina's passing, Mississippi governor [[Haley Barbour]] called the scene indescribable, saying &quot;I can only imagine that this is what [[Hiroshima]] looked like 60 years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historic buildings were destroyed in Mississippi, including the cottages and second-story porches around the ''[[Beauvoir]]'' mansion, home of [[Jefferson Davis]].  Hundreds of irreplaceable Civil War-era artifacts from the Jefferson Davis home and museum were either lost or destroyed.

The lower three floors of many high-rise casinos and hotels were gutted. (See details below).

Along with countless others affected by the hurricane, U.S. senator [[Trent Lott]] lost his [[Pascagoula]] home, and the boyhood home of [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]] was also totally destroyed.

==Psychological impact==
Both the Mississippi residents who survived the hurricanes as well as the disaster relief workers who supported them are at high risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or [[PTSD]], a mental health disorder that can develop after exposure to an extreme situation such as warfare, a natural disaster or abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Warneka, T.

into the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]], where it weakened, then strengthened
into a massive Category&amp;nbsp;5 with 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h) sustained winds. Slowly turning north along the eastern coast of Louisiana, at 4 a.m. August 29, sustained winds were 132&amp;nbsp;mph (211&amp;nbsp;km/h), 90&amp;nbsp;miles (114&amp;nbsp;km) [[SSE]] of New Orleans.&lt;ref name=TCRaug/&gt;

and entering [[Tennessee]] as a tropical storm.  Despite the hurricane force centered on Mississippi, neighboring areas were also affected: when New Orleans began slowly flooding with high east/north winds, a 28-foot (9&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge eastward from [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]] devastated coastal areas with 30–55&amp;nbsp;foot (17&amp;nbsp;m) sea waves,&lt;ref name=NWSmob/&gt; flooding 12&amp;nbsp;miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) inland.  The waves pushed barges, oil rigs, ships, and debris into submerged towns to flatten many coastal buildings across to [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] with 20-foot (6 m) surge,&lt;ref name=NWSmob&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  and into [[Alabama]] with 15-foot (5&amp;nbsp;m) surge&lt;ref name=NWSmob/&gt; and 24-foot (7&amp;nbsp;m) waves battering beach houses inside [[Mobile Bay]] and tilting the battleship [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS ''Alabama'']].  (See extensive details below).

== Mississippi evacuation ==
By 4:30 a.m. CDT, on August 29, 2005, just hours before Hurricane Katrina landfall, many shelters in Mississippi were full to capacity, including many [[Red Cross]] shelters, the [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] Coliseum (which allowed pets), and five special-needs shelters.  The shelters had filled within 24 hours of opening.

Days earlier, on August 25, when Hurricane Katrina crossed the southern tip of [[Florida]], government offices in Mississippi had already discussed emergency evacuation plans for days.  On August 26, the [[Mississippi National Guard]] was activated, raising the level of concern, and on August 27, the state government activated its Emergency Operations Center, and local governments began issuing evacuation orders: the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA)&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), website: [http://www.msema.org MEMA-web].&lt;/ref&gt; advised not opening shelters in coastal counties. However, on August 28, the Red Cross also opened shelters in coastal counties, and by 7:00 p.m., 11 counties and eleven cities issued evacuation orders, a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities before the following morning, when Katrina came ashore.  Moreover, 57 emergency shelters were established on coastal communities, with 31 additional shelters available to open if needed....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[United States Congress]] | date = February 19, 2006 | title = A Failure of Initiative: Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina | pages = 60–61 | publisher = [[Government Printing Office]] | location = [[Washington, DC]] | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-04-10 |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/katrinareport/fullreport.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the evacuation was not total, many people survived the 30-foot (9 m) storm tide by climbing into the second-floor attic, or knocking out walls and ceiling boards to climb onto the roof or nearby trees.&lt;ref&gt;Unlike some suburbs, many towns in Mississippi had numerous strong trees, such as old oak trees, higher than roof-tops.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tree trunks remained standing,&lt;ref&gt;The tree trunks, after losing small branches, were narrow compared to wide walls battered by waves, boats and debris.&lt;/ref&gt; even near the beaches, where many houses were leveled.  Other people had swum to taller buildings or trees.&lt;ref name=Wavelandswim&gt;Burdeau, Cain. &quot;[http://www.wwltv.com/topstories/stories/wwl083105waveland.11adc324.html Waveland practically wiped off map by force of Katrina].&quot; ''[[WWL-TV]].'' August 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Over 100&amp;nbsp;people were rescued from roof tops and trees in Mississippi.

Although the population of the three (3) coastal counties had been nearly 400,000, and the storm tide was 20–30&amp;nbsp;feet (9 m) with coastal winds 75-120&amp;nbsp;mph (120–192&amp;nbsp;km/h), fewer than 350&amp;nbsp;people died in Mississippi during Hurricane Katrina.

== Federal buildings/projects ==
Because of federal intent to rebuild or recover projects of the US Federal Government, the damage assessment to federal buildings in Mississippi covers actual costs: the amount needed to resume operations at market costs.  The following federal projects are described in terms of damage, along with the cost to resume operations:&lt;ref name=HBrecov/&gt;

* $1.987&amp;nbsp;billion: as requested by President [[George W. Bush]], for Navy Shipbuilding and Conversion; these funds will assist [[Northrop Grumman]] to &quot;replace destroyed or damaged equipment, prepare and recover naval vessels under contract; and provide for cost adjustments.&quot;  Ships were damaged in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]].
* (unknown): as increased funding for ''[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] housing programs'' which provide subsidized loans and housing repair funding.
* $75&amp;nbsp;million: in ''wildlife habitat restoration'', for the Corps of Engineers to enhance estuarine habitats in Mississippi: following the Governor’s proposal regarding oyster reef and coastal marsh restoration. The Mississippi Department of Marine Resources will assist the Corps as these projects develop.
* $75&amp;nbsp;million: for the Corps of Engineers on various coastal projects: to accelerate completion of authorized projects along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
* $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion: to repair vital federal facilities in Mississippi, including:
:: $292.5 million for the repair and renovation of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] hospital in Biloxi.
:: $45 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport.
:: $277.2 million for the [[United States Navy]] to help rebuild the [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] base in Gulfport, and the [[Stennis Space Center]].
:: $43.4 million to help rebuild [[Keesler Air Force Base]].
:: $45 million for the Keesler Medical Center.
:: $82.8 million for new Navy housing in the Gulfport/Stennis region.
:: $324.8 million for housing at [[Keesler Air Force Base]].
:: $48.9 million for Navy housing at the [[Naval Air Station Meridian]] and at the Seabee base in Gulfport.

The cost amounts were decided for work continuing in 2006.  Note that repairs include modern renovation, since it is not feasible to assess damage in terms of restoring federal buildings to the year they were built.  However, the costs provide a condensed measure of the construction damage, without counting the millions of lost roof tiles, thousands of broken windows, etc.

== Hancock County ==
[[Image:Mississippi-Coast-towns-NOAA.jpg|thumb|380px| Coastal counties of Mississippi]]
[[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]] was the scene of the final landfall of the eye of [[Hurricane Katrina]], causing total devastation in [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]], [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]], and [[Clermont Harbor, Mississippi|Clermont Harbor]], as well as southern [[Diamondhead, Mississippi|Diamondhead]]. The bridge between Bay St. Louis and [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]] was destroyed.

Katrina's 28-foot (9 m) storm surge, and 55-foot (17 m) sea waves,&lt;ref name=TCRaug3/&gt; practically obliterated Waveland, Mississippi, and state officials said that it took a harder hit from the wind and water than any other town along the coast. Katrina came ashore during the high tide of 8:01AM,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2005 NOAA Tide Predictions: Waveland&quot; (2005), tide on 29-Aug-2005, ''NOAA'', web: [http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/get_predictions.shtml?year=2005&amp;stn=0551+South+Pass&amp;secstn=Waveland&amp;thh=%2b3&amp;thm=9&amp;tlh=%2b2&amp;tlm=49&amp;hh=*1.28&amp;hl=*1.28 NOAA-tide-tables].&lt;/ref&gt; raising the storm tide by 2&amp;nbsp;ft (0.6&amp;nbsp;m), to over 30&amp;nbsp;feet (9&amp;nbsp;m).  The storm dragged away almost every structure within one half mile of the beach, leaving driveways and walkways that went to nowhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wavelandswim&quot;/&gt; The death toll was estimated at about 50.

In Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, a foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) of water swamped the Emergency Operations Center at the [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]] courthouse, which sits 30&amp;nbsp;feet (9 m) above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;

Katrina also destroyed the first floor and dormitories of [[Saint Stanislaus College|Saint Stanislaus All Boys High School]].

The destruction brought forth by Katrina also caused about one-quarter of the [[labor force]] to lose their jobs, with the [[unemployment rate]] reaching as high as 24.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;October unmeployment&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051124/BIZ/511240366/-1/FEAT07 Miss. unemployment dips slightly].&quot; ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]].''

== Harrison County ==
[[Image:Structural Bridge Damage.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Figure BB: Damage to the Biloxi-Ocean Springs bridge.]]
[[Image:Palace Casino Biloxi Mississippi.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Damage to the riverboat Palace Casino located in Biloxi, Mississippi (MS), resulting from Hurricane Katrina.]] 

[[Harrison County, Mississippi]] was hit particularly hard by the hurricane and the storm surge. Its two largest coastal cities, [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] and [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], suffered severe damages and a number of casualties. By September 1, 126&amp;nbsp;people were already confirmed dead.&lt;ref&gt;Korosec, Thomas. &quot;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3335913 126 dead; gas, hot meals in short supply].&quot; ''[[Houston Chronicle]].'' September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller coastal towns were also severely damaged.  Much of [[Long Beach, Mississippi|Long Beach]] and most of [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]], which bore the brunt of Category 5 [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969, was leveled. Nearby Gulfshore Baptist Assembly, a camp owned and operated by the Mississippi Baptist Convention, has been permanently closed, and recommendations have been made to build a new facility elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, William H., Jr (November 9, 2006). &quot;Messengers approve record CP budget.&quot; ''The Baptist Record'' '''130''' (44): 1, 5. {{ISSN|0005-5778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tourist town of Biloxi, widespread damage was reported as several of the city's attractions were destroyed.  The lower 3 floors of many high-rise casino-hotels were gutted, as in the former [[Grand Casino Gulfport|Grand Casino]] of Gulfport, or the [[IP Hotel and Casino|Imperial Palace]] (IP Hotel and Casino) or [[Beau Rivage (Mississippi)|Beau Rivage]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]].&lt;ref&gt;Note:  see [[Beau Rivage (Mississippi)|Beau Rivage]] about 3rd-floor damage to high-rise buildings.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many restaurants were destroyed and several casino barges had been washed out of the water and onto land. Residents that survived [[Hurricane Camille]] stated that Katrina was &quot;much worse,&quot; with a storm surge reportedly reaching further inland than the previous catastrophic storm. Katrina's wind estimates were lighter than Camille's, and the central air pressure was slightly higher, but Camille was also a much smaller storm so the greater impact of the storm surge may be due to the size. [[Keesler Air Force Base]], also located in Biloxi, reported extensive damage to its facilities. Gulfport authorities reported to news station CNN that up to ten feet of water covered downtown streets. The Biloxi-Ocean Springs Bridge was also totally destroyed (see Figure BB), and [[U.S. Highway 90|US 90]] had heavy debris and severe damage to the roadbed.

Thirty of the confirmed deaths in Harrison County were at the St. Charles apartment complex, said Kelly Jakubic with the county's Emergency Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;Treaster, Joseph B.; Zernike, Kate. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/30/national/30storm.html Hurricane Katrina Slams Into Gulf Coast; Dozens Are Dead].&quot; ''[[New York Times]].'' August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The apartment complex was reported, by local news sources, to have collapsed with dozens of residents inside.  FOX News also reported deaths at the Quiet Water Beach apartments.&lt;ref name=FOXtsunami/&gt; (A later investigation by Biloxi's WLOX could not confirm any deaths at these apartments.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, Steve. &quot;[http://www.wlox.com/Global/story.asp?S=5328073 Rumor Sometimes Becomes National News].&quot; ''[[WLOX]].'' August 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Rebuilding in [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison County]] proceeded at different paces in different towns.  The town of [[Biloxi]] was greatly helped by the resurgence of the casino industry, while smaller towns such as [[Pass Christian]] did not have an economic base with which to start the reconstruction effort.  By January 2007, almost a year and a half after the Hurricane, Pass Christian had still not yet begun rebuilding its city buildings, and volunteer labor was still involved in rebuilding private homes in the town.&lt;ref&gt;The town of [[Pass Christian]] was still actively recruiting volunteers to help rebuild and clean up the city through its website &quot;[http://rebuildthepass.org/index.html Rebuild the Pass]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ECHL]] [[Mississippi Sea Wolves]], which play in Biloxi, was forced to suspend operations for two years because of the aftermath of the hurricane causing damage to the [[Mississippi Coast Coliseum]].  The team resumed play in [[2007–08 ECHL season|2007]].

==Jackson County==
[[Image:Pascagoula destroyed condos from Katrina.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Surge damage in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]].]]

In [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]], the storm surge flowed up the wide river [[estuary]], with the combined surge and freshwater floods cutting the county in half. Over 90% of [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]], the easternmost coastal city in
Mississippi, and {{convert|75|mi|km}} east of Katrina's landfall, was flooded from surge.  Other Jackson County communities such as [[Porteaux Bay, Mississippi|Porteaux Bay]] and Gulf Shores were destroyed, and [[St. Martin, Mississippi|St. Martin]] was hard hit; [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]], [[Moss Point, Mississippi|Moss Point]], [[Gautier, Mississippi|Gautier]], and [[Escatawpa]] also suffered major surge damage.

[[United States Navy]] officials announced that two [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] [[guided missile]] [[destroyer]]s that were under construction at [[Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] had been damaged by the storm, as well as the [[Amphibious assault ship]] [[USS Makin Island (LHD-8)|USS ''Makin Island'']].

==County totals==
[[Image:Mississippi counties map Katrina disaster areas.jpg|thumb|220px|right| Katrina disaster area: 49 counties for full Federal assistance (yellow shading).]]

After Hurricane Katrina, all counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas, with 49 counties eligible for full Federal assistance.  The following Mississippi counties (alphabetical order) reported deaths, tornadoes, or damage:{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

* [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]]: reported 51 deaths.
* [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]]: reported 1 death.
* [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]]: reported 12 deaths, and 2 tornadoes.

Taxpayers were eligible for automatic relief in the 49 Mississippi counties designated for individual assistance.&lt;ref name=TAdisaster/&gt;

Other counties were affected as well.

==In the region==
Since Hurricane Katrina traveled up the entire state, Mississippi lies in the center of the disaster areas for the region.  Outside the area of high winds and storm surge, other areas were affected by spin-off tornadoes and rainfall flooding.  The map below shows the declared disaster areas in the region.

[[Image:Katrina FEMA declarations narrow.gif|thumb|470px|center| Disaster areas map: dark orange indicates full assistance, light yellow-orange for Public assistance, or green for Public assistance category A/B.]]

The south tip of [[Florida]] includes damage when Hurricane Katrina originated in the [[Caribbean Sea]], dumping over {{convert|14|in|mm}} of rain in the area.

==Long-term impact==
Rebuilding of towns took years, and some areas were not restored.  The bay bridges were rebuilt taller and stronger, as had been done around [[Pensacola]] in the years following [[Hurricane Ivan]] (2004). Because all 3 Emergency Command Centers in the Mississippi coastal counties had been flooded over 30&amp;nbsp;feet (9 m) above sea level,&lt;ref name=TCRaug/&gt; the rules for command-center elevation were changed to relocate to even higher ground.  The casino-gambling regulations were changed to allow casinos to be built on land in taller buildings, no longer forcing the use of massive floating casino barges near a city, which could again become battering rams along 2nd and 3rd-story levels of nearby hotels. Celebrities who had previously visited [[New Orleans]] came to understand the massive devastation that occurred along the Gulf Coast cities.  The US [[Army Corps of Engineers]] developed plans to rebuild the protective [[barrier island]]s that had been washed out to sea along the coastal areas.  Detailed reports were written describing how people had survived by swimming to taller buildings or trees, and noting that those too old or unable to swim did not survive.  Many residents moved away and never returned.  Medical studies attempted to estimate the indirect deaths caused by people losing their homes or local medical support.

'''Canada's first response''' to the disaster inflicted by [[Hurricane Katrina]] along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline of the [[United States]] was the deployment of a [[Vancouver]] heavy urban search and rescue team, which arrived in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] on the evening of August 31, 2005, arriving on a [[WestJet Airlines]] aircraft. Due to security and logistics issues in the disaster area surrounding New Orleans, the team started operations on September 3, saving 30 people that day.  They returned to Vancouver on September 6, reportedly saving over 110 people during their deployment. It has also accepted some evacuees to stay in [[Canada]]. 

==Official Canadian government response==

The official response by the Government of Canada to the Gulf coast disaster came on September 2, following discussions between [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada]] and the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].  The federal government announced it was deploying a task force comprising three [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|warships]]&amp;mdash;{{HMCS|Athabaskan|DDH 282}}, {{HMCS|Toronto|FFH 333}} and {{HMCS|Ville de Québec|FFH 332}}&amp;mdash;along with the [[Canadian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] vessel [[CCGS Sir William Alexander|CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'']] and three [[H-3 Sea King|Sea King helicopters]] and one [[Eurocopter BO 105|BO-105 helicopter]] to the area.

The Canadian Forces also provided several [[CH-146 Griffon|''Griffon'' helicopters]] and crews to the [[New England]] States at the request of the [[United States Coast Guard]] whose search and rescue helicopters from that area have been assigned to Gulf Coast SAR operations. Canadian aircraft were deployed as part of a [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) military assistance pact.

[[Image:RCMP and US Infantry outside Canadian Embassy.jpg|thumb|left|The U.S. Infantry led by the RCMP outside the Canadian Embassy on September 7 to raise funds for Katrina victims.]]

The task force was organized under the name &quot;Operation UNISON&quot; and involved over 1,000 personnel from the Canadian Forces and Canadian Coast Guard who were placed under the operational command of their American counterparts who were coordinating relief operations.  A precedent was established with a similar humanitarian aid response by the Government of Canada following [[Hurricane Andrew]] when the Auxiliary Oil Replenishment (AOR) ship [[HMCS Protecteur|HMCS ''Protecteur'']] participated in &quot;Operation TEMPEST&quot;, providing relief supplies and personnel in southern Florida and the Bahamas.

The ships and aircraft had the capacity to relocate people and deliver a broad range of supplies, including tents, cots, water containers and items such as men's and women's toiletries, sun screen and insect repellent.  At the same time, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] was in contact with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and offered whatever support was required. &quot;We are really prepared to operate on all fronts as requested and as co-ordinated by the United States,&quot; said Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].

In an interview on [[National Public Radio]], Canada's Ambassador to the United States said that in addition to the basic desire to help a neighbor in need, many Canadians also remember the ancestors of Louisiana's Cajuns were [[Great Expulsion|expelled]] from what would become Canada by the British in the 18th century, which he felt gave an extra historical dimension to Canadians' desire to help the people of Louisiana during the recovery operation.

On September 4, following a request from U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]], the Government of [[Canada]] announced it was prepared to send thousands of beds, blankets, surgical gloves and dressings and other medical supplies. The Government of Canada announced it would also send 35 divers to help with the rescue effort. One of the divers' tasks will be to inspect levees. 

On September 5, a team of 35 military divers was deployed from [[CFB Halifax]] and [[CFB Esquimalt]] to Pensacola, Florida. They were tasked with assisting their U.S. Navy counterparts to clear navigational hazards, including unsecured and sunken vessels and debris, and to inspect flood-damaged levees. 

On September 6 the Operation UNISON task force of navy and coast guard ships departed [[Halifax Harbour]] for the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The naval ships arrived at Pensacola, Florida several days later, having been delayed by further tropical storm activity off the east coast of Florida.  The coast guard ship arrived several days later, due to its slower cruising speed.  The Operation UNISON task force unloaded relief supplies at Pensacola and was deployed to assist along the Mississippi coast.

On September 19 it was announced that the three warships from the Operation UNISON task force would be returning to Halifax, leaving the CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'' to continue its mission of clearing navigation hazards and repairing buoys.  On September 28, the coast guard vessel was retasked to assist the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in repairing the network of weather buoys along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the United States, which had been severely damaged by the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season; these buoys are one of the most important tools for forecasting and gathering data from oceanic storms.  CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'' returned to Canada on October 24.

==Other help==

[[Image:Crew of the CCG Sir William Alexander.jpg|thumb|Crew of the CCG ''Sir William Alexander'' pose for a picture shortly before arriving home after assisting in [[New Orleans]], following [[Hurrican Katrina]].]]
* The [[Canadian Red Cross]]  launched an immediate nationwide appeal for donations to enable the organization to provide aid to its American counterpart.  37 [[Canadian Red Cross]] personnel were transported by Canadian military aircraft to assist with efforts in [[Houston, Texas]]; they were followed by dozens of other Red Cross personnel once the situation assessment was completed.  The American Red Cross asked Canadian Red Cross chapters in Quebec for cots for refugees staying at U.S. evacuation centres and other services were requested from chapters in Ontario.

* The Government of [[Nova Scotia]] donated $100,000 towards the Red Cross effort.  This was followed on September 8 when the Government of [[Alberta]] announced that it was donating $5 million to the Hurricane Katrina fund administered by former presidents [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]].  The cheque was personally given by Premier [[Ralph Klein]] to former president Clinton during a visit to Alberta in October.

* Other provinces expressed interest in providing temporary housing to those left homeless.  Some residents of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] offered shelter to the homeless survivors of hurricane Katrina.  [[Anne McLellan]], the [[Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness]], announced that her department was discussing with the U.S. National Security Advisor the possibility of Canadians billeting American storm evacuees. Big cities like [[Calgary]], [[Ottawa]], [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], and [[Montreal]] accepted 1,200 evacuees in all . 

* Universities across Canada offered to take in university students from New Orleans whose studies have been interrupted.  Some institutions went so far as to offer full tuition scholarships and free room and board.

* [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario|Ontario Hydro]], [[Hydro-Québec]], and [[Manitoba Hydro]], along with other electrical utilities, sent repair crews to assist in restoring electrical power service.

* Canada increased oil exports as requested by the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] to help stabilize the world market in the wake of the crisis and its impact on North American oil production and refining capacity.

* On September 2 [[Air Canada]] participated along with U.S. member airlines of the Air Transport Association, in a voluntary airline industry initiative to support rescue and relief operations. Air Canada was the first foreign carrier to land in New Orleans delivering water and supplies and lifting victims to safety.

* On September 7, the Canadian Embassy started a Hurricane Katrina fund to support victims in the Gulf region.  [[Frank McKenna]], Canadian ambassador to the United States, told Americans &quot;you are our friends and together we are family &amp;ndash; you do not suffer alone.&quot;

[[France]] was one of the first nations to offer aid to the [[United States]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. On August 31, French officials expressed their condolences to their American counterparts: [[President of France|President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] wrote a letter to [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], and the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], wrote to [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]]. 

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] refused French assistance initially, but on September 2, Rice said that the U.S. authorities would assess the situation and contact French authorities accordingly. On September 4, French assistance was formally requested. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its disaster relief stocks located in the [[Martinique]], including 600 tents, around 1000 beds, 60 electrogenic groups, three pumps, three [[water purification]] stations, 1000 folding [[jerry can]]s, and other supplies. 

A 35-man team of the [[Sécurité Civile]] from [[Guadeloupe]] and  Martinique were ready, including 11 hurricane specialists, and a 60-man &quot;catastrophe intervention&quot; airmobile detachment could be ferried from mainland in a short time. These men are of the [[Ministry of the Interior]].

The Ministry of Defence offered two planes already in the hurricane zone, and six more from mainland France, two ships of the [[French Navy]] (probably the [[BATRAL]] ''[[FS Francis Garnier|Francis Garnier]]'' or ''Champlain'', and the frigate ''[[FS Ventôse|Ventôse]]'') and a 20-man emergency medical team.

The non-governmental organisation [[Télécoms Sans Frontières]] and the company [[Véolia Environnement]] have offered their services in communications and water management, respectively. The [[French Red Cross]] has put 12 logisticians at the disposal of the [[American Red Cross]].

Planes were ready from September 5, but take-off was delayed by a few dozen hours because the U.S. authorities did not provide information about where they wanted aid to arrive. The French ambassador in [[Washington, D.C.]] insisted that this information be given as soon as possible [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/actu/bulletin.asp?liste=20050906.html#Chapitre2] and the French Embassy issued a number of press releases [http://www.consulfrance-atlanta.org/katrinaus.htm] and a list of governmental and private efforts ([http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/statmnts/2005/katrina_humanitarian_aid.pdf PDF]).

On September 7, an [[Airbus Beluga]] from [[Toulouse]] with 12.7 tonnes of material (notably nine tents (25m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each), 50 tents (4x4m each), 40 cover rollers and 170  8x12m covers, 300 folding jerricanes, kitchen sets) flew to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], after a brief stop in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to load more food. 2 [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA|CASA]] airplanes from Martinique landed in [[Little Rock]] the same day, ferrying tents, covers and 1000 rations of food for one day. The equipment was ferried on roads.

[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/05/300&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en] 

On September 8, further requirements were issued by the USA for divers and forensic experts.

On the 21 October 2005, US authorities formally thanked French officers with a reception given at the US embassy in Paris [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/pix/b/eur/55453.htm].

== French victims of Katrina ==

As of September 9, no French citizen was reported killed by the hurricane. Assistance was given by the team of the consulate of New Orleans to 40 French citizens.

Two missions were working: 
* One mission from [[Atlanta]] was working in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] and Mobile, visiting homes to locate French citizens.
* Another was in New Orleans, attempting to contact any French citizen still there.

Furthermore, teams were in [[San Antonio]] and [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] to locate French citizens among the refugees. Four physicians were available.

The French [[consul]]ate in New Orleans was temporarily moved to [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3478">[[Image:Lockheed C-130 Hercules.jpg|thumb|right|A [[C-130 Hercules]] cargo aircraft]]

[[Sweden]] received on September 1, 2005, in the immediate aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a general plea for disaster aid from the [[United States]]. The [[Swedish Rescue Services Agency]] made a formal offer of help through the Swedish Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the Swedish government granted the Rescue Service Agency clearance to render assistance.

On September 2, awaiting a formal request from the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], the Rescue Service Agency prepared a [[C-130 Hercules|Hercules cargo aircraft]] filled with three complete [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] systems, first aid kits, blankets, [[Combat ration|ready-to-eat meal]]s, generators, and 2 large water purification plants. The capacity of the water plants would provide 15,000 people with 7 litres water per day. Included was a five member expertise team.

Having yet to receive a formal request, the Swedish agency scheduled the plane to leave on September 4, but on Sunday, the U.S. declined the aid, saying it was currently unable to accept foreign aid packages. However, the U.S. State Department had not formally declined the country's help. The Swedish Rescue Services Agency stated that they would have the aircraft ready for immediate deployment upon receiving permission from the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]].

On September 7, Harry Thomas, coordinator for foreign aid at the U.S. State Department, publicly denied reports that the Rescue Service Agency was waiting with a plane on the ground in Sweden for flight clearance in the U.S., and had not heard from Washington. Claes Thorson, a spokesman at the Swedish Embassy in Washington said, &quot;There is a lot of stuff offered, but we are having a problem getting it over,&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/JFUA-6G23NN?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/07/news/relief.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, the plane left [[Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport]] for the United States carrying a payload of three [[Ericsson]] [[Network Switching Subsystem|GSM network]] systems. A team of technical consultants to help with the aid package was also provided.

On August 30, 2005, [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Vicente Fox]] sent his condolences to [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]: &quot;In the name of the people and of the government of Mexico, I assure you of my deepest and most sincere condolences for the devastating effects caused by Hurricane Katrina&quot;. 
He also mentioned his instructions to the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs; that the [[United States]] would be provided with any kind of help that was needed.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} Fox later stated to the people of Mexico: &quot;Mexico and the United States are neighboring countries and friends that must support each other in times of crisis. My thanks to you all and let us all keep supporting these efforts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fox message&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas received almost 196 Mexican troops, 14 truckloads of water, a mobile surgical unit, 45 military vehicles, 3 tons of purified water, and more than 250 tons of food, bottled water, canned food, disposable diapers and medical supplies. The Mexican Government sent $1 million through the [[Mexican Red Cross]] which collected an additional million, as well as 200 tons of food delivered in five airplanes from the Mexican Air Force by another Mexican Government body. The Mexican Navy sent two ships, eight all-terrain vehicles, seven amphibious vehicles, two tankers, two helicopters, radio communication equipment, and medical personnel.  Mexican aid workers set up temporary headquarters in the [[Houston Astrodome]] to assist relief workers and hurricane victims were very grateful for the aid that the Mexicans provided. The Mexicans provided hot meals to evacuees and relief workers, and Mexican medical teams also deployed into local area hospitals to tend to the influx of evacuees who flooded San Antonio area hospitals.

The medical team consisted of three doctors, three dentists, three nurses and three paramedics. They conducted 134 medical evaluations, performed 526 medical consultations, provided 363 ambulatory nursing procedures, and medically evacuated 83 personnel during their hurricane relief mission.  They also offered to cover the costs of returning Mexican nationals back to Mexico. Also offered were teams of epidemiologists to reduce the risks of infections caused by mosquitoes.

The Mexican [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] sent four rescue experts from the state of [[Jalisco]] to assist in rescue efforts in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. The government of the [[Mexican Federal District]] also pledged to help with relief efforts.

On  September 4, the [[Mexican Navy]] offered ships, buses and helicopters to assist in rescue missions. The offer was accepted and the Mexican ship ''[[USS Newport (LST-1179)|Papaloapan]]'' departed from Tampico, with two [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17]] helicopters, eight all-terrain vehicles, seven amphibious vehicles, two tankers, radio communication equipment, medical personnel and 250 tons of food.&lt;ref&gt;Fox message&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, the Secretariat of Social Development pledged 200 tons of food, to be delivered in five airplanes by the [[Mexican Air Force]].

The Secretariat of National Defense, on September 6, sent Mexican soldiers with expertise in rescue missions to the area affected by Katrina. Also sent the same day were 35 vehicles and 162.7 tons of food, carried by trucks traveling through the state of [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;5th U.S. Army&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of congress of the Federal District pledged a day of salary each on September 7, to be sent to those affected by Katrina. The National Commission of Water sent bottled water and canned food upon request. Naval ship ''Papaloapan'' arrived the same day, with 389 soldiers and other personnel from the Mexican Navy. Units of the [[Military of Mexico|Mexican Army]], a total of 184 people, arrived by land with 35 military vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Denton/AP&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, the Mexican Army was received with honors at [[Kelly Air Force Base]] by the mayor of [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Local news channels noted the fact that the Mexican Army operated on U.S. soil after 159 years of absence, with the last time being the [[Mexican-American War]].

==End of mission==

On September 25, the 184 person Mexican army contingent completed its 20 day long mission to provide relief to hurricane victims and relief workers from Katrina and Rita. The Mexican Army's field kitchen, a tractor-trailer turned into a kitchen, served 170,000 meals during their deployment to the former Kelly Air Force Base. They also assisted in the distribution and management of more than 184,000 tons of supplies.

On September 26, 2005 in a small ceremony conducted by the Mexican consulate, the Mexican troops ceremonially ended their mission. They broke down their camp, packed their equipment, folded their flag and drove back to Mexico. Not since the 1840s has the Mexican military flown its flag as a deployed military force in the United States, especially so close to the site of the famed battle of the Alamo where Texan volunteers fought the Mexicans in a bloody 13 day siege.

Following that devastation of the [[United States]] Gulf Coast by [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] of [[Singapore]], [[Lee Hsien Loong]], sent a letter to US President [[George W. Bush]] promising support for the American people in their relief effort in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

In his letter, Lee wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''&quot;The thoughts of Singaporeans and me are with you and the American people whose lives have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. America has always been generous in helping others in their time of need. We in Southeast Asia have experienced that, most recently during the tsunami relief operations. Singapore is happy to reciprocate in a small way by participating in your efforts to save lives and restore normality to your people.&quot; ''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relief operations==
[[Image:RSAF Chinook.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] committed four [[CH-47 Chinook]] helicopters and 45 personnel toward the relief effort in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]].]]
On 1 September, the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] (RSAF) sent three [[CH-47 Chinook]] helicopters to [[Louisiana]] to assist in relief operations. The three aircraft were based at the [[Peace Prairie]] Singapore training detachment of the [[Texas Army National Guard]]'s [[149th Aviation Regiment (United States)|149th Aviation Regiment]] in Grand Prairie AASF, [[Grand Prairie, Texas]]. They arrived in [[Fort Polk]], [[Louisiana]] in the afternoon of 1 September to aid rescue operations mainly in resupply and airlifting missions.

Thirty eight RSAF personnel, comprising pilots, aircrew and technicians were also deployed. The Singapore team worked with the [[Texas Army National Guard]] in the relief efforts.

On 5 September, a fourth Chinook helicopter was sent to help in the relief operations, and the number of personnel deployed increased to 45.

Throughout the Singaporean relief effort, the four Chinooks flew 61 sorties. They transported hundreds of evacuees from flooded areas to safety, especially from the [[Louisiana Superdome]] and [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]]. They also picked up stragglers around the New Orleans area. The Chinooks carried a total of 540 tonnes of equipment, humanitarian aid, cargo, and supplies and rescued over 800 evacuees. They were involved in moving sand bags to block up the broken [[levee]]s.  The number of aircraft sent exceeded that of all other foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Helicopter Operations: Hurricane Katrina | url = http://www.helis.com/featured/katrina.php | publisher = helis.com | date = 6 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSAF Detachment Commander of Peace Prairie, Lieutenant-Colonel Kevin Rodrigues, said his men were in high spirits and remained focused in their mission.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

American Ambassador to Singapore [[Frank Lavin]] said the American people were deeply grateful for Singapore's help. He added that RSAF personnel were saving lives in Louisiana and that the other Gulf Coast States and Americans would long remember this.

The RSAF’s Peace Prairie detachment has worked together with the Texas Army National Guard on other relief missions in the past, including relief operations in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Floyd]] in [[North Carolina]] in 1999 and fire-fighting and flood relief operations in [[Texas]] in 2000.

During Hurricane Katrina, the [[Singapore Red Cross]] launched a public appeal to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. It requested donations from Singaporeans to the emergency so that the fund could be used to assist displaced and homeless victims through the [[American Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Singapore Red Cross Launches a Public Appeal to Help Victims of Hurricane Katrina | url = http://www.redcross.org.sg/new_hurricanekatrina_appeal_m.htm | publisher = Singapore Red Cross | date = 6 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''&quot;Singapore and Katrina&quot;''==
American [[Op-Ed]] columnist for the ''[[New York Times]]'' [[Thomas Friedman]] wrote an article ''Singapore and Katrina''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Thomas Friedman]] | title = Singapore and Katrina | date = September 14, 2005 | publisher = [[New York Times]] | pages = A29 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/opinion/14friedman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting on the American government's management performance after the hurricane, which he felt was slovenly and compared poorly to Singapore's governance. He cited among others [[Kishore Mahbubani]], dean of the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] who said ''&quot;... You lose New Orleans, and you have 100 other cities just like it. But we're a city-state. We lose Singapore and there is nothing else. ... &quot;''.

Commentators have discussed the likely effects of the disaster on a wide range of political issues.

==Political controversies and electoral consequences==
Political disputes have arisen over several issues:

===Issues relating to the cause of the damage to New Orleans===
{{Main|Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans}}
*Whether the flood protection designed and built by the federal US Army Corps of Engineers was mis-engineered and should have held back the storm surge.  This issue is complicated by a) the design goals given to the Corps of Engineers by state officials decades past did not request a 100-year flood level protection (which is nearly ten times as costly as a 50-year flood protection), and b) that over-topping of earthen levees will destroy them in a short time by their very design (this is not considered a &quot;failure&quot; by definition), but much more costly concrete levees should not fail in such situations without impact damage from debris which is possible, even under the water line.  &quot;Holding back the storm surge&quot; is only possible for well-maintained levees of appropriate height and strength... the taller the levee, the more it can hold back, and the more it costs to build and maintain.  The variation of weather and maintenance budgets makes finding the appropriate &quot;threshold&quot; difficult.  Due to this &quot;cost efficiency / diminishing returns&quot; factor, and the weather forecasting ability the primary protection for any flood situation is the proper evacuation of flood-prone areas in a timely manner.
*Whether loss of coastal wetlands resulted in increased flooding further inland.  This question was also brought up by the Mississippi Flood of 1996 which was blamed not only on excessive rainfall, but the extensive levee building along the river which attempted to reclaim flood plains for fertile farming area.  Channeling flood waters via levees will increase storm surge height, and previous levees built may not be tall enough after surrounding areas develop levees.  This debate plays directly into the fact that the lower 9th ward itself is a reclaimed wetland/swamp raising flood risk for others around Lake Pontchartrain, raising the ethical issue of rebuilding/pumping out the 9th ward after its flooding.
*Whether lax state environmental regulations for the storage of [[toxic]] [[chemical]]s has increased the contamination of flood waters.

===Issues relating to government response===
{{Main|Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina}}

===Long-term issues===
*Whether the US Army Corps of Engineers needs reform in their design and construction policies
*Whether Congress needs reform in the way flood protection projects are chosen and funded
*Whether policies that affect the poor, such as [[bankruptcy]] legislation, should be changed to make it easier for those in poverty to recover from such a disaster. 
*If [[electoral district]] changes will be necessary due to large migration of displaced people (e.g. reducing Louisiana's electoral college votes, and how many congressmen they may contribute to the House of Representatives).
*The question of exclusive government assistance / compensation funds should be available to Katrina/Rita survivors similar to the funds set up for 9-11 survivors or whether existing social nets are sufficient.

==Policies affecting hurricane defenses==

===Prevention and evacuation issues===
According to the [[National Response Plan]], the Department of Homeland Security &quot;will assume responsibility on March 1 [2005] for ensuring that emergency response professionals are prepared for any situation. This will entail providing a coordinated, comprehensive federal response to any large-scale crisis and mounting a swift and effective recovery effort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/theme_home2.jsp]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many critics have noted that while Mayor Nagin gave a mandatory evacuation order on August 28, before the storm hit, they did not make sufficient [[hazard prevention|prevention]] and provisions to evacuate the homeless, the poor, the elderly, the infirm, or the [[car]]-less households. Hospitals, nursing homes, group homes, were supposed to have pre-determined evacuation and/or refuge plans in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf page II-3]{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreign nationals without transport claimed that the police refused to evacuate them, giving bus places only to American citizens.

Despite this, 90% of Greater New Orleans was evacuated- the most successful and complete evacuation of a US city since the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1562517,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Townsend | title=You're on your own, Britain's victims told | date=September 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, on August 27 the White House issued a statement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050827-1.html Statement on Federal Emergency Assistance for Louisiana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; effective August 26, authorizing federal emergency assistance for Louisiana.  The statement authorized the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief and &quot;...required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the parishes of Allen, Avoyelles, Beauregard, Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Caldwell, Claiborne, Catahoula, Concordia, De Soto, East Baton Rouge, East Carroll, East Feliciana, Evangeline, Franklin, Grant, Jackson, LaSalle, Lincoln, Livingston, Madison, Morehouse, Natchitoches, Pointe Coupee, Ouachita, Rapides, Red River, Richland, Sabine, St. Helena, St. Landry, Tensas, Union, Vernon, Webster, West Carroll, West Feliciana, and Winn.&quot;  This includes all the parishes in the state of Louisiana except the coastal parishes which are inherently exposed to the most destructive forces of a hurricane. The President had not yet authorized FEMA to enter the coastal areas despite the governor's request including those parishes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.state.la.us/Press_Release_detail.asp?id=973{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor activated the National Guard with her August 26, State of Emergency Declaration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf, page II-4]&lt;/ref&gt; Red Cross relief in New Orleans remains forbidden by the Governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/08/katrina.redcross/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com - Red Cross: State rebuffed relief efforts - Sep 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Louisiana Evacuation plan, evacuation was mainly left up to individual citizens to find their own way out of the city.  It was known that many residents of New Orleans lacked cars. It is also believed that many citizens, having survived previous hurricanes, did not anticipate the impending catastrophe and chose to ride out the storm. Even so, a 2000 census revealed that 27% of New Orleans households, amounting to approximately 120,000&amp;nbsp;people, were without privately owned transportation. Additionally, at 38%, New Orleans has one of the highest [[poverty]] rates in the United States. These factors may have prevented many people from being able to evacuate on their own. Consequentially most of those stranded in the city are the poor, the elderly, and the sick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/index.pl?issue=20050902 Democracy Now! | September 02, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0902-02.htm Amid Stench of Death, Poor Bear the Brunt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bus yard-rotate.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of flooded New Orleans school buses.]]

State and city evacuation plans (&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part 1 Section C and part II-2) mention use of school buses for evacuation. With the following language: &quot;The primary means of hurricane evacuation will be personal vehicles. ''School and municipal buses, government-owned vehicles and vehicles provided by volunteer agencies may be used to provide transportation for individuals who lack transportation and require assistance in evacuating.&quot;''  Several hundred school buses were left parked on low ground where they would be easily flooded with storm water and then later by the levee flooding making their use impossible in the emergency evacuation. It is not clear whether these buses were owned by the city or by a private contractor to which the city had outsourced school bus services. Mayor Nagin testified in his hearing in Washington that those buses were owned by the school board and that he had no control over them. The precise number of buses available has been cited anywhere from a few hundred&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Department of Education: [http://www.doe.state.la.us/lde/uploads/2253.pdf Total number of buses].  2003 upload, data for Orleans county shows 324 available buses.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Times-Picayune'': [http://web.archive.org/web/20050919071715/http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf?/base/news-10/1120800316204660.xml RTA buses would be used for evacuation.]  July 08, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; to a likely exaggerated 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Times'': [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/sep/6/20050906-122931-2126r/ Not much traction with the abuse.]  September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

During non-emergency times, drivers of [[school bus]]es must own and maintain a class D commercial license or better depending on the exact size and weight of the bus.  During an emergency any driver is suitable as long as approved by the Governor. In spite of risks and his lack of formal training or license, 20-year-old [[Jabbar Gibson]] commandeered a New Orleans school bus and rescued 70&amp;nbsp;people from the rising floodwaters before making the 13-hour drive to Houston's [[Reliant Astrodome]], arriving on Wednesday evening.&lt;ref&gt;http://images.chron.com/content/news/photos/05/09/01/katrina_renegadebus.jpg{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/casey/3335904&lt;/ref&gt; A day later a commercially licensed driver's bus filled with evacuees flipped, resulting in one death and many injuries after a passenger fought with the driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050903/NEWS05/509030307 The Daily Advertiser - www.theadvertiser.com - Lafayette, LA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a phone call to WWL radio made after the idle school and RTA buses were flooded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/02/nagin.transcript/ | work=CNN | title=CNN.com - Mayor to feds: 'Get off your asses' - Sep 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Nagin called for 500 Greyhound buses to be sent from outside the city to help evacuate.  Coordination of transportation from outside the Parish is the responsibility of the Governor according to the State Evacuation Plan (Part 1 Section D).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Governor [[Kathleen Blanco|Blanco]] had yet to exercise this responsibility.

Some evacuees report that the drive from New Orleans to Baton Rouge took anywhere from five hours to nine hours; this drive usually takes up to an hour. Reports from the Associated Press state that 80% of the near 500,000 had evacuated safely from New Orleans prior to the hurricane's landfall. Even if licensed drivers had been available and the available buses had been used to evacuate the remaining approximately 150,000&amp;nbsp;people, they may not have made it to safety before landfall.

This massive migration is the largest since the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s sent about 300,000&amp;nbsp;people from the Great Plains States to other regions of the U.S., most notably California.

===New Orleans flood defenses===
Early questions arose on why the flood protection system designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers failed catastrophically in 53 different places in metro New Orleans.

In 1965, with passage of the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]], the United States Congress gave the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) the Federal responsibility for the design and construction of the flood protection in Greater New Orleans in the Pontchartrain Hurricane Protection Project, subject to appropriations and local participation, some of which was later waived.  Local municipalities were designated the responsibility for maintenance once the projects were complete (source: GAO testimony summary attached).

When authorized, this Congressional mandate was projected to take 13 years to complete.  When the flood protection system failed in 2005, the project was between 60-90% complete and the projected date of completion was estimated to be 2015, nearly 50 years after it first gained authorization from Congress.

The levees themselves were designed to protect New Orleans from a direct hit by a Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane.  This decision was made by the Corps decades ago &quot;based on a cost-benefit analysis&quot;, according to Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, USACE's [[Chief of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-050901corps,1,7189346.story?coll=chi-news-hed&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true | work=Chicago Tribune}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Hurricane Katrina passed east of New Orleans, it was a weakening Category&amp;nbsp;4 storm.

Questions have been raised about proper funding for the Corps of Engineers, which is in charge of many hurricane-protection programs across the United States.  [[Sidney Blumenthal]], from the Clinton Administration, appeared as a guest on [[BBC]]'s ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'' on September 1, 2005 stating that the Bush Administration had specifically diverted tens of millions of US dollars in the Corps of Engineers from water and storm protection efforts to be used instead by the Corps in Iraq.  As a result, Blumenthal said, the Corps had performed only last-minute and substandard reinforcement of levees, some of which subsequently failed. 
In February 2005, following in the tradition of past presidents, President Bush proposed cutting the Corps' budget by 7%, and in 2004 proposed a 13% cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050901/ap_on_go_pr_wh/katrina_bush_budget]{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other questions have been raised about the design of the flood protection system itself.  While the Corps has admitted fault for the failure of the 17th Street, London Avenue and Orleans Avenue outfall Canals, reports by the National Science Foundation/U.C. Berkeley and Team Louisiana cite inadequate design throughout the entire levee system.

New Orleans' emergency operations chief, Terry Ebbert, who worked with Mayor Ray Nagin before the hurricane and was part of the decision team which delayed the evacuation of the city standing thousands in New Orleans was later cited saying, &quot;This is a national disgrace. We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims, but we can't bail out the city of New Orleans,&quot; referring to the US [[Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake#Americas|humanitarian relief]] for the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/katrina/story/0,16441,1561561,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Bush under fire over hurricane aid | date=September 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal wetlands policy===
There has been criticism of the federal policy, since 2003, of again turning [[wetland]]s over to developers. 

Louisiana has a long history, under both parties, of approving private developments in [[wetlands]] with consequent destruction of wetlands across coastal Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/special/NewHistoricalland.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Wetlands create friction and reduce high winds when hurricanes hit. They also absorb hurricane storm surges. Scientists estimate that every 2.7&amp;nbsp;miles of wetlands absorbs one foot of storm surge.&quot;

The Bush Administration, contrary to campaign promises and a wetland protection policy maintained since 1990, ended federal wetlands protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/katrina/story/0,16441,1561356,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sidney | last=Blumenthal | title=Sidney Blumenthal: Katrina comes home to roost | date=September 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm surge that overcame New Orleans and the surrounding parishes would have been drastically reduced had wetlands been present to reduce said surge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050905/full/050905-11.html] {{Verify source|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political effects of population displacement==

In the days following the evacuation of New Orleans, [[Reuters]] reported that &quot;[i]nterviews with refugees in Houston, which is expecting many thousands of evacuees to remain, suggest that thousands of blacks who lost everything and had no insurance will end up living in [[Texas]] or other U.S. states,&quot; and ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'' notes that &quot;those left homeless will take part in the biggest internal migration of people since the days of the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/home_asia/2005/09/01/hurricane-katrina-economic-impact-cx_0901katrinaland.html | work=Forbes | title=Storms In The Gulf | date=October 21, 2005}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This and other reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-050901migration,1,12681.story?coll=chi-news-hed | work=Chicago Tribune}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2005/09/05/black_resettlement20050905.html | work=CBC News | title=Could Katrina damage prompt huge wave of black migration? | date=September 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the hurricane will have demographic consequences, particularly in and around Louisiana. Prior to the hurricane, Louisiana was one of a handful of states projected by the [[U.S. Census]] department to become a [[minority-majority state]] within the next two decades. Because a majority of displaced Louisiana residents are black, this occurrence will likely be delayed in Louisiana, but accelerated in nearby [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Texas]].

It has been noted that the displacement of a significant portion of African Americans from Louisiana is likely to shift the politics of that state in a more conservative direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/11/katrina.politics.ap/index.html | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Louisiana may also lose a vote in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] following the [[2010 U.S. Census]].

==Effects on the structure of government==
===FEMA funding and leadership===
Many local emergency managers defended FEMA, pointing out that the Bush Administration has since 9/11 reduced the agency's budget, mission, and status. FEMA, which was elevated to cabinet-level status under [[Bill Clinton]] and later incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security, which placed high priority on counter-terrorism and disaster preparation. Some members of the [[International Association of Emergency Managers]] had predicted that FEMA could not adequately respond to a catastrophe due to the integration and staffing overlaps. President Bush was criticized for appointing [[Michael D. Brown]] as FEMA head. Prior to joining FEMA, Brown had no experience in disaster relief and had even been fired from his previous job as a supervisor of judging at the [[International Arabian Horse Association]]. After closer scrutiny prompted by FEMA's coordination efforts with local officials before Hurricane Katrina, it was found that Brown had &quot;mis-represented&quot; several of his credentials which lower staffers had not discovered when vetting him for Presidential appointment to his position. FEMA funding was affected by Hurricane Katrina by the proposal and passage of the [[Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act]], which requires states seeking FEMA assistance to accommodate pets and service animals in their plans for evacuating residents facing disasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/shays/news/2005/september/PETS.pdf Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act] House of Representatives website. September 2005. Accessed August 30, 2007.{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.03858: H.R.3858] Library of Congress. Accessed August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy matters arising during the recovery==
===Reports of contract awards===
[[Halliburton]] received reconstruction and damage assessment contracts for naval facilities in Mississippi and New Orleans affected by Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/business/3335685]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kellogg Brown &amp; Root]], a former subsidiary of [[Halliburton]], is doing major repairs at Navy facilities along the Gulf Coast that were damaged by the hurricane. That work is being done under a $500&amp;nbsp;million contract with the Defense Department. 

Other [[no-bid contract]]s were awarded to the [[Fluor Corporation]], a disaster recovery specialist company based in southern California, and [[The Shaw Group]] of Baton Rouge, La.  Shaw is a client of [[Joe Allbaugh|Joe M. Allbaugh]], a consultant with extensive emergency disaster training and was a former FEMA director. Shaw's CEO was chairman of Louisiana's Democratic party at the time. On 2005-09-13, officials vowed investigation of possible fraud and waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/national/nationalspecial/14spend.html | work=The New York Times | first=Philip | last=Shenon | title=Official Vows Investigation of No-Bid Relief Contracts | date=September 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shaw Group disclosed, in its annual report filed on July 5, that it is the subject of what the company describes as an &quot;informal inquiry&quot; by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], and as policy regarding any investigation, the SEC declined to comment. Federal securities class-action cases accused the Shaw Group and its executives of defrauding investors with misleading statements concerning the company's finances and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/2005-09-14-katrina-contracts_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Kevin | last1=McCoy | title=Contracts raise controversy | date=September 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the ''Wall Street Journal'' (9/12/05), other companies that had received no-bid [[cost-plus contract]]s included Bechtel National, the government services arm of [[Bechtel Corporation]] which would provide temporary housing, Denver-based [[CH2M Hill]] Cos. which would provide housing, and Kenyon Worldwide Disaster Management which would collect human remains. FEMA has primary responsibility for spending more than $50&amp;nbsp;billion in aid, 60 times its budget in 2003 in a relatively short time-frame to facilitate quick response to the disaster.

The Shaw Group, Inc., which won two federal rebuilding contracts, each worth $100&amp;nbsp;million, has a history of obtaining no-bid contracts through contacts to Democratic politicians in Louisiana. &quot;Shaw's chief executive officer, Jim Bernhard &quot;is the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Shaw Group Inc., a Fortune 500 company,&quot; and Chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party. The Shaw group and Jim Bernhard is/was also a major supporter and contributor to Gov. Blanco and other Major Louisiana Democrat politicians.

Many commentators immediately began discussing [[global warming]] in the wake of the hurricane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1099102,00.html | work=Time | first=Jeffrey | last=Kluger | title=Is Global Warming Fueling Katrina? | date=August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; with increased debate that global warming significantly increases the number and intensity of extreme weather events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=5444&amp;method=full]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/09/01/katrina.warming.ap/ | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The United Nations (UN) scientists responsible for the UN Global Warming report have categorically denied Global Warming had any impact on hurricane strength or frequency in the past fifty years.  US weather reports and UC-Berkley scientists collaborate this finding.

Even more fanciful speculation asserted the hurricane was [[Hurricane Katrina as divine retribution|divine retribution]] for any of a number of provocations, including politically issues such as the [[War in Iraq]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/05/front2453615.183333333.html]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, (most famously by New Orleans' own mayor [[Ray Nagin]] in a 2006 MLK day [[Chocolate City speech|speech]]), and U.S. pressure for the [[Israel]]i withdrawal from [[Gaza]] and domestic issues such as [[abortion]], and tolerance for [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/featured/20050831_thank-god-for-katrina.html]{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3338642]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45449">:''This article covers the levee system and infrastructure repairs in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] following [[Hurricane Katrina]].''
{{Katrina}}

Though [[Hurricane Katrina]] did not deal the city of New Orleans a direct hit on August 29, 2005, her storm surge precipitated catastrophic failures of the [[levee]]s and flood walls.  The [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] (&quot;MR-GO&quot;) breached its levees in approximately 20 places. The major levee breaches in the city include the [[17th Street Canal]] levee, the [[London Avenue Canal]], and the wide, navigable [[Industrial Canal]], which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Verity. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4307972.stm Fixing New Orleans' thin grey line].&quot; ''[[BBC News]].'' October 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While ownership, definition of requirements, operation and maintenance of the system belonged to the [[Orleans Levee Board]], federal responsibility for New Orleans' flood protection design and construction belongs by [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federal mandate]] to the US Army Corps of Engineers.

Flooding from the breaches put the majority of the city under water for days, in many places for weeks. The [[Army Corps of Engineers|Corps]] made emergency repairs to breaches and pumps worked at draining the city. [[Hurricane Rita]] brushed the city nearly a month later, causing reflooding of some areas, most significantly from water flowing through incompletely repaired levee breaches.

==Background==
[[Image:17StCanalLakewardFromMetarieRd.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A portion of the 17th Street Canal, looking lakeward from behind the Metarie Road Pumping Station. Note the levees topped with concrete flood walls.]]
{{main|Drainage in New Orleans}}
Flooding due to rain and storms has long been an issue since the New Orleans' early settlement due to the city's location on a [[river delta|delta]] [[marsh]], much of which sits below sea level. The city is surrounded by the [[Mississippi River]] to the south, [[Lake Pontchartrain]] to the north, and [[Lake Borgne]] to the east. Construction of the levees along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. The levees were originally designed to prevent damage caused by seasonal flooding. Today, the [[Flood wall|floodwall]]s atop the 17th Street and [[London Avenue Canal]]s are used for drainage, to pump water from the city streets out to Lake Pontchartrain. These floodwalls are one foot (300&amp;nbsp;mm) wide at the top and widened to two feet (600&amp;nbsp;mm) at the base. The visible portion is a concrete cap on steel sheet pile that anchors to the wall.  [[Retaining wall|Sheet pile]]s are interlocked steel columns, in this case at least 30 feet (10 m) long, with 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) visible above ground; examinations afterward showed that some pilings were not as deep as specified. The wide, navigable [[Industrial Canal]] is used for shipping.

The heavy flooding caused by [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965 brought concerns regarding flooding from hurricanes to the forefront. Congress removed responsibility from the state and mandated that the US Army Corps of Engineers have sole authority over the design and construction of the New Orleans area flood protection, although local cooperation was stipulated. This is spelled out in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fws.gov/habitatconservation/Omnibus/R&amp;HA1965.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Forty years later when Katrina struck, the flood protection was between [[Flood Control Act of 1965|60-90% completed]] with an estimated completion date of 2015, despite the initial expectation of completion within thirteen years.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao.gov&quot;&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d051050t.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 2005, work in Orleans Parish was certified as 90% complete, with &quot;some work remaining&quot; along the London Avenue Canals, and 70% complete in Jefferson Parish.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao.gov&quot;/&gt;

There were many predictions of hurricane risk in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina in August, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jim. &quot;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282151.html New Orleans is Sinking].&quot; ''[[Popular Mechanics]].''

May 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' published a story which predicted that a severe hurricane striking New Orleans, &quot;would strand 250,000 people or more, and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under {{convert|20|ft|m}} of water. Thousands of refugees could land in Houston.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Eric. &quot;[http://www.hurricane.lsu.edu/_in_the_news/houston.htm Keeping its head above water: New Orleans faces doomsday scenario].&quot; ''[[Houston Chronicle]].'' December 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Many concerns also focused around the fact that the city's [[levee]] system was only designed for hurricanes of no greater intensity than [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 3]].&lt;ref&gt;Westerink, J.J.; Luettich, R.A. &quot;[http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/ceonline03/0603feat.html The Creeping Storm].&quot; ''Civil Engineering Magazine.''

November 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out, Katrina was Category 3 when it made landfall and most of New Orleans experienced Category 1 or 2 strength winds. However, due to the slow moving nature of the storm in its pass over New Orleans, several floodwalls lining the shipping and drainage canals in New Orleans collapsed and the resulting flood water from Lake Ponchartrain inundated the city within the two days following the storm, causing costly damage to buildings and resulting in many deaths.

Furthermore, the region's natural defenses, the surrounding [[marshland]] and the [[barrier island]]s, have been dwindling in recent years due to human interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;gonewater&quot;&gt;Bourne, Joel K. &quot;[http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0410/feature5/ Gone with the Water].&quot; ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].''

==Levee repairs==
===Pre-storm preparations===
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina wind swath.gif|thumb|Strength of Katrina's winds. (NOAA)]]
On Saturday, August 27, while Katrina was a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] storm gathering strength in the Gulf of Mexico, the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] Mississippi Valley Division was preparing and posturing elements from as far as [[Hawaii]]. Anticipating the possibility of a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] storm placing water in New Orleans, preparations began for drainage operations.&lt;ref&gt;News Release. &quot;[http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/hurricane/news/Katrina%20NR%2005-16.pdf MVD prepares for Katrina].&quot; ''[[US Army Corps of Engineers]].'' August 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2005, as Katrina made its [[Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina|second and third landfalls]] on the [[Louisiana]]-[[Mississippi]] coast, Corps District Commander, Col. [[Richard Wagenaar]], and a team worked out of an emergency operations shelter in New Orleans. Other teams waited in the storm's path across the Gulf coast. 

The Corps worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, Army National Guard and other state and federal authorities to bring in all assets available to expedite the process. &quot;We're attempting to contract for materials, such as rock, super sand bags, cranes, etc., and also for modes of transportation like barges and helicopters, to close the gap and stop the flow of water from [[w:Lake Pontchartrain|Lake Pontchartrain]] into the city,&quot; said Walter Baumy, Engineering Division chief and project manager for closing the breach.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson-Evans, Catherine; Keating, Phil; Leventhal, Rick; Shively, Caroline;Smith, Shepard; Springer, Dan. &quot;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,167633,00.html 'This Is Our Tsunami'].&quot; ''[[Fox News]].'' August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flooding===
[[Image:NOAA Katrina NOLA 17th Street breach Aug 31 2005.jpg|thumb|Breach in 17th Street Canal floodwall in New Orleans, Louisiana, August 31, 2005. (NOAA)]]

Corps' engineers initially believed that water in the 17th Street Canal overtopped the floodwall, scoured behind the wall, and caused it to collapse. But three local fire captains confirmed with video footage the floodwall failed before water reached the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwltv&quot;&gt;[http://www.wwltv.com/local/stories/wwl062006khvideo.a430c449.html News for New Orleans, Louisiana | Local News | News for New Orleans, Louisiana | wwltv.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The floodwall breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge.

There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the [[Lower Ninth Ward]], between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue.  The [[London Avenue Canal]] breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge.

By the evening of August 29, 2005, approximately 28 levee failures were reported throughout the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;breaches&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5200940 Timeline: Who Knew When the Levees Broke].&quot; ''[[National Public Radio]].'' February 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 66% to 75% of the city was now under water. Wind and other storm damage had already stopped the city. Many power lines were down and the remains of trees and buildings blocked streets.

As Corps of Engineers' workers began working with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) begin work on city cleanup and civil engineering tasks, several boats surveyed the flooded areas and blocked waterways around the city. Corps of Engineers used crane barges to remove barges that had been washed atop bridges and other structures.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://bbsnews.net/index.php?topic=katrina&amp;page=5 Army Corps of Engineers Marks Halfway Point in Unwatering Mission].&quot; ''[http://www.bbsnews.com/ BBS News].'' September 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans were made to begin levee work, including the placement of 3,000 pound sand bags on the 17 Street Canal. Army National Guard helicopters began assisting in this operation August 31. Meanwhile, Lake Pontchartrain started slowly draining and was expected to return to normal levels in about 36 hours.

===Recovery===
[[Image:New Orleans 17th Street Canal filling.JPG|thumb|Building roadway toward 17th Street Canal breach. (USACE)]]
The breach at the 17th Street Canal Levee, a levee-floodwall combination, was found to be about 300 feet (100 m) long. The Corps began operating on an initial hypothesis that the force of the water overtopped the floodwall and scoured the structure from behind and then moved the levee wall horizontally about {{convert|20|ft|m}}.  This hypothesis was later refuted by eye witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwltv&quot;/&gt;

The Corps released two contracts to close the breach in the 17th Street Canal. The 3,000 pound sandbag operation at the 17th Street Canal was postponed early in the day when U.S. Army [[w:CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] helicopters were diverted for rescue missions. The Corps continued to coordinate with Army officials to have helicopters assist in the placement of sandbags at the breaches. The 3,000 pound sandbags were each about {{convert|3|ft|m}} square (1 m).

Corps officials worked with Orleans Parish and Louisiana Department of Transportation officials and Boh Brothers Construction Company, headquartered in New Orleans, to place piling at the lakefront to stop the flow in the 17th Street Canal. This would stabilize the water flow and allow work on the levee, while also helping to stabilize the rest of the levee system.

Along with local and state officials, the Corps contracted to build access roads to the breach sites and to fill in the breaches. Rock/stone/crushed concrete was hauled in by truck for road construction and repairing the breaches. One plan called for building an access road from Hammond Highway to the 17th Street breach, and then southward to the end of the breach.

To assist in draining the city, the Corps delivered two 5,000 cubic feet per second (140 m³/s) pumps to the Louisiana Superdome.

===Construction===
[[Image:New Orleans USACE Flexifloat DSC 0157.JPG|thumb|Flexifloat barge delivers 15,000 pound sand bags to plug a breach in the 17th Street Canal. (USACE)]]
With Lake Pontchartrain almost back to normal levels, little water was flowing out of the city. This allowed a change of plans, and marine equipment was used to drive sheet piling at the mouth of the 17th Street Canal to seal off the entire canal from the lake.

Shortly after 1:00 p.m.&lt;!--1pm of what day? (May 2009)--&gt;, the first piece of sheet piling was driven, to form a steel wall across the lake's entrance to the 17th Street canal. A contractor began bringing in rock to build a road toward the breach, which was south and east of the Hammond Highway bridge over the canal, with dry land on the west side of the bridge.

Rock was being transported from offsite to complete the access road and closure at the 17th Street breach. Once the rock required to build the roads arrived in New Orleans and the access road to the breach was completed, the Corps estimated closure of the breach could be completed in three to four days. Several private firms have volunteered services and provided assistance in design of the closure.

Similar work was planned for sealing a {{convert|300|ft|m|sing=on}} London Avenue breach, although in that case materials would come from demolition of Lakeshore Drive. Five {{convert|42|in|mm|sing=on}} pumps were ordered to assist in draining the city.

The 17th Street Canal Levee, was now estimated to have a breach 450 feet (150 m) long. It was still believed that water overtopped the floodwall, scoured the structure, and then moved the structure 20 feet (6 m) horizontally.

Work continued on nearby waterways, including several locks which were closed. Use of some of the locks required raising bridges. The Industrial Canal Lock needed repair, and its lockmaster raised the St. Claude Avenue bridge, but lowered it because of hostility from civilians wanting to cross on both sides.

===Water flow stopped===

By September 1, 2005, the mouth of the 17th Street Canal had been sealed with the sheet piling preventing lake water from getting to the levee breach. Since no additional water can get through the breach it was no longer necessary to seal the breach itself. The next step was to get existing pumps working, and to bring in additional pumps to drain the surrounding city and the canal. Later, the canal was drained so that permanent repairs could be made to the levee. To allow drainage, backhoes mounted on marsh buggies and draglines mounted on barges cut breaches in some other levees. Marsh buggies are tracked vehicles whose wide tracks enable them to operate in soft, marshy terrain.

Helicopters were dropping large sandbags made of strong, synthetic materials in the breach. Heavy equipment on the ground has been placing rock. Ground access was created by building a rock road from Hammond Highway, which is about 700 feet (200 m) lake-ward of the breach. The 17th Street Canal is a drainage canal whose dimensions and an important bridge, integral to the flood control system, would not permit entry of barges and towboats to haul rocks and placement cranes.

A [[pump station]] began pumping out about 5,000 cubic feet per second (140 m³/s) at the Industrial Canal. One pump was working in New Orleans East. At this point, the process of removing water was estimated to take 36 and 80 days, according to Brig. Gen. Robert Crear.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/02/sitroom.03.html Transcript of The Situation Room: Aftermath of Katrina].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' September 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 3, 2005, the first of the five new pumps were delivered. Four more pumps have been loaned to the Corps by St. Charles Parish.

===Breach closed===
[[Image:New Orleans USACE-17th Canal-A-09-04-05 0004.JPG|thumb|300px|The 17th Street Canal stretches southward between Jefferson and Orleans Parishes in this aerial photo taken Sunday, September 4. (USACE)]]
By September 5, 2005, the 17th Street Canal breach was closed. [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]] and Chinook helicopters had dropped over 200 sand bags, with approximately 125 sandbags breaking the surface of the water. After the emergency is over, plans called for the canal to be drained and the wall repaired.

There were three 42&quot; mobile pumps staged and two 42&quot; and two 30&quot; pumps were placed at the sheet pile closure. Sewer &amp; water board, electric utility and the [[249th Engineer Battalion (United States)|249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power)]] were completing pump house inspection. When the pumps began operation, a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} opening was made in the sheet piling to allow water to flow out of the canal.

===Pumping and moving on===

[[Image:New Orleans London breach repair.jpg|thumb|250px|London Avenue breach. (USACE)]]
By September 6, 2005, the pump stations began to get online on 17th Street Canal. Pump Station 10 was actually pumping at this point. Pump Station 6 was interrupted to clean up some debris out of the area. Pump Station 1, which is a little bit further up in the system, was pumping to Pump Station 6, so as to drain the upper area, uptown areas. Over on the east side, Pump Station 19 had been running for some time. Two of the three big pumping stations in New Orleans East were running, in addition to temporary pumps. At least one pump station was running in Plaquemines Parish.

It was decided to use sheet pile closure to stop water flow at the London Avenue breach, similar to what was done at 17th Street Canal. A rock wall had initially been built there. The London Avenue canal was drained so that the breach can be repaired.

Portable pumps were used to remove water from the city. The estimated area of flooding was reduced to 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Heather; Arthur, Bill. &quot;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&amp;sid=ajDuXYPGm9_Y&amp;refer=top_world_news New Orleans Levees Patched, Army Starts Pumping Water (Update6)].&quot; ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]'' September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; By late Tuesday afternoon, 3 of the 148 permanent pumps had been restored to operation. Important steps in returning more pumps to operation include repairing breaches in the London Avenue and Industrial canals. Repair of the London Avenue breach was estimated to require two weeks. Steps in repairing the Industrial canal breach include removal of two damaged barges and one that had sunk.

On the morning of September 7, 2005, approximately 60% of the city was still under water. Blackhawk helicopters continued to deliver 7,000 pound sandbags to London Avenue. Sandbagging operations continued 24 hours a day. The Corps expected to close two breaches at the London Avenue Canal within 24 hours. Employees and contractors were temporarily using sandbags to close these holes.

Several small breaches caused by the storm had been found and were being closed. Draining the city was estimated to take anywhere from 24 to 80 days. Volunteers from as far as Germany and the Netherlands offered to assist with pumps and generators.

Engineers found two breaches on the east side of the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal and one on its west side. They closed the larger of the two breaches on the east side yesterday and filled the smaller of the two breaches with clay and stone. Work will begin on the west side as soon as feasible.

23 of the 148 permanent pumps had now been restored to operation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, Bill. &quot;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aVL0UBIleXKQ&amp;refer=us New Orleans Allows Forced Evacuation; Probe to Start (Update6)].&quot; ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]'' September 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Three pumps were operating at the 17th Street Canal, discharging water at around 2,250 cubic feet per second (64 m³/s).  Pump station 19 at the Industrial Canal, just north of Florida Avenue, was pumping 1,300 cubic feet per second (37 m³/s). Pump station 8, located in St. Bernard Parish in the vicinity of St. Mary, was running at full capacity at 837 cubic feet per second (24 m³/s).&lt;ref name=&quot;updatesep6&quot;&gt;News Release. &quot;[http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/hurricane/news/6sep05_mvd_2.pdf Corps of Engineers' update to Hurricane Katrina response].&quot; ''[[US Army Corps of Engineers]].''

By this time, approximately 100 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers workers were in New Orleans. Over 500 contracted workers were involved in repairs.

By September 8, 2005, of the 174 pumps now in New Orleans area, 37 were operational, extracting water at a rate of {{convert|9,000|cuft/s|m3/s}}.

September 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, officials were wary of operating the pumps at full capacity because of the possibility of damaging newly repaired levees and of losing corpses.&lt;ref&gt;Mishra, Raja; Cullen, Kevin. &quot;[http://www.boston.com/news/weather/articles/2005/09/09/new_orleans_gains_in_cleanup_water_removal/ New Orleans gains in cleanup, water removal].&quot; ''[http://www.boston.com/ Boston.Com]'' September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By Friday, September 9, 2005, 32 of 148 existing pumps in New Orleans proper were operating, pumping 11,282 cubic feet per second (319 m³/s), and 38 portable pumps were operating, pumping 734 cubic feet per second (21 m³/s). In addition, 9 of 26 existing pumps in [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]] reported operating at 1,360 cubic feet per second (39 m³/s). It was estimated, based on average seasonal rainfall, that [[Orleans Parish, Louisiana|Orleans Parish]] would be drained by the week of October 2, 2005. [[Orleans East]] and [[Chalmette Parish, Louisiana|Chalmette]] would be drained by the week of October 8, 2005, and [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]] would be drained by the week of October 18, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;News Release. &quot;[http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/hurricane/news/6sep05_mvd_2.pdf Corps of Engineers' update to Hurricane Katrina response].&quot; ''[[US Army Corps of Engineers]].'' September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By Saturday, September 10, 2005, there were 148 organic pumps in the New Orleans area being worked, with an average of 26 permanent pumps operating, pumping 9,125 cubic feet per second (258 m³/s) and 39 portable pumps were operating, pumping 723 cubic feet per second (20 m³/s).&lt;ref name=&quot;beginrecovery&quot;&gt;News Release. &quot;[http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/katrina/neworleans1.html Corps overcomes huge hurdles: New Orleans begins to see results of recovery operations].&quot; ''[[US Army Corps of Engineers]].'' September 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, nine of 26 existing pumps in [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]] reported operating at 1,360 cubic feet per second (39 m³/s).  The equivalent to an Olympic-sized swimming pool was being drained every two seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;beginrecovery&quot;/&gt;

===Final critical breach closed===
The fourth and final critical breach in the Orleans and East Orleans areas was closed. A roadway had been built, at the rate of 500 feet (150 m) a day, from the 17th Street Canal work area to reach the London Avenue Canal breach.  From the London Avenue west side breach, the road was built to the second breach area at Mirabeau Road.

As at the 17th Street Canal, at the London Avenue Canal the flow from Lake Pontchartrain into the canal had been cut off. Corps contractors drove 150 of feet (50 m) of steel piling across the canal to seal it.

[[United States National Guard|Texas Army National Guard]] Chinook and Blackhawk helicopter crews had placed an average of 600 7,000-pound sandbags each day into the breaches. Depending on the helicopters lift capability, Corps riggers averaged one to three hookups every two minutes during daylight hours. Sandbagging operations ran 24 hours for ten days and, with the breaches complete, were halted September 10.

Several crane barges were also used to place sandbags and gravel, and other barges were used to haul equipment, pumps, generators and people to sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;beginrecovery&quot;/&gt;

By Sunday, September 11, 2005, the number of operating pumps had been raised to 74 of 174, with the high capacity Pumping Station 6 expected to be returned to service within days. Officials lowered the estimated maximum amount of time required to unwater New Orleans to 40 days, or late October, 2005.

By September 12, 2005, water had overtopped the temporary breach closure at the London Avenue Canal because of operations at Pump Station 3. This caused the canal to rise faster than the temporary pumps at the end of the canal could drain. Operations at Pump Station 3 were immediately stopped and a few sheet piles were removed to allow the canal water level to equalize.

===September 13===
[[Image:New Orleans 17th Street Canal water line.jpg|thumb|250px|Water has receded by 17th Street Canal. (USACE)]]
For nearly a week, Plaquemines Parish floodwaters were receding naturally through three breaches and a deliberate notch. The unwatering operation was getting results approaching {{convert|14,000|cuft/s|m3/s}} pumping out of Orleans, East Orleans and St. Bernard parishes. In the 17th Street Bridge area, watermarks on homes showed evidence of at least a six-foot drop in water levels. In Plaquemines Parish, five of ten permanent pumps are pushing over 4,100 cubic feet per second (116 m³/s). 27 of 104 permanent pumps and 43 temporary pumps were running, pushing more than 13,000 cubic feet per second (368 m³/s) out of the metropolitan New Orleans area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ninebillion&quot;&gt;News Release. &quot;[http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/hurricane/news/13_sept_tf_unwatering.pdf Over the nine billion gallon mark in daily draining: New Orleans water continues to recede over a foot per day].&quot; ''[[US Army Corps of Engineers]].'' September 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corps crews in Saint Bernard Parish cut the roadway at Highway 48 to allow drainage to Pump Station 8. At Pump Stations 1, 4, 6 and 7, the Corps installed booms or floating oil barriers to protect facilities from oil hazards. The Corps continued to monitor the area. Crews also installed a temporary roof at Pump Station 7, enabling the station crew to begin necessary maintenance. The unwatering mission in [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]] was expected to be completed within the next week.

In East Orleans, four more portable pumps were to be added in support of Pump Station 15 to increase the overall capacity to 1,100 cubic feet per second (31 m³/s). For the first time, the Jahncke Pump Station ran at its full capacity of 1,200 cubic feet per second (34 m³/s). Citrus Pump Station and St. Charles Pump Station each were running at half capacity because the Citrus Pump Station has to pull power from a generator at one of the other two stations. Total possible capacity for these two stations is 1,750 cubic feet per second (50 m³/s).

The Corps cleared the rock dike at Lake Shore Drive, removing sheet pile, and raising wire sheet to allow Pump Station 3 to continue pumping at a high rate. Corps personnel were monitoring both breach sites at London Avenue Canal around the clock.

Corps contractors were expected to complete the road to the second London Avenue breach the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ninebillion&quot;/&gt;

===Halfway done===
By September 15, 2005, the inundation of the city had been reduced from 80% to 40%, although flooded areas were not expected to be habitable for a long while. In [[Orleans Parish, Louisiana|Orleans Parish]], most of the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans]] and the southern part of Orleans Parish were dry enough for normal recovery operations to begin. Water remained in the northern part of the parish and would be pumped out using Pump Stations 12 and 4, and reinforced with about a dozen temporary pumps. Pumping efforts in the lower Ninth Ward were removing water at a rate of {{convert|12|e6USgal|m3}} per day. Some construction work continued on the 17th Street and London Avenue canal breaches where helicopters were precision-placing 7,000-pound sandbags to reinforce existing repairs and crews were armoring sandbag closures with rock. Contractors maintained cranes at the sites to regulate flow levels by adjusting sheet pile walls at the mouths of the canals into Lake Pontchartrain. Construction of the access road to the second London Canal breach north of Mirabeau bridge was completed September 14. St. Bernard’s Parish was almost completely dry, with the only significant water remaining in the Chalmette extension. However, recovery in St. Bernard’s Parish was limited by the spill of petroleum products from local oil facilities. In Plaquemines Parish, repairs to the levee breaches continued and were almost ready for full scale pumping of the affected areas. Most of the fixed pumping stations in Plaquemines Parish had survived the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;halfway&quot;&gt;News Release. &quot;[http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/hurricane/news/14_sept_corps_marks_halfway_point_.pdf Inundation cut from 40 to 80 percent: Corps marks halfway point in unwatering mission].&quot; ''[[US Army Corps of Engineers]].'' September 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of pump repair efforts shifted from Pump Station 1, which was now operating, to Pump Station 4 in Orleans Parish. On September 15, {{convert|7.5|e9USgal|m3}} of water was pumped out of the city. The previous day’s estimate of {{convert|11.8|e9USgal|m3}} was not reached because one of the main pumping stations was running out of water to pump and most pumps in St. Bernard’s Parish were off because of successful mission completion. It was estimaged the overall effort would be completed in early October.&lt;ref name=&quot;halfway&quot;/&gt;

From a ground survey, the Corps had identified nine breaches that must be repaired to provide a minimum level of protection to the affected parishes. Of these, seven had been repaired to date, one was being used to allow drainage to leave St. Bernard’s Parish and one was being addressed in Plaquemines Parish. Additionally, levees had been deliberately notched at two sites in St. Bernard's Parish to facilitate the unwatering mission. Of these, one had been closed and one was still in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;halfway&quot;/&gt;

* Breach on 17th Street canal in Orleans Parish. Repaired.
* Northern breach on London canal in Orleans Parish. Repaired.
* Southern breach on London canal in Orleans Parish. Repaired.
* Northern breach on the IHNC in Orleans Parish. Repaired.
* Southern breach on the IHNC in Orleans Parish. Repaired.
* Breach in St Bernard's Parish. Not repaired – water is flowing out naturally.
* Three breaches in Plaquemines Parish. Two repaired.

On the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, Corps contractors used crane barges to remove two barges from “atop” the Florida Avenue Bridge, also commonly known as the L&amp;N Bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;halfway&quot;/&gt;

===September 18===
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers performed a detailed assessment of about {{convert|350|mi|km}} of hurricane levee and developed a comprehensive, prioritized plan to repair it and the pumping stations that support New Orleans and surrounding areas. &quot;The system in its present condition does not ensure that the city will be protected from flooding resulting from storms or hurricanes,&quot; stressed Col. Duane Gapinski, Task Force Unwatering commander. Gapinski said that residents could be placing their lives and property at risk by re-entering flooded areas until additional emergency levee repairs are made. State and local leaders were informed as assessments are being completed and repairs are made.&lt;ref name=&quot;assessment&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/hurricane/news/18_sept_new_orleans_recovery.pdf News Release].&quot; ''[[US Army Corps of Engineers]].'' September 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery of New Orleans was seen as a three-phase process: first and most immediate, to unwater the city and assess flood protection. Second, to provide an interim level of protection to get the city through hurricane season and later high water, and over the long-term, to return the system to pre-hurricane conditions. This will take a tremendous amount of study, research, funding and construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;assessment&quot;/&gt;

The Corps estimated the New Orleans area was more than 80 percent unwatered. Corps officials estimated the overall unwatering effort, given normal seasonal rainfall, would be completed no later than early October, 2005. [[Hurricane Rita|Tropical Storm Rita]] was being closely watched at this point. Additional traffic in the city in the past three days had caused some delay in traveling to work sites and moving emergency repair equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;assessment&quot;/&gt;

===Preparation for Hurricane Rita===

By September 21, 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers had begun closing two damaged canals at noon in preparation for storm surges associated with [[Hurricane Rita]]. The 17th Street and London Avenue Canals were closed with steel sheet piling by evening and remained closed until the threat of severe weather passed. Steel sheets would be driven deep into the canal beds near Lake Pontchartrain, providing protection from possible storm surges from the lake rushing into the damaged canals.

More than 800 filled sandbags were on hand, and an additional 2,500 ordered. Work continued around the clock to make emergency repairs to damaged canal walls and levees.

===Hurricane Rita's flooding===

By September 23, 2005, although high water caused by Hurricane Rita flowed over the temporary closure on the Industrial Harbor Navigation canal, the structure remained intact. This reflooded part of eastern New Orleans.

===November and December===
[[Image:SandbagRowLowerLondonBreech.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A row of sandbags behind the lower London Avenue Canal breach fails to keep water from flowing into neighborhood streets in early November 2005.]]
The Corps continued work into November and December 2005 on filling the breaches in the London Avenue and 17th Street canals, as water continued to seep through the temporary breach repairs into streets.

===Completion of temporary repairs===
By January 2006, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that temporary repairs of the Industrial, London Avenue, and 17th Street Canals had been finished. A project for more permanent repairs started.

===Future improvements===
In January 2007, the Army Corps of Engineers, after having visited the extensive [[Delta Works|&quot;Delta Works&quot; levee system]] in the [[Flood control in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], awarded a $150 million contract to a group of Dutch engineering companies for the evaluation, design and construction management of levees and floodwalls, special closure structures for protection of the communities adjacent to the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, major pumping facilities and planning studies for improved levels of flood protection for New Orleans and southern Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arcadis/Bioengineering Group contract&quot;&gt;Infrasite.net &quot;[http://www.infrasite.net/news/news_article.php?ID_nieuwsberichten=6203&amp;language=en&amp;refresh=1]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Delta Works are a series of constructions built between 1953 and 1997 in the southwest of the Netherlands to protect a large area of land around the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]] from the sea. The works consist of [[dam]]s, [[sluice]]s, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], levees, and [[flood gate|storm surge barriers]]. The works were initiated after the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] in which 2,170 people were killed.

Since Katrina, the US, through the Army Corps of Engineers, has made a $14.45 billion investment in the area around New Orleans. Some of the projects include:[http://155.76.147.200/hps2/pdf/Facts_%20Figures_Web_12_08_09.pdf]

* The world's largest water pump station ([[Gulf Intracoastal Waterway West Closure Complex]]) which can pump {{convert|1|e6USgal|m3}} per minute and will cost $1 billion. [http://westclosure.com/projectoverview.php]
* Hundreds of levee and pump station improvements. [http://www.nolaenvironmental.gov/nola_public_data/projects/usace_levee/docs/original/IER29_NOEastPubMtg8_13_09.pdf]
* The [[IHNC Lake Borgne Surge Barrier]], the longest storm surge barrier in the United States
* The [[Seabrook Floodgate]], a floodgate at the connection of [[Lake Ponchartrain]] with the [[Industrial Canal]]

==Bridges, Roadways, and Railways==
Approximately 45 bridges were damaged by some aspect of the hurricane. Several major bridges were among the worst damaged, with the [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge]] as the most catastrophic failure with over 470 spans separated from their supports and nearly 65 fallen completely into the water. Other vital bridges damaged enough to impede traffic included the [[Pontchartrain Causeway]], [[St. Louis Bay Bridge]], and [[Biloxi Bay Bridge]].&lt;ref name=DesRoches&gt;{{cite book|title=Hurricane Katrina: Performance of Transportation Systems|year=2012|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784408797|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5470|editor=Reginald DesRoches, PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mississippi railways and roads, when not affected by bridge collapsing, were disrupted due to heavy debris. Removal costs are estimated at $200 million for that area. Damage to the Louisiana roadway systems was mostly due to washouts and has been deemed minimal. &lt;ref name=DesRoches /&gt;

==Other infrastructure repair==

On Monday, September 5, 2005, electrical power began to be restored to buildings in the central business district of New Orleans on a priority basis.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, Mark; Simao, Paul. &quot;[http://today.reuters.com/business/newsarticle.aspx?type=tnBusinessNews&amp;storyID=nN04639018&amp;imageid=2005-09-05T215039Z_01_NOS304_RTRIDSP_2_KATRINA.jpg&amp;cap=Bao%20Nguyen,%2054,%20explains%20the%20damage%20done%20to%20his%20home%20in%20Metairie,%20a%20suburb%20of%20New%20Orleans,%20September%205,%202005.%20On%20Monday,%20residents%20were%20allowed%20back%20to%20their%20homes%20for%20the%20first%20time%20since%20Hurricane%20Katrina%20struck.%20REUTERS/Shannon%20Stapleton WRAPUP 7 - Katrina death toll may be 10,000, Bush vows help].&quot; ''[[Reuters]].'' September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; By Thursday, September 8, [[Entergy]] had restored 9 of 17 electricity generating units in the New Orleans area to service. Entergy's 1000 MW Waterford and Watson plants were still out of service, with the Watson plant expected to require 6–12 weeks to repair. By Friday, electrical power had been restored to 11% of New Orleans customers. Also, officials were organizing to have work begin as soon as Monday, September 12, to rebuild the, &quot;[[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|twin spans]]&quot; [[Interstate 10|I-10]] bridge to New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.klfy.com/Global/story.asp?S=3830665 Power figures, news on I-10, other notes on Katrina recovery].&quot; ''[[KLFY-TV]].'' September 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, September 6, 2005, the [[Port of New Orleans]], the largest U.S. port in terms of tonnage handled, was able to receive and service relief ships. It was estimated that resumption of commercial shipments would take at least 14 days.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Rip. &quot;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=adNXIjdn4Z8Q&amp;refer=canada New Orleans Port Opens to Relief Ships After Katrina (Update1)].&quot; ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]'' September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By Wednesday, September 7, 2005, safe drinking water was available in some West Bank areas, including [[Algiers, Louisiana|Algiers]] and the [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] suburbs, and some water pressure was available in New Orleans for fire fighting. All sewage from the city was flowing untreated into the Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Don. &quot;[http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050908/NEWS01/509080366/1002/NEWS Displaced official in Shreveport helps restore water service in New Orleans].&quot; ''[[Shreveport Times]].'' September 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lower Mississippi River]] was open during daylight hours to shallow draft traffic and deep draft vessels less than 39 feet (12 m). A contractor removed obstacles in the Southwest Pass, which was restricting deep draft navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;updatesep6&quot;/&gt;

The [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]] reopened on Monday, September 12, 2005, to cargo traffic, with limited passenger service expected to resume Tuesday, September 13, 2005.

Officials awarded a [[United States Dollar|$]]30.9 million contract to repair the, &quot;twin spans&quot; [[Interstate 10|I-10]] bridge to New Orleans to Boh Brothers Construction Co. on September 12, 2005. It was estimated that 45 days would be required before the bridge could reopen to normal traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/sep2005/2005-09-12-02.asp First Steps on the Hard Road to Environmental Restoration].&quot; ''[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ Environment News Service].'' September 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Water pressure had now been restored in the majority of the [[Jefferson Parish]]. A &quot;boil water&quot; order was still in force on the East Bank, but had been lifted for the West Bank. On the East Bank, 17% of sewage pumps were operational, and 39% were operational on the West Bank.

On Tuesday, September 13, 2005, the [[Mississippi River]] upstream of [[Head of Passes]] was declared open by the [[United States Coast Guard]]. The Head of Passes &amp;mdash; 95 miles (153&amp;nbsp;km) downriver from New Orleans as measured from [[Algiers Point]] &amp;mdash; is where the river branches off into separate passes into the Gulf. The only part of the river operating under any restrictions was from the main stem of the Mississippi River channel through Southwest Pass to the Gulf. That section was limited to daylight traffic. The Coast Guard continued restoring [[Aids to Navigation]] (AToN) to allow night transits, giving first priority to those AToNs described by pilots as being most critical.

The [[Gulf Intracoastal Waterway]] was opened from [[Texas]] to [[Florida]] using Baptiste Collette Bayou as an alternative to the IHNC. The GIWW reach from Baptiste Collette to Pascagoula was limited to 9.5' draft, versus the 12' authorized. Caution was recommended for transit.

The [[Industrial Canal Lock|Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (IHNC) Lock]] became operational but was still not operating due to bridge closures and sunken barges, the removal of which was anticipated to take until mid-week.

The [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] was closed to deep draft vessels. The inland portion was serving as an alternative route to the GIWW due to closure of the IHNC for shallow draft vessels. Preliminary surveys indicated a controlling depth of 27'.

Port Fourchon sustained significant damage, but was operating to a limited extent. Sunken vessels were not blocking the channel.

Tiger Pass was shoaled to less than 6'. This channel, authorized to 14' provides a shorter route for vessels traveling to the west from the Mississippi River near the mouth. Primarily used by fishing and supply vessels. Dredging was planned.

The Army Corps of Engineers conducted preliminary surveys for Atchafalaya, Houma, and other channels. NOAA continued its surveys of the Mississippi River to verify the Corps centerline survey results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11753">'''{{Katrina}}
This article covers the details of the '''Preparations for [[Hurricane Katrina]],''' a major [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 5]]&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE CATEGORY OF STORM AGAIN--&gt; hurricane that devastated parts of [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Alabama]].

==Preparations by location==
&lt;!-- please put current developments after landfall in &quot;Impact&quot; section, this section is only for predictions/preparations *before* landfall 
--&gt;

===South Florida===
Many living in the area were caught off guard when Katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane in one day and struck southern [[Florida]] on August 25, 2005. [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) forecasts had correctly predicted the strengthening, however, and hurricane watches and warnings were properly issued nearly 36 and 24 hours, respectively, before hurricane conditions were felt in the area.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/pub/al122005.public.004.shtml Tropical Storm Katrina Advisory Number 4].&quot; ''[[National Hurricane Center]].'' August 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al122005.discus.006.shtml Tropical Storm Katrina Discussion Number 6].&quot; ''[[National Hurricane Center]].'' August 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many people living in the South Florida area were unaware when Katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane in one day and struck southern Florida near the Miami-Dade – Broward county line. The hurricane struck between the cities of Aventura, in Miami-Dade County, and Hallandale, in Broward County, on Thursday, August 25, 2005. However, National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts had correctly predicted that Katrina would intensify to hurricane strength before landfall, and hurricane watches and warnings were issued 31.5 hours and 19.5 hours before landfall, respectively — only slightly less than the target thresholds of 36 and 24 hours.

Florida Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on August 24 in advance of Hurricane Katrina's landfall in Florida. Shelters were opened and schools closed in several counties in the southern part of the state. A number of evacuation orders were also issued, mostly voluntary, although a mandatory evacuation was ordered for vulnerable housing in Martin County.

===Gulf Coast===
On August 27, after Katrina crossed southern Florida and strengthened to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] storm, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] declared a state of emergency in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi two days before the hurricane made landfall.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W. &quot;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050827-1.html Statement on Federal Emergency Assistance for Louisiana].&quot; ''[[White House]].'' August 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, the [[National Weather Service]] in [[Slidell, Louisiana]] [[National Weather Service bulletin for New Orleans region|issued a bulletin predicting &quot;devastating&quot; damage]] rivaling the intensity of [[Hurricane Camille]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/warn_archive/LIX/NPW/0828_155101.txt Urgent Weather Message].&quot; ''[[National Weather Service]]/[[New Orleans, Louisiana]].'' August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast [[Louisiana]] as well as coastal [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/stormcenter/2005-08-28-katrina-gulf_x.htm New Orleans flees as Katrina approaches Gulf Coast].&quot; ''[[USA Today]].'' August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, August 28, [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) suspended all [[rail transport|rail]] traffic on its lines south of [[McComb, Mississippi]] (lines owned by its subsidiary [[Illinois Central Railroad]] that extend into New Orleans), in anticipation of damage from the hurricane. To help ease the resumption of services after the storm passes, CN also issued an [[embargo]] with the [[Association of American Railroads]] against all deliveries to points south of [[Osyka, Mississippi]]. [[CSX Transportation]] also suspended service south of Montgomery, Alabama until further notice.

[[Amtrak]], America's rail passenger carrier, announced that the southbound ''[[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]]'' [[passenger train]]s from [[Chicago, Illinois]], from August 29 through September 3, would terminate in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], rather than their usual destination of New Orleans. The corresponding northbound trains would also originate in Memphis. The southbound ''[[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent]]'' from [[New York City]], for the same period, terminated in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], with the corresponding northbound trains originating in Atlanta as well. Amtrak's westbound ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' originated in [[San Antonio, Texas]], rather than its normal origin point of [[Orlando, Florida]]. Amtrak announced that no alternate transportation options would be made available into or out of the affected area.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Simple_Copy_Popup&amp;c=am2Copy&amp;cid=1093554014709 Service Alert: Hurricane Katrina Update - City of New Orleans, Crescent, Sunset Limited - Revised Service Information].&quot; ''[[Amtrak]].'' September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Waterford Nuclear Generating Station|Waterford nuclear power plant]] was also shut down on Sunday, August 28, before Katrina's arrival.

===New Orleans===
{{see also|Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans}}
By August 26, the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered. Some computer models were putting the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] right in the center of their track probabilities, and the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17% (with strike probability rising to 29% by August 28).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/prb/al122005.prblty.015.shtml Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 15],&quot; &amp; &quot;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/prb/al122005.prblty.021.shtml? Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 21].&quot; ''[[National Hurricane Center]].'' August 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario was considered a potential catastrophe because 80% of the New Orleans metropolitan area is below sea level along [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. Since the storm surge produced by the hurricane's right-front quadrant (containing the strongest winds) was more than 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6 m) near [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], emergency management officials in New Orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city, causing major flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Drye, Willie. &quot;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0829_050829_hurricane.html Hurricane Katrina Pulls Its Punches in New Orleans].&quot; ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]].'' August 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This risk of devastation had been known for some time; previous studies by [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|FEMA]] and the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] had warned that a direct hurricane strike on New Orleans could lead to massive flooding, which would lead to thousands of drowning deaths, as well as many more suffering from disease and dehydration, as the flood waters slowly receded from the city.&lt;ref name=Fischetti&gt;{{Citation |last= Fischetti |first=Mark|title=Drowning New Orleans |journal=[[Scientific American]]| volume=285 |issue=4|pages=68–77|date=October 2001|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=00060286-CB58-1315-8B5883414B7F0000|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, Joel K. &quot;[http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0410/feature5/ Gone with the Water].&quot; ''[[National Geographic Magazine]].'' October 2004.'''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(Dead link)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nola.com/hurricane/?/washingaway/ Washing Away: Special Report from The Times-Picayune].&quot; ''[[Times-Picayune]].''

At a news conference 10:00 AM on August 28, shortly after Katrina was upgraded to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] storm, New Orleans mayor [[Ray Nagin]] ordered the first ever [[emergency evacuation|mandatory evacuation]] of the city, calling Katrina, &quot;a storm that most of us have long feared&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,167270,00.html Katrina Heads for New Orleans].&quot; ''[[Fox News]]/[[Associated Press]].'' August 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; To speed up the evacuations, authorities used [[contraflow lane reversal]] on [[Interstate 10]] leading [[west]] of New Orleans, as well as on [[Interstate 55]] and [[Interstate 59|59]] leading north from the city. The city government also established a &quot;refuge of last resort&quot; for citizens who could not leave the city, at the massive [[Louisiana Superdome]], which housed approximately 26,000&amp;nbsp;people with food and water for two days as the storm came ashore.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.nola.com/newslogs/breakingtp/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_Times-Picayune/archives/2005_08_28.html#074657 26,000 shelter at Superdome].&quot; ''[[Times-Picayune]].'' August 28, 2005.'''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(Dead link)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2009}} The Louisiana [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] delivered three truckloads of water and seven truckloads of MRE's to the Superdome, enough to supply 15,000&amp;nbsp;people for three days.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.nola.com/newslogs/breakingtp/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_Times-Picayune/archives/2005_08_28.html#074657].&quot; ''[[Times-Picayune]].'' August 28, 2005.'''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(Dead link)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2009}} 

Louisiana's hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to call for evacuations in three phases, starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds. Persons in areas designated Phase II begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in Phase III areas (including New Orleans) evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Louisiana Citizen Awareness and Disaster Evacuation Guide&quot; by the Louisiana Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness [http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/evacinfo/stateevacrtes.htm Link]&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, many parishes were not able to provide sufficient transportation for citizens who did not have private means of evacuation, and many private care-taking facilities who relied on the same bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges. Fuel and rental cars were in short supply and many forms of public transportation had been shut down well before the storm arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Rulon, Malia; Scott, Katerine Hutt. &quot;[http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050905/NEWS01/509050309/1009 Evacuation plan failed to consider those without transportation].&quot; ''Burlington Free Press.'' March 11, 2006.'''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(Dead link)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}  The end result was that hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists were unable to evacuate and remained in the city. Nonetheless, some estimates claimed that 90-92% of the 1.3&amp;nbsp;million residents of the New Orleans metropolitan region evacuated including 80% of Orleans parish.

The '''Hurricane Katrina tornado outbreak''' was a [[tornado outbreak]] across the eastern [[United States]] from August 29 to August 31, 2005, spawned mostly by the outer bands of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (or the remnants thereof). One person was killed and numerous communities suffered damage of varying degrees from central [[Mississippi]] to [[Pennsylvania]], with [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] the hardest hit. A number of [[tornado]]es associated with Katrina formed, which caused generally minor damages in several regions. In total, 53&amp;nbsp;tornadoes formed in six&amp;nbsp;states as a result of Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[United States Department of Commerce]] |  title=Hurricane Katrina Service Assessment Report | month=June | year=2006 | accessdate=2009-01-09 | format = PDF | url=http://www.weather.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/Katrina.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane Katrina began on August 23, 2005 when it originated as [[Tropical cyclone#Classifications, terminology, and naming|Tropical Depression]] Twelve near the [[Bahamas]]. The next day, the tropical depression strengthened to a [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm]], and was named ''Katrina''; it proceeded to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the southern tip of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]] as a minimal hurricane. In passing across Florida, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] weakened to a tropical storm; however, the warm waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] allowed it to [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensify]] to the sixth strongest [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone]] in recorded history. Afterward, Katrina made landfall as a Category&amp;nbsp;3 storm near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]], and once more near the [[Mississippi]]–[[Louisiana]] border. Katrina progressed northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the [[Great Lakes]], when it was absorbed by a [[cold front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Knabb, Richard D.; Rhome, Jamie R|title=Hurricane Katrina Tropical Cyclone Report|date=August 10, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">The '''Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina''' was the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]' [[United States Congressional committee|congressional committee]] investigating the [[United States Government]]'s failure to respond appropriately to [[Hurricane Katrina]].

The committee was directed to cease 30&amp;nbsp;days after releasing its final report.  That report was released February 15, 2006.

==Members==
Despite the committee's name, it actually did not operate on a bipartisan basis. The committee was to have 20 members, with 11 members from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican majority]] and 9 members from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic minority]]. However, Democrats did not to appoint any members to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RS21243.pdf|title=Ad Hoc Select Committees: Use in the House of Representatives|last=Schneider|first=Judy|date=February 21, 2006|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=2009-02-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hurricane Katrina''' was the twenty-first [[tropical depression]], eleventh named storm and seventh [[hurricane]] of the [[1981 Atlantic hurricane season]]. During its lifetime, Katrina affected the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Cuba]] and the [[Bahamas]], causing the death of two people in [[Cuba]] as it passed over the island. The storm formed from in the area of Smurfville on November 1 in the western [[Caribbean Sea]]; the cloudiness became Tropical Depression Twenty-one two days later, and Tropical Storm Katrina the following day. After passing over [[Grand Cayman]], Katrina moved to the northeast, grazing Cuba as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]]; it later affected the Bahamas as a [[tropical storm]], where it caused 14&amp;nbsp;in (360&amp;nbsp;[[milimetre|mm]]) of [[rain|rainfall]]. Katrina merged with a frontal trough on November 7.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Katrina 1981 track.png}}
On November 1, an area of disturbed weather developed over the western Caribbean. Subsequently, an area of [[low pressure area|low pressure]] began to form. On November 3, the system was designated a tropical depression while located about {{convert|150|mi|km}} to the south of the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence and Joseph Pelissier|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1981|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2009-04-06|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1981.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression intensified while drifting northward, and it was upgraded to a tropical storm early on November 4. As the eleventh tropical storm of the [[1981 Atlantic hurricane season]], it received the name &quot;Katrina&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence|title=Hurricane Katrina Preliminary Report|date=November 30, 1981|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2009-04-06|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1981-prelim/katrina/prelim01.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within 24 hours the storm passed by [[Grand Cayman Island]]. On nearby [[Cayman Brac]], winds gusted to about {{convert|70|mph|km/h}}. Continually strengthening, Katrina accelerated toward the northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt; At 0600 UTC on November 5, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence|title=Hurricane Katrina Preliminary Report Page 3|date=November 30, 1981|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2009-04-06|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1981-prelim/katrina/prelim03.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same day, a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] flight reported a minimum barometric pressure of 980 [[mbar]], and several hours later the flight recorded winds of about {{convert|85|mph|km/h}} on the [[surface weather analysis|surface]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR&quot;/&gt; However, Katrina weakened as it approached land; at the time of [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on eastern Cuba, the minimum central pressure had risen 15 mbar. The storm proceeded northeast, crossing [[The Bahamas]] on November 6. At the time, the cyclone was moving at {{convert|23|mph|km/h}} while maintaining windspeeds of approximately {{convert|60|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt; Katrina's remnants merged with a [[weather front|frontal system]] over the southwestern [[Atlantic Ocean]], and the storm was deemed dissipated on November 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR&quot;/&gt;

==Preparations and impact==
In advance of Katrina, it is estimated that approximately 73,000 residents were evacuated, along with several thousand head of cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Hurricane Hits Cuba, Threatens Bahamas|date=November 06, 1981|publisher=''Logansport Pharos-Tribune''|accessdate=2009-04-07|url=http://thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=109317356_clean&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=2&amp;currentPage=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings|hurricane watch]] was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEWS1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|title=Hurricane Katrina near Cuban Coast|date= November 6, 1981|publisher=''The Daily Herald (Chicago)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the southeast coast of [[Florida]], small craft were advised to remain close to port. However, the storm was not expected to pose a threat to the United States. Heavy rainfall, potentially exceeding {{convert|10|in|mm}}, was anticipated throughout portions of central and eastern Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Hurricane Hits Cuba, Weakly|date=November 06, 1981|publisher=''Tyrone Daily Herald''|accessdate=2009-04-07|url=http://thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=102968957_clean&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=1&amp;currentPage=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban Civil Defense officers issued a storm alert for five provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Katrina Losing Punch|date=November 06, 1981|publisher=''Indiana Gazette''|accessdate=2009-04-07|url=http://thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=114218666_clean&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=4&amp;currentPage=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Grand Cayman, rough seas ripped out a [[Coccoloba uvifera|grape tree]] and slammed it into the Brac Reef Hotel's Bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt; Cuba encountered some [[flash flood]]ing in mountainous areas as Katrina moved across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEWS2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Katrina losing her punch|publisher=Syracuse Herald-Journal|date=November 6, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban officials also reported that two people were killed. The Bahamas received a total of 14&amp;nbsp;in (360&amp;nbsp;mm) of rain; while no deaths or injuries were reported there, heavy rains in the Central area caused flood damage to [[watermelon]], [[tomato]] and [[maize|corn]] crops on [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]]. Damage was otherwise minimal, as Katrina never regained the strength it lost after making landfall in Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEWS3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Katrina fizzles out after destructive run|publisher=[[Syracuse Herald-Journal]]|date=November 10, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad weather from Hurricane Katrina caused the cancellation of the 15th running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup Race.&lt;ref name=&quot;News4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Why did the promoters wait until Saturday to inform the public?|publisher=The Daily Gleaner|date=November 10, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11342">As a result of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and its [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans|effects on New Orleans]], [[Tulane University]] was closed for the second time in its history—the first being during the [[American Civil War]]. The university closed for four months during Katrina, as compared with four years during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tulane University Medical Center.'' John Duffy. Louisiana State University Press. 1984. pp 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine's distance learning programs and courses stayed active.

Prior to Katrina, Tulane University was the largest private employer in the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]; immediately afterward it became the city's single largest employer of any type - public or private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tulane.edu/president_testimony1_2006.cfm Testimony of Scott S. Cowen - President, Tulane University to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce, April 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evacuation ==
Tulane began to publicly respond to the arrival of [[Hurricane Katrina]] on August 27, 2005, with an initial plan to close the university until September 1. The following day, that date was extended to &quot;no earlier than&quot; September 7. University officials led a rare evacuation of nearly 400 students (one report said that the number was closer to 700) to [[Jackson State University]], all of whom remained safe after the hurricane's passage and returned to their homes if they were from outside the gulf coast region. This was the second time Tulane's evacuation plan had been used, the first being in September 2004 during [[Hurricane Ivan]]. In other recent hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Georges|Georges]] in 1998, Tulane simply used its larger dorms as shelters for students.


During the storm, Tulane University Hospital &amp; Clinic lost power and received patients from neighboring hospitals and from the [[Louisiana Superdome]]. These patients, along with all hospital staff, staff family members present, and patients were evacuated within five days via helicopters from the top floor of a neighboring [[parking garage]]. This rescue effort was organized, directed, and paid for by the hospital's parent company, [[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Damage ==
On August 30, the university reported that &quot;physical damage to the area, including Tulane's campuses, was extensive&quot; and conditions in the city were continuing to deteriorate.  Power was out, water levels were rising, all city roads were blocked, and most of the Tulane workforce had evacuated.  (Ultimately, the damage was less than what was at first suspected. The water levels stopped at sea level, resulting in standing water ranging from several inches to several feet on the half of the campus sitting north of Freret Street, but no flooding on the other half, which contains the historic academic quad and buildings that extend to [[Gibson Hall]] on [[St. Charles Avenue]].)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nola.com/katrina/graphics/depths.swf&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1, only a core group of public safety and facilities personnel remained on campus. Tulane president [[Scott Cowen]] and an &quot;emergency team&quot; relocated to [[Houston, Texas]] to coordinate planning for recovery. Tulane reported that security was being maintained on campus and that students' belongings were safe in the unflooded areas of the dormitories. On September 2, President Cowen announced that the University would cancel classes for the fall semester.

== Diaspora ==
[[File:Quilt, Tulane.jpg|thumb|right|In the faculty dining room at Tulane is this impressive quilt representing all organizations that took in Tulane students in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.]]
The [[American Council on Education]] and the [[Association of American Universities]] urged their member institutions to help displaced students from Tulane and the area's other universities. Hundreds of universities (492 in total) made provisions to allow Tulane students (and students from other affected colleges) to enroll as &quot;provisional students&quot; for the fall semester. When the university reopened in the Spring, Tulane transferred credits earned by students elsewhere. To further help students graduate on schedule, Tulane offered two academic semesters between January and June 2006. A regular spring term began January 17, with a seven-week &quot;[[Lagniappe]] Semester&quot; which ran from May 15 through the end of June.

Tulane School of Medicine relocated its students and essential teaching staff to [[Houston, Texas]], and continued its fall semester at [[Baylor College of Medicine]].  This was aided in part by the support of [[Michael DeBakey]], pioneering heart surgeon, graduate of Tulane School of Medicine and chancellor emeritus at Baylor College of Medicine.  Students taking the basic science medical courses used the facilities at Baylor, while 3rd and 4th year students did clinical rotations in several of the nearby teaching hospitals located in Houston, Galveston, and Temple. Tulane attempted to keep the medical students together, and discouraged transfer, except in the most extenuating of circumstances.  Students were able to request transfers, but many medical schools supported Tulane's attempts to retain their student body and thus their school, although some students were successful in their appeals to transfer. The School of Medicine's stay in Texas ('Tulane West' or 'Tulane at Baylor') ended, with the students and faculty returning to New Orleans in July 2006.

==2005–06 Renewal Plan==
Facing a budget shortfall, the Board of Administrators announced a [http://renewal.tulane.edu/  &quot;Renewal Plan&quot;] on December 8, 2005 to reduce its annual operating budget and create a &quot;student-centric&quot; campus. At the end of January 2006, the administration reported an estimated $90 to $125&amp;nbsp;million shortfall for the 2005–06 year. Tulane laid off about 2,000 part-time employees in September and October 2005, 243 non-teaching personnel in November 2005, 230 faculty members in December 2005, and another 200 employees in January 2006.

Under the ''Renewal Plan'', Tulane eliminated six undergraduate and graduate programs in the Engineering School: mechanical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, computer engineering, environmental engineering, and computer science, and also a bachelor's degree in exercise science. The university cut twenty-seven of its forty-five doctoral programs and suspended eight [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] intercollegiate athletic programs.

As a result of the plan dismissing so many tenured faculty without what the [[American Association of University Professors]] considered &quot;due cause,&quot; Tulane, along with three other New Orleans based universities, was censured &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protectrights/academicfreedom/censuredadmins.htm {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the AAUP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/11/aaup A Flood of Censure :: Inside Higher Ed :: Higher Education's Source for News, and Views and Jobs]&lt;/ref&gt; Tulane’s responses purportedly showed that the AAUP's draft report was flawed significantly and contained numerous errors of fact, omission and interpretation. Tulane's administration responded that the final version of the AAUP report acknowledges (mostly in footnotes) some of the corrections Tulane offered, and continued to assert that errors and meritless conclusions remain in the final version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/aaup/ AAUP Letters] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For spring 2006 the administration reported that &quot;94 percent of all students&quot; returned. By keeping the school smaller, officials said they will not have to lower admission standards.

The university ''Renewal Plan'' created a single undergraduate co-ed college in July 2006, discontinuing Tulane's liberal arts and sciences coordinate college system that comprised Tulane College (for men) and the [[H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College]] (for women). On March 16, 2006, the board announced establishment of the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College Institute, an umbrella organization for extracurricular programs, &quot;to enhance women's education at the university.&quot;

Claiming that dissolution of Newcomb College violates conditions on the gifts and will of its founder Josephine Louise Newcomb, Mrs. Newcomb's heirs sued Tulane to enforce their ancestor's [[donor intent|donor's intent]]. The lower courts found for Tulane and the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to review the lower court decision.

Critics of the ''Renewal Plan'' charge the school administration of using Katrina as the excuse to push an agenda that would otherwise have been difficult to accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/gill/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1136963029109650.xml James Gill &amp;#124; NOLA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to cutting several engineering degree programs, students, faculty, and alumni started the [http://www.SaveTulaneEngineering.org ''Save Tulane Engineering''] campaign to reinstate the five engineering majors and the separate school. The [[American Association of University Professors]] expressed concern at the lack of meaningful faculty involvement in crafting the ''Renewal Plan'', as did many students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.SaveTulaneEngineering.org/files/AAUPLetterCowen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2007, Tulane University announced that the School of Science and Engineering will introduce a new major beginning fall 2007, [[Engineering Physics]].  The major, the first new engineering major added since the School of Engineering closed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, is designed to meet the criteria of the Engineering Accreditation Commission, and is geared towards preparing students in quantum physics and nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tulane.edu/article_news_details.cfm?ArticleID=7265 Tulane University Magazine - News]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2007, Tulane announced that more than 1,375 high school seniors had committed to coming to Tulane University as part of the class of 2011.  This increase in enrollment, surpassing 882 students from the class of 2010, and a planned 1,200 students for the class of 2011, marks a strong return in enrollment that nears the level prior to Hurricane Katrina.  Tulane welcomed 1,500 new students including 128 transfer students in fall 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tulane.edu/article_news_details.cfm?ArticleID=7340 Tulane University Magazine - News]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans}}

[[File:People lining up for shelter in Superdome in New Orleans.jpg|thumb|300px|right|People seeking shelter in the Superdome before the arrival of [[Hurricane Katrina]].]]
The [[Louisiana Superdome]] was used as a &quot;shelter of last resort&quot; for those in New Orleans unable to evacuate from [[Hurricane Katrina]] when it struck in late August 2005.

This was the third time the dome had been used as a shelter; it was previously used in 1998 during [[Hurricane Georges]] and in 2004 during [[Hurricane Ivan]]. During Georges, the Superdome had no problems related to the weather, but the evacuees stole furniture and damaged property that resulted in thousands of dollars in losses, and there were difficulties supplying the more than 14,000&amp;nbsp;people living temporarily in the dome with necessities. About a thousand special-needs patients were housed there when Ivan hit the area.

Despite these previous periods of emergency use, as Katrina approached the city, officials had still not stockpiled enough generator fuel, food, and other supplies to handle the needs of the thousands of people seeking refuge there.  According to an article in ''Time'', &quot;Over the years city officials have stressed that they didn't want to make it too comfortable at the Superdome since it was safer to leave the city altogether. 'It's not a hotel,' the director of emergency preparedness for [[St. Tammany Parish]] told the ''[[Times-Picayune]]'' in 1999.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1103591,00.html 4 Places Where the System Broke Down] Amanda Ripley. ''Time''. September 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 9,000 residents and 550 National Guardsmen rode out the night in the Superdome as Katrina came ashore. Maj. Gen. [[Bennett C. Landreneau]], Adjutant General for the Louisiana National Guard, said that the number of people taking shelter in the Superdome rose to around 15,000 to 20,000 as search and rescue teams brought more people to the Superdome from areas hit hard by the flooding. During Katrina, officials set up security checkpoints, and confiscated [[alcohol]], [[weapons]], and [[illicit drugs]] from those seeking refuge in the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,167653,00.html Governor: Evac Superdome, Rescue Centers] Fox News. August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Superdome was built to withstand most catastrophes; the roof was ostensibly estimated to be able to withstand winds with speeds of up to {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}; flood waters could still possibly reach the second level {{convert|20|ft|m}} from the ground, making the structure an unreliable shelter in severe rain and wind. When looking into the origins of this {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} wind security in the Superdome, [[CNN]] reported that no engineering study had ever been completed on the amount of wind the structure can withstand; the building's engineering study was underway as Hurricane Katrina approached and was put on hold. It was used as an emergency shelter although it was neither designed nor tested for the task.  However, the damage to the roof was not catastrophic, with just two relatively small holes and the ripping off of most of the easily replaceable white rubber membrane on the outer layer.

On August 29, 2005, at about 9:00 AM EDT, reports from inside the Superdome were that part of the roof was &quot;peeling off,&quot; daylight could be seen from inside the dome, and rain was pouring in. The [[Associated Press]] stated there were two holes, &quot;each about 15 to {{convert|20|ft|m}} long and 4 to {{convert|5|ft|m}} wide,&quot; and that water was making its way in at elevator shafts and other small openings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0829_050829_superdome.html Photo in the News: Hurricane Shreds Superdome Roof], ''National Geographic''. August 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same morning of August 29, during an interview on ABC news, Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] called the Superdome shelter strategy an &quot;experiment,&quot; when asked if it could hold the storm or the flood.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Despite the planned use of the Superdome as an evacuation center, government officials at the local, state and federal level came under criticism for poor planning and preparation. On August 28, the Louisiana National Guard delivered three truckloads of water and seven truckloads of [[MRE]]s (meals ready to eat), enough to supply 15,000&amp;nbsp;people for three days. There was no water purification equipment on site, no chemical toilets, no antibiotics and no anti-diarrheals stored for a crisis. There were no designated medical staff at work in the evacuation center, no established sick bay within the Superdome, and very few cots available that hadn't been brought in by evacuees. The mayor of New Orleans had, in fact, stated that as a &quot;refuge of last resort,&quot; only limited food, water, and supplies would be provided. Residents who evacuated to the Superdome were warned to bring their own supplies.

When the flooding began on August 30, the Superdome began to slowly fill with water, though it remained confined to the field level. Later that day, Governor Blanco ordered New Orleans completely evacuated.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;/&gt; On August 31, it was announced that the Superdome evacuees would move to the [[Reliant Astrodome]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. With no power and no water, sanitary conditions within the Superdome had rapidly deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4214746.stm Britons describe hurricane ordeal]. BBC. September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 31, there had been three deaths in the Superdome: two elderly medical patients and a man who is believed to have committed suicide by jumping from the upper level seats. There were also unconfirmed reports of rape, vandalism, violent assaults, crack dealing/drug abuse, and gang activity inside the Superdome. On September 11, New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass reported there were &quot;no confirmed reports of any type of sexual assault.&quot;

While a few medical patients were able to be transported out by helicopter it wasn't until August 31 that the first group of about 100 tourists (mainly international visitors) were &quot;smuggled&quot; out from the Superdome to the Sports Arena next door.  This was done as covertly as possible so as to not cause rioting or charges of favoritism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harris   [[Diary From the Dome, Reflections on Fear and Privilege During Katrina]]  Vantage Press 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

National Guardsmen accompanied by buses (475 total) and supply trucks arrived at the Superdome on September 1. The buses were sent to pick up the evacuees from the Superdome and the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]], where more than 20,000&amp;nbsp;people had been crowded in similarly poor living conditions. 13,000 evacuees were taken to the [[Reliant Astrodome]] in [[Houston]]. By September 4, the last large group from the Superdome had been evacuated.  The 2008 memoir, Diary From the Dome, Reflections describes the personal ordeal of a tourist who was stuck in the Superdome during Katrina and the levee failures.

On September 6, speculation arose that the Louisiana Superdome would have to be demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005638.php Superdome may have to be demolished] Fanblogs College Football blog. September 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the New Orleans Saints chose to repair and renovate the Superdome beginning in early 2006.

== Closed for events ==

===Professional sports===
After the events surrounding Katrina, the Superdome was not used during the 2005 football season. The [[New Orleans Saints]] played four of their scheduled home games at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]]'s [[Tiger Stadium (Baton Rouge)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Baton Rouge]], three at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and one at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], during the [[2005 NFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2159595 Saints' home games: 4 at LSU, 3 in Alamodome]. ESPN. September 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished with a 3-13 record.

On October 21, 2005, Benson issued a statement saying that he had not made any decision about the future of the Saints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nola.com/sports/t-p/index.ssf?/base/sports-20/1129961793235820.xml ''Times-Picayune''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' reported that sources close to the Saints' organization said that Benson planned to void his lease agreement with New Orleans by declaring the Superdome unusable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/stories/MYSA102105.01A.FBN_saints_lead.1d44511b.html Benson to bail on Superdome] ''Express-News''. October 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Saints announced that they would be returning to New Orleans, with the first home game on September 25, 2006 against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. Before that first game, the team announced it had sold out its entire home schedule to season ticket holders — a first in franchise history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/NO/9671853 NFL.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tulane Green Wave'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Tulane University]] postponed its scheduled football game against the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] to November 26. Their first game, against [[Mississippi State University]], was played September 17 at [[Independence Stadium (United States)|Independence Stadium]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. Overall, the team used six different stadiums for their six home games, including [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] in Baton Rouge, [[Cajun Field]] in Lafayette, La., [[Joe Aillet Stadium]] in Ruston, La., [[Malone Stadium]] in Monroe, La., and [[Ladd Peebles Stadium]] in Mobile, Ala. The team finished with a 2-9 record.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11044">{{for|detailed information on the team's 2005 season|2005 New Orleans Saints season}}

[[File:AaronBrooks.jpg|thumb|right|Saints quarterback [[Aaron Brooks (American football)|Aaron Brooks]] prepares to pass the ball during a November 2005 home game played at [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]], the stadium of the [[LSU Tigers football|Louisiana State Tigers college football team]]. Because [[Hurricane Katrina]] damaged the Saints' regular home stadium [[Louisiana Superdome]], the Saints played four home games for 2005 at Tiger Stadium, three at the [[Alamodome]] and one at [[Giants Stadium]].]]

After [[Hurricane Katrina]] devastated the city of [[New Orleans]] on August 29, 2005 and caused extensive [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the Louisiana Superdome|damage to the Louisiana Superdome]], the [[New Orleans Saints]] were not able to play any home games there for the entire [[2005 NFL season]] (the stadium was also used to temporarily house victims of the storm). After practicing for approximately a week in [[San Jose, California]], where they had evacuated in conjunction with a pre-season game against the [[Oakland Raiders]], the team set up temporary headquarters and arranged for practice facilities in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], where owner [[Tom Benson]] started his car dealership empire. The league then announced that although the Saints' first home game on September 18 against the [[New York Giants]] would be played at [[Giants Stadium]] at 7:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] on September 19, other home games would be split between [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] (80&amp;nbsp;miles/130&amp;nbsp;km from New Orleans), and the [[Alamodome]] in San Antonio (540&amp;nbsp;miles/869&amp;nbsp;km from New Orleans); offices and practice would remain in San Antonio throughout the season. Various media reports in the San Antonio Express-News indicated the owner and government officials in San Antonio were working behind the scenes concerning a possible permanent relocation to San Antonio. San Antonio Mayor [[Phil Hardberger]] had pushed a strong verbal campaign to pursue the Saints. Other officials, including Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]], had indicated that they would also support a relocation to San Antonio, including using funding to upgrade the Alamodome, or possibly build a new stadium. [[Dallas Cowboys]] owner [[Jerry Jones]], whose team currently has San Antonio as part of its territorial rights, also supported an NFL team moving to San Antonio. However, the NFL and commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] were both in favor of keeping the franchise in New Orleans or at least delaying a decision on a potential relocation. Other rumors of the period said that the NFL [[History of the National Football League in Los Angeles|preferred to move the team to Los Angeles]], or even to [[National Football League in Toronto|expand to Toronto]] instead, as both cities are over twice the size of San Antonio.

Many fans in Louisiana were angered and felt that Hardberger and Perry were taking advantage of New Orleans' misfortunes to try to steal the Saints. Benson's actions also drew the anger of New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]], who called Benson's actions shameful and disrespectful to New Orleans fans who have supported the team for nearly four decades of mostly losing seasons.  San Antonio officials, on the other hand, countered that Benson may have no choice—at the time, it was thought by some that New Orleans might never fully recover as a viable location for an NFL franchise, and that they were simply giving the franchise an option to relocate and remain economically viable, in this case to a city in which Benson already lives and has business interests. Benson indicated in his open letter to the Gulf Coast that San Antonio officials were only doing what any city seeking a franchise would do—recruit the franchise.

==Prospective relocation controversy==

On October 21, 2005, Benson issued a statement saying that he had not made any decision about the future of the Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/sports/t-p/index.ssf?/base/sports-20/1129961793235820.xml |title=New Orleans &amp; Louisiana Sports &amp;#124; High School, College &amp; Pro Sports News |publisher=Nola.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' reported that sources close to the Saints' organization said that Benson planned to void his lease agreement with New Orleans by declaring the [[Louisiana Superdome]] unusable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/stories/MYSA102105.01A.FBN_saints_lead.1d44511b.html MySA.com: KENS 5: Sports]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] met with Benson and Louisiana governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] at the Saints' first home game in Baton Rouge on October 30 against the [[Miami Dolphins]]. After the meeting, he stopped just short of making a formal commitment to keep the Saints in New Orleans. Said Tagliabue: &quot;The Saints are Louisiana's team and have been since the late '60s when my predecessor [[Pete Rozelle]] welcomed them to the league as New Orleans' team and Louisiana's team. Our focus continues to be on having the Saints in Louisiana.&quot; He dispelled rumors that had the Saints relocating to [[Los Angeles]]. Tagliabue appointed an eight-owner advisory committee to help decide the team's future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2208747 |title=ESPN - Tagliabue, state working to keep Saints in Louisiana - NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson left the game with five minutes left in the fourth quarter. A [[WWL-TV]] camera crew recorded him leaving the stadium. Benson angrily pushed the camera away and then got into an argument with a fan. Video of the altercation was obtained by WWL-TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwltv.com/perl/common/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.wwltv.com/1031benson.wmv Video Player]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Benson issued a statement that he would no longer go to Baton Rouge for Saints home games because he felt he and his family were in danger from abuse at the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-benson-saintsgames&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns Yahoo! Sports - Sports News, Scores, Rumors, Fantasy Games, and more]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, Benson agreed with Louisiana state officials to extend his opt out clause with the Superdome and Louisiana because of the disaster until January 2007. 

In the midst of the Katrina relocation controversy, several groups of investors approached Benson with offers to buy the team and keep them in Louisiana, the most notable group being one led by [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] analyst and former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]], who is a Louisiana native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-4/113169397889570.xml |title=The Times-Picayune on |publisher=Nola.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benson expressed that he had no intention of selling the team and planned to eventually hand down ownership to his granddaughter, Saints owner/executive [[Rita Benson LeBlanc]]. Benson spoke to press following an NFL owners' meeting on November 15, during which he reiterated that the team is not for sale, but also stated that other NFL owners, along with Tagliabue, were working with him to keep the team in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/sports/ci_3220782 |title=LA Daily News - Benson gets support from NFL brothers |publisher=Dailynews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, Tagliabue met with Benson and New Orleans officials to tour the city and assess the viability of playing in New Orleans in 2006. On January 11, 2006, at a press conference in New Orleans, Tagliabue announced that the Saints would likely play all eight home games at the Superdome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwltv.com/sports/saints/stories/WWL011106tpsaints.6963c34e.html News for New Orleans, Louisiana | Saints | News for New Orleans, Louisiana | wwltv.com]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superdome officials said January 12 that the Dome would be ready by September 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwltv.com/local/stories/WWL011206tpdome.6f695475.html News for New Orleans, Louisiana | Local News | News for New Orleans, Louisiana | wwltv.com]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL announced on February 5, 2006, that the Superdome would reopen on September 24 when the Saints were to host the [[Atlanta Falcons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neworleanssaints.com/newsroomarticle.cfm?articleid=2292 New Orleans Saints - 404]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tagliabue said the team's preseason games would likely be played elsewhere in the region. He also stated that the Saints and the NFL were committed to New Orleans for the long haul.

Starting in the fall of 2006, the Saints returned to playing all of their regular home games of the [[2006 New Orleans Saints season|2006 season]] in New Orleans at the Superdome. Their first game back in New Orleans, on September 25, 2006, was marked by a dramatic blocked [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] early in the first quarter, with [[Steve Gleason]] blocking the punt and [[Curtis Deloatch]] recovering the ball in the Falcons' [[end zone]] for a touchdown. It was the first score in the Saints' first game in New Orleans in nearly 21 months.  The Saints won the game and, unexpectedly, went on to have [[2006 New Orleans Saints season|the most successful season]] in their history up to that time, reaching the NFC Championship Game for the first time in franchise history.  

In April 2009, the franchise reached a deal that would keep the Saints in New Orleans until at least 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/saints/2009-04-29-jindal-saints-deal_N.htm |title=AP: Saints, lawmakers agree to new Superdome lease |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 season]], the Saints finished 13-3 and won [[Super Bowl XLIV]] over the [[Indianapolis Colts]].  In July 2012, &quot;Rebirth&quot;, a statue depicting Gleason blocking the punt, was erected outside the Superdome; a news report commented that the blocked punt &quot;etched Steve Gleason into Saints lore and became symbolic of New Orleans' resilience in the face of disaster&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8207214/new-orleans-saints-unveil-statue-steve-gleason-blocked-punt &quot;Steve Gleason statue unveiled&quot;], [[Associated Press]] at [[ESPN.com]], July 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 2005 [[Time in New Zealand|NZST]] (29 August [[Central Time Zone (North America)|UTC-6/-5]]) [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] sent condolences by phone and in a letter with an offer of help to United States President [[George W. Bush]] and Foreign Affairs Minister [[Phil Goff]] also sent a message of sympathy to Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]]. This offer included an official pledge by the [[New Zealand Government]] to the [[Red Cross]] of $2&amp;nbsp;million for aid and disaster relief. 

After the [[New Zealand]] government's initial pledge of money, they offered further contributions to the recovery effort including Urban Search and Rescue Teams, a Disaster Victim Identification team and post disaster recovery personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0509/S00159.htm Scoop: Further NZ assistance in wake of Hurricane Katrina&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Those offers were gratefully received by the United States. A senior member of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, John Titmus went to [[Denton, Texas]] to lead an official UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team to assess the damage from [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The US Embassy in [[Wellington]] said it deeply appreciated the $2&amp;nbsp;million donation and gratefully acknowledged the offer of disaster management personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/24102 Beehive – New Zealand sends condolences to United States&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand victims of Katrina==
After Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, four New Zealanders who were in New Orleans at the time were reported missing nine days after the event. The [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] (MFAT) sent details of the missing persons to authorities in the United States with some reportedly being sent to the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_10344400&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/floods/news/article.cfm?c_id=205&amp;objectid=10344400 |title=Four Kiwis missing in Katrina's wake |author=Juliet Rowan and Jarrod Booker |date=7 September 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in Florida''' were in both in the [[South Florida|southern portion]] of the state and in the [[Florida Panhandle|panhandle]]. After developing on August&amp;nbsp;23, Katrina made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near the border of [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] and [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] counties with {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} winds on August 25. While it was crossing the state, the hurricane's convection was asymmetrical, primarily located to the south and east of the center. As a result, high rainfall totals occurred in the [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] area, peaking at {{convert|16.43|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Perrine, Florida|Perrine]]. The rains caused flooding, and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 1.4&amp;nbsp;million people without power. Damage in South Florida was estimated at $523&amp;nbsp;million (2005&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]), mostly as a result of crop damage. Further south, the hurricane spawned a tornado in the [[Florida Keys]]. In the island chain, Katrina dropped heavy rainfall and gusty winds.

After emerging from the state, Katrina intensified into one of the [[List of most intense tropical cyclones|strongest Atlantic hurricanes]], becoming a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. It moved ashore in [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]], although the hurricane's outer periphery produced a {{convert|5.37|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm surge]] in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] along the panhandle. High waves caused beach erosion and closed nearby roadways. There were five tornadoes in northwestern Florida. Damage was estimated along the panhandle at $100&amp;nbsp;million. Throughout the state, the hurricane killed 14&amp;nbsp;people, of which 6 were directly related to the storm's effects. Due to damage from Katrina, 11&amp;nbsp;[[List of counties in Florida|Florida counties]] were declared federal disaster areas.

==Background==
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 25 2005.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite image of Hurricane Katrina approaching Florida]]
Hurricane Katrina developed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the [[Bahamas]] on August&amp;nbsp;23, partially from the remains of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]]. As it moved slowly northwestward, it developed organized [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, and it intensified into a tropical storm on August&amp;nbsp;24. A building [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] turned Katrina to the west,&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;&gt;{{cite report|author=Richard Knabb, Jamie Rhome, and Daniel Brown|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|date=2005-12-20|title=Hurricane Katrina Tropical Cyclone Report|accessdate=2012-04-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing it over the [[Gulf Stream]]. With warm waters and favorable [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]], the storm continued strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Stacy Stewart|date=2005-08-25|title=Tropical Storm Katrina Discussion Eight|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2012-04-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al122005.discus.008.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 2100&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on August&amp;nbsp;25, Katrina attained hurricane status, based on observations from the [[Hurricane Hunters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Stacy Stewart|date=2005-08-25|title=Hurricane Katrina Discussion Nine|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2012-04-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al122005.discus.009.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensification of the ridge to its north caused the hurricane to turn to the west-southwest, and as it approached the Florida coastline Katrina developed a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. At 2230&amp;nbsp;UTC on August&amp;nbsp;25, Katrina made landfall near the border of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] counties with winds of around {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The hurricane moved southwestward and crossed Florida in about six hours, during which its eye became better defined. During its passage, northerly [[wind shear]] shifted the deepest convection to the south and east of the center, and Katrina briefly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] early on August&amp;nbsp;26. After emerging from the state, Katrina intensified into one of the [[List of most intense tropical cyclones|strongest Atlantic hurricanes]], becoming a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Katrina ultimately moved ashore in southeastern Louisiana on August&amp;nbsp;29, where it caused severe storm surge flooding and catastrophic damage; it dissipated the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; 

In the preceding 2004 season, Florida was affected by four hurricanes, including hurricanes [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]] and [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]] which hit [[Martin County, Florida|Martin County]] and caused billions in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Lixion Avila, et al.|date=2004-12-01|title=Monthly Tropical Weather Summary... Corrected|accessdate=2012-04-07|publisher=National Hurricane Center|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/tws/MIATWSAT_nov.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==
[[File:Katrina 2005 rainfall.gif|thumb|right|Total rainfall from Katrina in the United States. Data for the [[New Orleans]] area are not available]]
About nine hours after the system developed on August&amp;nbsp;24, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] from the [[Seven Mile Bridge]] to [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]]. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]] to Vero Beach after the storm's intensification became apparent. About 25&amp;nbsp;hours before Katrina made landfall, the tropical storm watch was extended northward to [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]], and a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued for [[Lake Okeechobee]]. Early on August&amp;nbsp;25, a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee. In southeastern Florida, the lead time for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31.5 and 19.5&amp;nbsp;hours before landfall, respectively; both were 4.5&amp;nbsp;hours less than the desired lead time. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key, southward through the [[Florida Keys]] to the [[Dry Tortugas]], and northward along the western coast to [[Longboat Key, Florida|Longboat Key]]. The warning in the Florida Keys occurred only nine hours before the onset of tropical storm force winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; 

On August&amp;nbsp;25, Florida's Emergency Operations Center was activated in Tallahassee to monitor the progress of the hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]|date=2005-08-25|title=Officials Urge Preparedness As Katrina Intensifies|accessdate=2012-04-11|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Katrina moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area. Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|title=Hurricane Katrina drenches Florida|date=2005-08-26|publisher=Television New Zealand|accessdate=2012-04-10|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/606925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in Miami-Dade County advised residents in mobile homes or with special needs to evacuate.

While Katrina was intensifying as a major hurricane on August&amp;nbsp;28, the NHC issued a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from the Alabama border to [[Destin, Florida|Destin]] along the [[Florida panhandle|panhandle]]. The warning was later extended to [[Indian Pass, Florida|Indian Pass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; Officials issued a mandatory evacuation for portions of [[Walton County, Florida|Walton]], [[Gulf County, Florida|Gulf]], [[Franklin County, Florida|Franklin]], and [[Wakulla County, Florida|Wakulla]] counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt;

==Impact==
Overall, Hurricane Katrina killed 14&amp;nbsp;people in the state, of which 6 were directly related to the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; Six of the indirect deaths were in South Florida, of which three were from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity. At least five people were injured due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Overall damage totaled $623&amp;nbsp;million (2005&amp;nbsp;USD).&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt;

===Miami area===

While moving across Florida, Katrina had an asymmetric area of thunderstorms, which placed the strongest winds and rainfall over Miami-Dade County.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; The highest precipitation total related to hurricane in the United States was {{convert|16.43|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Perrine, Florida|Perrine]], or about halfway between Miami and [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rain&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=David M.

The heavy rainfall flooded neighborhoods in the area,&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; damaging over 100&amp;nbsp;houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt; The storm left about 1.4&amp;nbsp;million people without power in Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt826&quot;/&gt; In [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] north of Katrina's first landfall, the hurricane dropped light rainfall, ranging from {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; Downed trees killed three people in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; Train and bus service was disrupted in the Miami area.&lt;ref name=&quot;afp827&quot;&gt;{{cite news|agency=Agence France-Presse|newspaper=New York Times|date=2005-08-27|title=Reeling from hurricane, Florida braces for 2nd hit|accessdate=2012-04-10|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/26/travel/26iht-travel27.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property damage was estimated at $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt; Widespread flooding affected crop nurseries and greenhouses,&lt;ref name=&quot;crop&quot;&gt;{{cite report|page=17|title= Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|volume=92|number=35|date=2005-08-30|accessdate=2012-04-11|url=http://usda01.library.cornell.edu/usda/waob/weather_weekly//2000s/2005/weather_weekly-08-30-2005.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crop damage totaled $423&amp;nbsp;million. Three people drowned in Miami-Dade County, two of whom on boats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt;

===Florida Keys and Monroe County===
Katrina weakened into a tropical storm while moving across [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; Tides reached {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} in mainland Monroe County, which flooded several houses and vehicles in [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]] in [[Everglades National Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt; Most of the [[Florida Keys]] reported tropical storm-force winds. A station on Key West reported sustained winds of {{convert|61|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with gusts to {{convert|74|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. While the storm passed to its north, the city reported a storm surge of about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; The storm's outer rainbands spawned an [[Fujita scale|F2]] tornado in [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]] on August&amp;nbsp;26, which damaged an airport hangar and several homes.

===Florida panhandle===
[[File:Katrina-14673.jpg|right|thumb|Roads covered by sand along the Florida panhandle]]
After striking southeastern Louisiana, Hurricane Katrina made its final landfall in Mississippi, during which it produced a storm surge of about {{convert|5.37|ft|m|abbr=on}} in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; The hurricane struck months after [[Hurricane Dennis]] affected the same area.

The storm caused moderate to severe beach erosion along the gulf coast,&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt; and washed sand onto many coastal roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|title=Photograph by Marvin Nauman taken on 08/31/2005 in Florida|accessdate=2012-04-11|url=http://www.fema.gov/photolibrary/photo_details.do?id=14673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winds along the Florida panhandle peaked at {{convert|56|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in Pensacola, with gusts to {{convert|71|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; High winds briefly closed the [[Interstate 10 in Florida|Interstate 10 bridge]] over [[Escambia Bay]] in Pensacola. The outer rainbands of the hurricane spawned five tornadoes, all of them weak and not very damaging. Rainfall along the panhandle reached {{convert|7.80|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Philpot, Florida|Philpot]], which caused flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;/&gt;

The winds caused damage to some trees and structures and there was some minor flooding in the panhandle. There were two indirect fatalities from Katrina in [[Walton County, Florida|Walton County]] as a result of a traffic accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr&quot;/&gt; Along the Florida panhandle, 77,000 customers lost power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Katrina at a Glance|date=2005-08-31|page=4A|newspaper=Mobile Register|url=http://www.al.com/mobileregister/pdf/register083105a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage along the panhandle was estimated at $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdc&quot;&gt;{{cite report|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|volume=47|number=08|date=August 2005|title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena with Late Reports and Corrections|accessdate=2012-04-10|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS-9A9F03FE-85FE-4329-8843-6D145043E2C8.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On August&amp;nbsp;28, or about three days after Katrina struck the state, President [[George W.

The declaration was determined after the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) sent 20&amp;nbsp;State Emergency Response Teams to determine the extent of damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|date=2005-08-31|title=FEMA Expands Public Assistance For South Florida Counties Affected By Katrina|accessdate=2012-04-11|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18500}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, President Bush declared a disaster area for seven counties along the Florida panhandle on September&amp;nbsp;6; the counties were [[Bay County, Florida|Bay]], [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]], Franklin, Gulf, [[Okaloosa County, Florida|Okaloosa]], [[Santa Rosa County, Florida|Santa Rosa]], and Walton.

[[Image:NO Arena CIMG6266.jpg|thumb|right|The New Orleans Arena in May 2006]]
After [[Hurricane Katrina]] devastated the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] on August 29, 2005, and caused extensive damage to the [[New Orleans Arena]], the [[New Orleans Hornets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] were unable to play any home games there for the entire [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]]. They temporarily relocated to [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], becoming the '''New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets'''. After playing the majority of home games for both the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06]] and [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07]] seasons at the [[Chesapeake Energy Arena|Ford Center]] in Oklahoma City, the Hornets returned to New Orleans for the [[2007–08 NBA season|2007–08 season]].

Following the success of the Hornets' tenure in the city, the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|relocated to Oklahoma City]] for the [[2008–09 NBA season|2008–09 season]], and now compete as the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2219124 | title=Stern: Oklahoma City top candidate if team moves | publisher=[[ESPN]] | date=2005-11-09| accessdate=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SuperdomeAfter.png|thumb|left|The New Orleans Arena at right following the storm]]
Because of the extensive damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area made it impossible to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-09/02/content_474577.htm|title=NBA seeks relocation for New Orleans Hornets|date=September 2, 2005|work=China Daily|accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[training camp]] scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], instead of their usual location, [[Alario Center]] in [[Westwego, Louisiana|Westwego]].&lt;ref name=&quot;September 2, 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news

By September 10, the prospect of securing a Baton Rouge location to host the Hornets was fading as a result of the facilities being utilized for hurricane related relief operations. Numerous cities inquired about hosting the franchise for the season, including [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Oklahoma City and [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name=&quot;September 10, 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7725">In the aftermath of the devastation caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], the issue of human rights was studied closely.  The [[UN Human Rights Committee]] issued a 2006 report recommending that the [[United States]] endeavor to make certain the rights of poor and [[black Americans]] &quot;are fully taken into consideration in the reconstruction plans with regard to access to housing, education and health care&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;26. The Committee, while taking note of the various rules and regulations prohibiting discrimination in the provision of disaster relief and emergency assistance, remains concerned about information that poor people and in particular African-Americans, were disadvantaged by the rescue and evacuation plans implemented when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States of America, and continue to be disadvantaged under the reconstruction plans. (articles 6 and 26) The State party should review its practices and policies to ensure the full implementation of its obligation to protect life and of the prohibition of discrimination, whether direct or indirect, as well as of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, in the areas of disaster prevention and preparedness, emergency assistance and relief measures. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it should increase its efforts to ensure that the rights of poor people and in particular African-Americans, are fully taken into consideration in the reconstruction plans with regard to access to housing, education and healthcare. The Committee wishes to be informed about the results of the inquiries into the alleged failure to evacuate prisoners at the Parish prison, as well as the allegations that New Orleans residents were not permitted by law enforcement officials to cross the Greater New Orleans Bridge to Gretna, Louisiana.
