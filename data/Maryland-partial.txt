Maryland    Maryland ( )  is a U.S. state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. Maryland was the seventh state to ratify the United States Constitution, and has three occasionally used nicknames: the Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State.Maryland is one of the smallest states in terms of area, but it remains one of the most populous and the most densely populated states of the United States.  The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis.  The state is named after Queen Henrietta Maria.   Of the 50 U.S. states, Maryland has the highest median household income, making it the wealthiest state in the nation. Ethnically, the majority of Marylanders are of German and Irish descent, though the state has a large group of African Americans.GeographyPhysical geography Maryland has an area of   and is comparable in overall area with the European country of Belgium ( ).  It is the 42nd largest/9th smallest state, and is closest in size to Hawaii ( ), the next smallest state. The next largest state, Maryland's neighbor West Virginia, is almost twice the size of Maryland ( ).Maryland possesses a variety of topography, contributing to its nickname, "America in Miniature."  It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forest in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the mountains to the west.Maryland is bounded on its north by Pennsylvania, on its west by West Virginia, on its east by Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean, and on its south, across the Potomac River, by West Virginia and Virginia. The mid-portion of this border is interrupted on the Maryland side by Washington, D.C., which sits on land that was originally part of Maryland and Montgomery and Prince George's Counties north of the Potomac River, and including the town of Georgetown, Maryland and was ceded to the Federal Government in 1790 to form the District of Columbia along with a part from Virginia south of the Potomac, including the town of Alexandria, Virginia (Virginia retro-ceded its portion which was returned in the 1840s).  The Chesapeake Bay nearly bisects the state, and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the Eastern Shore.Most of the state's waterways are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western Garrett County (drained by the Youghiogheny River as part of the watershed of the Mississippi River), the eastern half of Worcester County (which drains into Maryland's Atlantic coastal bays), and a small portion of the state's northeast corner (which drains into the Delaware River watershed). So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the Bay State, a nickname that has actually been used by Massachusetts for a long time.The highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of  , is Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain, in the southwest corner of Garrett County, near the border with West Virginia and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River.  Close to the small town of Hancock, in western Maryland, about two-thirds of the way across the state, there is   between its borders. This geographical curiosity makes Maryland the narrowest state,  bordered by the Mason-Dixon Line to the north, and the northwards-arching Potomac River to the south.Portions of Maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions. For example, the Delmarva Peninsula is composed of the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland, the entire state of Delaware, and the two counties that make up the Eastern Shore of Virginia, whereas the westernmost counties of Maryland are considered part of Appalachia. Much of the Baltimore–Washington corridor lies just south of the Piedmont in the Coastal Plain,  though it straddles the border between the two regions.A quirk of the geography of Maryland is the absence of any natural lakes,  though there are numerous ponds. During the latter Ice Ages, the glaciers did not reach as far south as Maryland, and therefore they did not carve out the deep natural lakes that exist in states farther north. There are numerous man-made lakes, the largest of these being the Deep Creek Lake, a reservoir in Garrett County in westernmost Maryland. The lack of a glacial history also accounts for Maryland's soil, which is sandier and muddier than the rocky soils farther to the north and northeast.Human geography The majority of Maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding Washington, D.C., and also in and around Maryland's most populous city, Baltimore. Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the Fall Line, the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and/or waterfalls. Maryland's capital city, Annapolis, is one exception to this pattern, since it lies along the banks of the Severn River, close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay.The other population centers of Maryland include suburban areas of Columbia and Ellicott City in Howard County; Silver Spring, Rockville, and Gaithersburg in Montgomery County; Laurel, College Park, Greenbelt, Hyattsville, Landover, Clinton, Bowie, and Upper Marlboro in Prince George's County; Frederick in Frederick County; Hagerstown in Washington County; Waldorf in Charles County; Pikesville, Essex, and Towson in Baltimore County; and Glen Burnie and Hanover in Anne Arundel.The eastern, southern, and western portions of the state tend to be more rural, although they are dotted with cities of regional importance such as Salisbury and Ocean City on the Eastern Shore, Lexington Park and Waldorf in Southern Maryland, and Cumberland in Western Maryland.Maryland's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and Southern regions of the United States. Generally, rural Western Maryland between the West Virginian Panhandle and Pennsylvania has an Appalachian culture; the Southern and Eastern Shore regions of Maryland embody a Southern culture,  while densely populated Central Maryland—radiating outward from Baltimore and Washington, D.C.—has more in common with that of the Northeast.  The U.S. Census Bureau designates Maryland as one of the South Atlantic States, but it is commonly associated with the Mid-Atlantic States and/or Northeastern United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents.               ClimateMaryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to downslope winds.The eastern half of Maryland lies on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, with very flat topography and very sandy or muddy soil. This region has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with hot, humid summers and a short, mild to cool winter; it falls under USDA Hardiness zone 8a.    This region includes the cities of Salisbury, Annapolis, Ocean City, the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.Beyond this region lies the Piedmont, with average seasonal snowfall totals generally exceeding   and, as part of USDA Hardiness zones 7b and 7a,  temperatures below   are more common. From the Cumberland Valley on westward, the climate begins to transition to a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa). This region includes northern and western greater Baltimore, Westminster, Gaithersburg, Frederick, and Hagerstown.Farther into western Maryland, the higher elevations of Allegany County and Garrett County display more characteristics of the humid continental zone, due in part to elevation, and are more similar to that of south-central Pennsylvania, with Cumberland listed as one of the regional cities by Altoona's WTAJ weather center.  They fall under USDA Hardiness zones 6b and below. Precipitation in the state is characteristic of the East Coast. Annual rainfall ranges from   with more in higher elevations. Nearly every part of Maryland receives   per month of rain. Average annual snowfall varies from   in the coastal areas to over   in the western mountains of the state. Because of its location near the Atlantic Coast, Maryland is somewhat vulnerable to tropical cyclones, although the Delmarva Peninsula, and the outer banks of North Carolina to the south provide a large buffer, such that a strike from a major hurricane (category 3 or above) is not very likely but is not impossible. More often, Maryland might get the remnants of a tropical system which has already come ashore and released most of its wind energy. Maryland averages around 30–40 days of thunderstorms a year, and averages around six tornado strikes annually.   NOAA National Climatic Data Center. Retrieved on October 24, 2006.

A good dose of annual precipitation helps to support many types of plants, including seagrass and various reeds at the smaller end of the spectrum to the gigantic Wye Oak, a huge example of White oak, the state tree, which can grow in excess of   tall.Middle Atlantic coastal forests, typical of the southeastern Atlantic coastal plain, grow around Chesapeake Bay and on the Delmarva Peninsula. Moving west, a mixture of Northeastern coastal forests and Southeastern mixed forests cover the central part of the state. The Appalachian Mountains of western Maryland are home to Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. These give way to Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests near the West Virginia border.   Many foreign species are cultivated in the state, some as ornamentals, others as novelty species. Included among these are the Crape Myrtle, Italian Cypress, live oak in the warmer parts of the state,  and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state.  USDA plant hardiness zones in the state range from Zone 5 in the extreme western part of the state to 6 and 7 in the central part, and Zone 8 around the southern part of the coast, the bay area, and parts of metropolitan Baltimore. Invasive plant species, such as kudzu, tree of heaven, multiflora rose, and Japanese stiltgrass, stifle growth of endemic plant life.  Maryland's state  flower, the Black-eyed Susan, grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state.  The state insect, the Baltimore Checkerspot Butterfly, is not common as it is near the southern edge of its range.  435 species of birds have been reported from Maryland.   FaunaThe state harbors a great number of deer, especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state, and overpopulation can become a problem from year-to-year.  Mammals can be found ranging from the mountains in the west to the central areas and include bears,   Maryland's Public Information Network Retrieved on 4-9-2008.  bobcats,    foxes, coyote,    raccoons, and otters. There is a population of rare   wild horses found on Assateague Island. Every year during the last week of July, wild horses are captured and waded across a shallow bay for sale at Chincoteague, Virginia. This conservation technique ensures the tiny island is not overrun by the horses.  The ponies and their sale were popularized by the children's book, Misty of Chincoteague. They are believed to be descended from horses who escaped from shipwrecks.The purebred Chesapeake Bay Retriever dog was bred specifically for water sports, hunting and search and rescue in the Chesapeake area.    In 1878 the Chesapeake Bay Retriever was the first individual retriever breed recognized by the American Kennel Club. Maryland's reptile and amphibian population is led by the Diamondback Terrapin turtle, which was adopted as the mascot of University of Maryland, College Park. The state is the territory of the Baltimore Oriole, which is the official state bird and mascot of the MLB team the Baltimore Orioles. Environmental awarenessIn 2007, Forbes.com rated Maryland as the fifth "Greenest" state in the country behind three of the Pacific States and Vermont. Maryland ranks 40th in total energy consumption nationwide, and it managed less toxic waste per capita than all but six states in 2005.  In April 2007 Maryland joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—a regional initiative formed by all of the Northeastern states, Washington D.C., and three Canadian provinces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.EarthquakesEarthquakes in Maryland are infrequent due to its distance  from tectonic plates and seismic/earthquake zones. The earthquakes that do occur are small, but may be felt over wide areas.   The M5.8 Virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout Maryland. Buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage easily. History 17th centuryIn 1629, George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore in the Irish House of Lords, fresh from his failure further north with Newfoundland's Avalon colony, applied to Charles I for a royal charter for what was to become the Province of Maryland. Calvert's interest in creating a colony derived from his Catholicism and his desire for the creation of a haven in the New World for Catholics. He wanted a share of fortunes, such as those made by the sale of the commodity tobacco in Virginia, and hoped to recoup some of the financial losses he had sustained in his earlier colonial venture in Newfoundland.      George Calvert died in April 1632, but a charter for "Maryland Colony" (in Latin, "Terra Maria") was granted to his son, Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Lord Baltimore, on June 20, 1632. The new colony was named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I of England.  The name recorded in the charter was phrased "Terra Mariae, anglice, Maryland". The English name was preferred over the Latin due in part to the undesired association of "Mariae" with the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana of the Inquisition.  To try to gain settlers, Maryland used what is known as the headright system, which originated in Jamestown. Settlers were given 50 acres of land for each person they brought into the colony, whether as settler, indentured servant or slave.On March 25, 1634, Lord Baltimore sent the first colonists into this area. Although most of the settlers were Protestants, Maryland soon became one of the few regions in the English Empire where Catholics held the highest positions of political authority. Maryland was also a key destination for transport of tens of thousands of English convicts to work as indentured servants.The royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania. The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. But the terms of the grant clearly indicate that Charles II and William Penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to New Castle, Delaware when it falls north of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682, which might have resolved the issue, was undermined by Penn's receiving the additional grant of what is now Delaware—which previously had been part of Maryland.    The dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century, carried on by the descendants of William Penn and Lord Baltimore—the Calvert family, which controlled Maryland, and the Penn family, which controlled Pennsylvania. 18th centuryThe conflict led to the Cresap's War (also known as the Conojocular War), a border conflict between Pennsylvania and Maryland, fought in the 1730s. Hostilities erupted in 1730 with a series of violent incidents prompted by disputes over property rights and law enforcement, and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737. The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A provisional agreement had been established in 1732. Negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. The agreement defined Maryland's border with what is now Delaware as well as Pennsylvania. The border between Maryland and Pennsylvania was defined as the line of latitude   south of the southernmost house of Philadelphia, a line now known as the  Mason-Dixon Line. Maryland's border with Delaware was based on a Transpeninsular Line and the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle. After Virginia made Anglicanism the established religion in the colony, numerous Puritans migrated from Virginia to Maryland. They were given land for a settlement called Providence (now Annapolis).  In 1650, the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government and set up a new government that prohibited both Catholicism and Anglicanism. In March 1654, the 2nd Lord Baltimore sent an army under the command of Governor William Stone to put down the revolt, but his forces were decisively defeated by a Puritan army near Annapolis in what was to be known as the Battle of the Severn.  During the persecution of Catholics in the Puritan revolt, Protestants burned down all of the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. The Puritan revolt lasted until 1658, when the Calvert family regained control of the colony and re-enacted the Toleration Act. However, after England's "Glorious Revolution" of 1688, when William of Orange came to the throne and established the Protestant faith in England, Maryland outlawed Catholicism. This lasted until after the American Revolutionary War.  Many wealthy Catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy.St. Mary's City was the largest site of the original Maryland colony, and was the seat of the colonial government until 1708. St Mary's is now a historical site, with a small tourist center. In 1708, the seat of government was moved to Providence, which had been renamed Annapolis. The city was renamed in  1694 in honour of Anne then Princess of Denmark, later Queen of England and Scotland, which later in her reign formed Great Britain.Most of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as indentured servants, and had to serve a several years' term as laborers to pay for their passage.  In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed many unions. Mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662. During the colonial era, families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and African men. Many of the free black families migrated to Delaware, where land was cheaper. Paul Heinegg. Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware. Retrieved 15 February 2008.  As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, planters in Maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened. The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted first to the production of tobacco as the commodity crop.Maryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. On February 2, 1781, Maryland became the 13th state to approve the ratification of the Articles of Confederation which brought into being the United States as a united, sovereign and national state. It also became the seventh state admitted to the U.S. after ratifying the new Constitution. In December 1790, Maryland donated land selected by President George Washington to the federal government for the creation of the new national capital of Washington, D.C. The land was provided from Montgomery and Prince George's counties, as well as from Fairfax County and Alexandria in Virginia; however, the land donated by Virginia was later returned to that state by the District of Columbia retrocession.19th centuryDuring the War of 1812, the British military attempted to capture the port of Baltimore, which was protected by Fort McHenry. It was during this bombardment that the Star Spangled Banner was written by Francis Scott Key.Influenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by Methodist and Quaker ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the twenty years after the Revolutionary War. This was a pattern across the Upper South, in which the free black population increased markedly from less than one percent before the war to 13.9 percent by 1810. By 1860 Maryland's free black population comprised 49.1% of the total of African Americans in the state. Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 81–82   This contributed to the state's remaining loyal to the Union during the American Civil War. In addition, Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks temporarily suspended the state legislature, and President Abraham Lincoln had many of its fire eaters arrested prior to its reconvening.In 1861, Federal regular military units and state militia regiments arrived in the President Street Station (built 1849) east of the "Basin" (Inner Harbor) of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and marched through Baltimore, where they were attacked by an unruly mob. The incident was the first bloodshed in the Civil War and has been dubbed the "Baltimore riot of 1861". When the telegraph lines to Washington and an iron railbridge were destroyed by residents of Baltimore, the federal government was isolated in Washington D.C..  During the fighting between civilians and the soldiers from the 6th Massachusetts Regiment (mostly from Lowell, Lawrence, Stoneham, and Methuen) followed by the unarmed "Washington Brigade" of Pennsylvania state militia from Philadelphia (including the unit's band), several soldiers were hit by stones and a musket was fired. The soldiers were ordered to march at double time, and it became a running gun battle. Two Union soldiers were shot and killed, while two others, including Corporal Needham, were knocked from the ranks and beaten to death by the enraged mob. Eventually the Union troops reached the safety of Camden Street Station (built 1857/67) of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. President Abraham Lincoln promised to avoid having more Northern defenders march through Baltimore while getting to areas to protect the acutely endangered Federal Capital. This forced the majority of forces traveling to reinforce the National Capital to take a slow route by boat which Massachusetts militia Gen. Benjamin F. Butler (1818–1893) did several days later after hearing of the bloody reception in Baltimore by commandeering the P. W. & B. Railroad ferryboat "Harriet Lane"  at the Susquehanna River crossing between Perryville in Cecil County to Havre de Grace in Harford County. Avoiding the riotous city, he steamed down the Chesapeake Bay to anchor at night off the Naval Academy at Severn Point in Annapolis and landing his troops of Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island militia over the protests of Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks (1798–1865) after pulling the old Navy training ship frigate  USS Constitution ("Old Ironsides") further off the shore so that southern sympathizers couldn't attack it. Then recruiting some railroad workers and boilermakers among his soldiers, they rescued a small yard locomotive in the trainyards and pushed up the Annapolis Line of the B. & O. Railroad to Relay Junction near Ellicott City where it joined the Main Line going west to Harpers Ferry, Virginia or south to Washington. The Northern regiments shortly arrived in the station by the U.S. Capitol and camped that evening in the Rotunda under the still un-completed dome under construction tending to their wounded. An additional unit was sent up Pennsylvania Avenue to reinforce the White House where President Lincoln awaited with joy and relief. Of the 115,000 men from Maryland who joined the military during the American Civil War, 85,000, or 77%, joined the Union army, while the remainder joined the Confederate Army. To help ensure Maryland's inclusion in the Union, Abraham Lincoln suspended several civil liberties, including the writ of habeas corpus, an act deemed illegal by the Maryland native, Chief Justice Roger Taney of the United States Supreme Court.Lincoln ordered U.S. troops to place artillery on Federal Hill to threaten the city of Baltimore, and helped ensure the election of a new pro-union governor and legislature. Lincoln ordered certain pro-South members of the state legislature and other prominent men jailed at Fort McHenry, including the Mayor of Baltimore, George William Brown. The grandson of Francis Scott Key was included in those jailed. Historians continue to debate the constitutionality of these actions taken during the crisis of wartime. The Thomas Viaduct, which crosses the Patapsco River on the B&O Railroad, was considered so strategically important that Union troops were assigned to guard it throughout the entirety of the war.Because Maryland remained in the Union, it was exempted from the abolition provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, which applied only to states in rebellion. In 1864 the state held a constitutional convention that culminated in the passage of a new state constitution. Article 24 of that document abolished slavery. In 1867, following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to freedmen, the state extended suffrage to non-white males.Demographics The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Maryland was 5,884,563 on July 1, 2012, a 1.9% increase since the 2010 United States Census.   As of 2006, Maryland has an estimated population of 5,615,727, which is an increase of 26,128, or 0.5%, from the prior year and an increase of 319,221, or 6.0%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 189,158 people (that is 464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 129,730 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,017 people.In 2006, 645,744 were counted as foreign born, which represents mainly people from Latin America and Asia. About 4.0% are undocumented (illegal) immigrants.  Maryland also has a large Korean American population.  In fact, 1.7% are Korean, while as a whole, almost 6.0% are Asian. Most of the population of Maryland lives in the central region of the state, in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area and Washington Metropolitan Area, both of which are part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The Eastern Shore is less populous and more rural, as are the counties of western and southern Maryland.The two counties of Western Maryland, Allegany and Garrett, are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia more than they do the rest of Maryland.The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Anne Arundel County and Howard County, in the unincorporated town of Jessup. EthnicityIn terms of race and ethnicity, the state is 58.2% White (54.4% non-Hispanic White alone), 29.4% Black or African American, and 5.5% Asian. Hispanics and Latinos of any race make up 8.2% of the population.  The five largest reported ancestries in Maryland are German (15.7%), Irish (11.7%), English (9%), unspecified American (5.8%), and Italian (5.1%). In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Maryland's population as 17.8% African-American and 80.4% non-Hispanic White. As of 2011, 58.0% of Maryland's population younger than age 1 were minorities.  African-Americans form a sizable portion of the state's population – nearly 30% in 2010    – including many immigrants from Nigeria, particularly the Igbo tribe.  Although populous in most of the state, large concentrations of African-American population can be found in Baltimore City, Prince George's County, Charles County, Randallstown, and the southern Eastern Shore.Most of the Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland are populated by Marylanders of British ancestry, with the Eastern Shore traditionally Methodist and the southern counties Catholic. Western and northern Maryland have large German-American populations. Italians, Poles, Czechs and Greeks are centered mostly in the large city of Baltimore.  Hispanics are numerous in Hyattsville/Langley Park, Wheaton, Bladensburg, Riverdale Park, Gaithersburg and Highlandtown in East Baltimore.  Salvadorans are the largest Hispanic group in Maryland. Other Hispanic groups with significant populations in the state include Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. Though the Salvadoran population is more concentrated in the area around Washington, DC, and the Puerto Rican population is more concentrated in the Baltimore area, all other major Hispanic groups in the state are evenly dispersed between these two areas. Maryland has one of the most diverse Hispanic populations in the country, with significant populations from various Caribbean and Central American nations. Jews are numerous throughout Montgomery County and in Pikesville and Owings Mills northwest of Baltimore. Asian Americans are concentrated in the suburban counties surrounding Washington, D.C., especially evident by a Korean American and Taiwanese American community in Rockville and a Filipino American community in Fort Washington.  Amish/Mennonite communities are found in St. Mary's, Garrett, and Washington counties. Maryland has the fifth largest proportions of racial minorities in the country.    Largest cities, towns and places ReligionMaryland was founded for the purpose of providing religious toleration of England's Roman Catholic minority. Nevertheless, Parliament later reversed that policy and discouraged the practice of Catholicism in Maryland. Due to immigration patterns, Catholics have not been a majority in Maryland since early Colonial times. Nonetheless, Catholicism is the largest single denomination in Maryland.As of the year 2000, the RCMS    reported that the second and third largest denominational groups in Maryland are Mainline Protestant, and Evangelical Protestant. The Catholic Church has the highest number of adherents in Maryland (at 952,389), followed by the United Methodist Church with 297,729 members reported. Judaism is the largest non-Christian religion with 241,000 adherents, or 4.3% of the total population.  The present religious composition of the state is shown below:  Religions in Maryland Christian Other Roman Catholic 24%   Jewish 4% Baptist 18% Other 3% Muslim 1% Methodist 11%   Other Religions 1% Lutheran 6%   Non-Religious 11%  other Protestant 21%     Despite the Protestant majority, Maryland has been prominent in U.S. Catholic tradition, partially because it was intended by George Calvert as a haven for English Catholics. Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U.S. (1789), and Emmitsburg was the home and burial place of the first American-born citizen to be canonized, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. Georgetown University, the first Catholic University, was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland.  The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States, and the Archbishop of Baltimore is, albeit without formal primacy, the United States' quasi-primate, and often a Cardinal.Economy The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Maryland's gross state product in 2006 was US$257 billion.    However, Maryland has been using Genuine Progress Indicator, an indicator of well-being, to guide the state's development, rather than relying only on growth indicators like GDP.   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Maryland households are currently the wealthiest in the country, with a 2009 median household income of $69,272    which puts it ahead of New Jersey and Connecticut, which are second and third respectively. Two of Maryland's counties, Howard and Montgomery, are the third and tenth wealthiest counties in the nation respectively. Also, the state's poverty rate of 7.8% is the lowest in the country.    Per capita personal income in 2006 was US$43,500, 5th in the nation.As of March 2012, the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%. Maryland's economic activity is strongly concentrated in the tertiary service sector, and this sector, in turn, is strongly influenced by location. One major service activity is transportation, centered on the Port of Baltimore and its related rail and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.  Although the port handles a wide variety of products, the most typical imports are raw materials and bulk commodities, such as iron ore, petroleum, sugar, and fertilizers, often distributed to the relatively close manufacturing centers of the inland Midwest via good overland transportation. The port also receives several different brands of imported motor vehicles and is the number two auto port in the U.S. A second service activity takes advantage of the close location of the center of government in Washington, D.C. and emphasizes technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. In addition, many educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The Johns Hopkins University and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, white collar technical and administrative workers comprise 25% of Maryland's labor force, attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the Washington Metro Area where the federal government office employment is relatively high.Maryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial fishing, centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the blue crab, oysters, striped bass, and menhaden. The Bay also has uncounted millions of overwintering waterfowl in its many wildlife refuges. While not, strictly speaking, a commercial food resource, the waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen.Maryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and Piedmont zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, tomatoes, muskmelons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.Manufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20% of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at Sparrows Point, still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, bankruptcies, and company mergers. During World War II the Glenn L. Martin Company (now part of Lockheed Martin) airplane factory near Essex, MD employed some 40,000 people.Mining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some surprisingly near Washington, but these no longer exist.Baltimore City is the eighth largest port in the nation, and was at the center of the February 2006 controversy over the Dubai Ports World deal because it was considered to be of such strategic importance. The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.TaxationMaryland imposes 5 income tax brackets, ranging from 2% to 6.25% of personal income.  The city of Baltimore and Maryland's 23 counties levy local "piggyback" income taxes at rates between 1.25% and 3.2% of Maryland taxable income. Local officials set the rates and the revenue is returned to the local governments quarterly. The top income tax bracket of 9.45% is the fifth highest combined state and local income tax rates in the country, behind New York City's 11.35%, California’s 10.3%, Rhode Island’s 9.9%, and Vermont’s 9.5%. Maryland's state sales tax is 6%. All real property in Maryland is subject to the property tax. Generally, properties that are owned and used by religious, charitable, or educational organizations or property owned by the federal, state or local governments are exempt. Property tax rates vary widely. No restrictions or limitations on property taxes are imposed by the state, meaning cities and counties can set tax rates at the level they deem necessary to fund governmental services. These rates can increase, decrease or remain the same from year to year. If the proposed tax rate increases the total property tax revenues, the governing body must advertise that fact and hold a public hearing on the new tax rate. This is called the Constant Yield Tax Rate process.BiotechnologyMaryland is a major center for life sciences research and development.  With more than 400 biotechnology companies located there, Maryland is the fourth-largest nexus in this field in the United States. Institutions and government agencies with an interest in research and development located in Maryland include the Johns Hopkins University, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, more than one campus of the University System of Maryland, Goddard Space Flight Center, the United States Census Bureau, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Celera Genomics company, Human Genome Sciences (HGS),the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), and MedImmune - recently purchased by AstraZeneca.TransportationThe Maryland Department of Transportation, headquartered in the Hanover area of unincorporated Anne Arundel County,   oversees transportation in the state.Roads Maryland's Interstate highways include   of I-95, which enters the northeast portion of the state, goes through Baltimore, and becomes part of the eastern section of the Capital Beltway to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. I-68 runs   connecting the western portions of the state to I-70 at the small town of Hancock. I-70 enters from Pennsylvania north of Hancock and continues east for   to Baltimore, connecting Hagerstown and Frederick along the way.I-83 has   in Maryland and connects Baltimore to southern central Pennsylvania (Harrisburg and York, Pennsylvania). Maryland also has an   portion of I-81 that runs through the state near Hagerstown. I-97, fully contained within Anne Arundel County and the second shortest (17.6 miles) one- or two-digit Interstate highway which connects the Baltimore area to the Annapolis area. Hawaii has one that is shorter.There are also several auxiliary Interstate highways in Maryland. Among them are two beltways encircling the major cities of the region: I-695, the McKeldin (Baltimore) Beltway, which encircles Baltimore; and a portion of I-495, the Capital Beltway, which encircles Washington, D.C. I-270, which connects the Frederick area with Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia through major suburbs to the northwest of Washington, is a major commuter route and is as wide as fourteen lanes at points.Both I-270 and the Capital Beltway are currently extremely congested; however, the ICC or Intercounty Connector (MD 200) is hoped to alleviate some of the congestion over time. Construction of the ICC was a major part of the campaign platform of former Governor Robert Ehrlich, who was in office from 2003 until 2007, and of Governor Martin O'Malley, who succeeded him. I-595, which is concurrent with US 50 and US 301, is the longest unsigned interstate in the country and connects Prince George's County and Washington D.C. with Annapolis and the Eastern Shore via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.Maryland also has a state highway system that contains routes numbered from 2 through 999, however most of the higher-numbered routes are either not signed or are relatively short. Major state highways include Routes 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway/Solomons Island Road/Southern Maryland Blvd.), 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue/Southern Maryland Blvd./Patuxent Beach Road/St. Andrew's Church Road), 5 (Branch Avenue/Leonardtown Road/Point Lookout Road), 32, 45 (York Road), 97 (Georgia Avenue), 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway), 210 (Indian Head Highway), 235 (Three Notch Road), 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), 355 (Wisconsin Avenue/Rockville Pike/Frederick Road),  404 (Queen Anne Highway/ Shore Highway), and650 (New Hampshire Avenue).Airports Maryland's largest airport is Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (known as Friendship Airport from its construction in 1950 and  renamed in 2005 for Baltimore-born former and first African-American Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall). The only other airports with commercial service are at Hagerstown and Salisbury. The Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also serviced by the other two airports in the region, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Dulles International Airport, both in Northern Virginia.  The College Park Airport is the nation's oldest, founded in 1909, and is still utilized.  Wilbur Wright trained military aviators at this location.  Rail Amtrak trains, including the high speed Acela Express serve Baltimore's Penn Station, BWI Airport, New Carrollton, and Aberdeen along the Washington D.C. to Boston Northeast Corridor. In addition, train service is provided to Rockville and Cumberland by Amtrak's Washington, D.C., to Chicago Capitol Limited.The Washington Metrobus and Metrorail system provides connections between Washington, D.C. and the surrounding counties of Montgomery and Prince George's, as well as BWI Airport provided by the Route B30. MTA Maryland is the largest private operator in the state. Situated in Baltimore and largely focused in central Maryland, portions of the Eastern Shore are served by commuter and express bus service. Baltimore's Light Rail and Metro Subway systems serve the densely populated inner-city and the surrounding suburbs. The commuter rail service, known as MARC, focuses on the connection of Washington Union Station to Baltimore, Perryville, Frederick and as far as Martinsburg, WV.Freight rail transport is handled principally by two Class I railroads, as well as several smaller regional and local carriers. CSX Transportation has more extensive trackage throughout the state, with  , CSX Transportation. Jacksonville, FL (2010). "CSX and Maryland."  followed by Norfolk Southern Railway. Major rail yards are located in Baltimore and Cumberland,  with an intermodal terminal (rail, truck and marine) in Baltimore. The B&O Railroad, which goes from Baltimore to Ohio, is one of the oldest railroads in North America.Shipping canalsThe Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is a   canal on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic. Law and government  The government of Maryland is conducted according to the state constitution. The government of Maryland, like the other 49 state governments, has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States.Power in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Maryland General Assembly is composed of the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate. Maryland's governor is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting. The legislature may not increase the governor's proposed budget expenditures. Unlike most other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland's counties.Most of the business of government is conducted in Annapolis, the state capital. Virtually all state and county elections are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four, in which the President of the United States is not elected – this, as in other states, is intended to divide state and federal politics.The judicial branch of state government consists of one united District Court of Maryland that sits in every county and Baltimore City, as well as 24 Circuit Courts sitting in each County and Baltimore City, the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over $30,000.00, all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings. The intermediate appellate court is known as the "Court of Special Appeals" and the state supreme court is the "Court of Appeals". The appearance of the judges of the Maryland Court of Appeals is unique; Maryland is the only state whose judges wear red robes. Elections Since before the Civil War, Maryland's elections have been largely controlled by the Democrats, even as the party's platform has changed considerably in that time. State elections are dominated by Baltimore and the populous suburban counties bordering Washington, D.C.: Montgomery and Prince George's. Forty-three percent of the state's population resides in these three jurisdictions, each of which contain large, traditionally Democratic voting bloc(s): African Americans in Baltimore and Prince George's, federal employees in Prince George's and Montgomery, and postgraduates in Montgomery. The remainder of the state, particularly Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, is more supportive of Republicans.Maryland has supported the Democratic nominee in each of the last five presidential elections, by an average margin of 15.4%. In 1980, it was one of six states to vote for Jimmy Carter. In recent years, Maryland has been among the most reliable states for Democratic nominees. In 1992, Bill Clinton fared better in Maryland than any other state except his home state of Arkansas. In 1996, Maryland was Clinton's sixth best, in 2000 Maryland ranked fourth for Gore and in 2004 John Kerry showed his fifth best performance in Maryland.  In 2008, Barack Obama won the state's 10 electoral votes in 2008 with 61.9% of the vote to John McCain's 36.5%.While Republicans usually win more counties by piling up large margins in the west and east, they are usually swamped by the more densely populated and heavily Democratic Baltimore-Washington axis.  In 2008, for instance, McCain won 17 counties to Obama's six; Obama also carried Baltimore City.  While McCain won most of the western and eastern counties by margins of 2-to-1 or more, he was almost completely shut out in the larger counties surrounding Baltimore and Washington; every large county except Anne Arundel went for Obama. Both of Maryland's U.S. Senators and seven of its eight Representatives in Congress are Democrats, and Democrats hold a supermajority in the state Senate. The previous Governor, Robert Ehrlich, was the first Republican to be elected to that office in four decades, and after one term lost his seat to Baltimore Mayor Martin J. O'Malley, a Democrat.  Ehrlich ran again for Governor in 2010, losing again to O'Malley.U.S. Congressman Steny Hoyer (MD-5), a Democrat, was elected as Majority Leader for the 110th Congress of the House of Representatives, and 111th Congress, serving in that post from 2007 to 2011. His district covers parts of Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties, in addition to all of Charles, Calvert and St. Mary's counties in southern Maryland. The 2006 election brought no significant change in this pattern of Democratic dominance. After Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes announced that he was retiring, Democratic Congressman Benjamin Cardin defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor Michael S. Steele, with 55% of the vote, against Steele's 44%. The governorship was also a point of interest, as Republican incumbent Robert Ehrlich was defeated by Democratic challenger Martin O'Malley, the Mayor of Baltimore, 53% to 46%.While Maryland is a Democratic Party stronghold, perhaps its best known political figure is a Republican – former Governor Spiro Agnew, who served as United States Vice President under Richard Nixon. He was Vice President from 1969 to 1973, when he resigned in the aftermath of revelations that he had taken bribes while he was Governor of Maryland. In late 1973, a court found Agnew guilty of violating tax laws.In 2010 Republicans won control of most counties. The Democratic Party remained in control of eight county governments including Baltimore City. EducationPrimary and secondary education Public primary and secondary education in Maryland is overseen by the Maryland State Department of Education, which is headquartered in Baltimore.   The highest educational official in the state is the State Superintendent of Schools, who is appointed by the State Board of Education to a four-year term of office. The Maryland General Assembly has given the Superintendent and State Board autonomy to make educationally related decisions, limiting its own influence on the day to day functions of public education. Each county and county-equivalent in Maryland has a local Board of Education charged with running the public schools in that particular jurisdiction.The budget for education was $5.5 billion in 2009, representing about 40% of the state's general fund. Maryland has a broad range of private primary and secondary schools. Many of these are affiliated with various religious sects, including parochial schools of the Catholic Church, Quaker schools, Seventh-day Adventist schools, and Jewish schools. In 2003, Maryland law was changed to allow for the creation of publicly funded charter schools, although the charter schools must be approved by their local Board of Education and are not exempt from state laws on education, including collective bargaining laws.In 2008, the state led the entire country in the percentage of students passing Advanced Placement examinations. 23.4 percent of students earned passing grades on the AP tests given in May 2008. This marks the first year that Maryland earned this honor.  Three Maryland high schools (in Montgomery County) were ranked among the top 100 in the country based on these test scores. Colleges and universities Maryland has several historic and renowned private colleges and universities, the most prominent of which is Johns Hopkins University, founded in 1876 with a grant from Baltimore entrepreneur Johns Hopkins.The first public university in the state is the University of Maryland, Baltimore, which was founded in 1807 and contains the University of Maryland's only public academic health, human services, and one of two law centers (the other being the University of Baltimore School of Law). Seven professional and graduate schools train the majority of the state's physicians, nurses, dentists, lawyers, social workers, and pharmacists.  The largest undergraduate institution in Maryland is the University of Maryland, College Park which was founded as the Maryland Agricultural College in 1856 and became a public land grant college in 1864. Towson University, founded in 1866, is the state's second largest university. Baltimore is home to the Maryland Institute College of Art. The majority of public universities in the state are affiliated with the University System of Maryland. Two state-funded institutions, Morgan State University and St. Mary's College of Maryland, as well as two federally funded institutions, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the United States Naval Academy, are not affiliated with the University System of Maryland.St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland and Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, both private institutions, are the two oldest colleges in the state, and are among the oldest in the country.  Other private institutions include Mount St. Mary's University, McDaniel College (formerly known as Western Maryland College), Hood College, Stevenson University (formerly known as Villa Julie College), Loyola University Maryland, and Goucher College, among others.Sports With two major metropolitan areas, Maryland has a number of major and minor professional sports franchises. Two National Football League teams play in Maryland, the Baltimore Ravens in Baltimore City and the Washington Redskins in Landover. The Baltimore Colts represented the NFL in Baltimore from 1953 to 1983 before moving to Indianapolis.The Baltimore Orioles are the state's Major League Baseball franchise. The National Hockey League's Washington Capitals and the National Basketball Association's Washington Wizards formerly played in Maryland, until the construction of an arena in Downtown D.C. in 1997 (originally known as MCI Center, renamed Verizon Center in 2006).Maryland enjoys considerable historical repute for the talented sports players of its past, including Cal Ripken Jr. and Babe Ruth. In 2012, The Baltimore Sun published a list of Maryland's top ten athletes in the state's history. The list includes Ruth, Ripken, Johnny Unitas, Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Ray Lewis, Michael Phelps, Jimmie Foxx, Jim Parker, and Wes Unseld. Other professional sports franchises in the state include five affiliated minor league baseball teams, one independent league baseball team, the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team, two indoor football teams, and three low-level outdoor soccer teams. Maryland is also home to one of the three races in horse racing's annual Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes, which is run every spring at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.The official state sport of Maryland, since 1962, is jousting; the official team sport since 2004 is lacrosse.  The National Lacrosse Hall of Fame is located on the Johns Hopkins University campus in Baltimore. In 2008, intending to promote physical fitness for all ages, walking became the official state exercise. Maryland is the first state with an official state exercise.

Silver Spring, Maryland Silver Spring is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It had a population of 71,452 at the 2010 census, making it the fourth most populous place in Maryland, after Baltimore, Columbia, and Germantown. The urbanized, oldest, and southernmost part of Silver Spring is a major business hub that lies at the north apex of Washington, D.C. As of 2004, the Central Business District (CBD) held   of office space, 5216 dwelling units and   of parkland. The population density of this CBD area of Silver Spring was 15,600 per square mile all within   and approximately   in the CBD/downtown area. The community has recently undergone a significant renaissance, with the addition of major retail, residential, and office developments.Silver Spring takes its name from a mica-flecked spring discovered there in 1840 by Francis Preston Blair, who subsequently bought much of the surrounding land. Acorn Park, tucked away in an area of south Silver Spring away from the main downtown area, is believed to be the site of the original spring. GeographyAs an unincorporated area, Silver Spring's boundaries are not officially defined. As of the 2010 Census the United States Census Bureau defines Silver Spring as a census-designated place with a total area of  , all land; however, it does contain numerous creeks and small lakes. This definition is a 15% reduction from the 9.4 sq. mi. used in previous years. The United States Geological Survey locates the center of Silver Spring at  , notably some distance from the Census Bureau's datum. By another definition, Silver Spring is located at   (39.004242, -77.019004).  The definitions used by the Silver Spring Urban Planning District, the United States Postal Service, the Greater Silver Spring Chamber of Commerce, etc., are all different, each defining it for its own purposes.Residents of a large swath of south-eastern Montgomery County have Silver Spring mailing addresses. This area extends roughly from the Washington, D.C., Prince George's County, Maryland and Howard County, Maryland lines to the south, east and north, and Rock Creek Park and Plyers Mill Road to the west and north-west. These boundaries make Silver Spring larger in area than any city in Maryland except for Baltimore. Some notable landmarks are the world headquarters of Discovery Communications, the AFI Silver Theatre, the NOAA headquarters, and the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Parks and recreationRock Creek Park passes along the west side of Silver Spring, and offers hiking trails, picnic grounds, and bicycling on weekends, when its main road, Beach Drive, is mostly closed to motor vehicles.Sligo Creek Park follows Sligo Creek through Silver Spring; it offers hiking trails, tennis courts, playgrounds and bicycling. The latter is facilitated on weekends, when parts of Sligo Creek Parkway are closed to autos. The bike trails are winding and slower than most in the region. Recently, rocks have been spread along either side of the road, providing a hazardous bike ride, or skating leisure.Acorn Park in the downtown area of Silver Spring is believed to be the site of the eponymous "silver spring".The   Jesup Blair Park was recently renovated and has a soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts, and picnic area. Brookside Gardens is a   park within Wheaton Regional Park, in "greater" Silver Spring. It is located on the original site of Stadler Nursery (now in Laytonsville, Maryland).Demographics 2010Note: For the 2010 Census the boundaries of the Silver Spring CDP were changed reducing the land area by approx. 15%. As a result, the population count for 2010 shows a 6.6% decrease, while the population density increases 11%. As of the 2010 census, there were 71,452 people, 28,603 households, and 15,684 families residing in the Silver Spring CDP. The population density was 9,021.7 people per square mile (3,485.5/km²). There were 30,522 housing units at an average density of 3,853.8 per square mile (1,488.9/km²). The racial makeup of the community was 45.7% White, 27.8% African American, 0.6% Native American, 7.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 13.2% from other races, and 4.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race consist of 26.3% of the population. Like  much of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, Silver Spring's Hispanic population is mostly made up of Salvadorans and other immigrants from Central America.There were 28,603 households out of which 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.6% were married couples living together, 11.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.2% were non-families. Thirty-three point six percent (33.6%) of all households are made up of individuals living alone and 16.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.21.In the census area, the population was spread out with 21.4% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 37.1% from 25 to 44, 23.8% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.8 years. For every 100 females there were 94.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.2 males.The median income for a household in the census area was $62,187, and the median income for a family was $77,541. Males had a median income of $46,407 versus $49,979 for females. The per capita income for the area was $32,181. 15.0% (+/- 4.9%) of the population and 13.3% (+/-4.3%) of families were below the poverty line. 21% (+/- 9.1%) of those under the age of 18 and 23.6% (+/-10.6%)of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.2000For the 2000 census,  there were 76,540 people, 30,374 households, and 17,616 families residing in the census area (if all areas with the "Silver Spring" address are included, the population swells to around 250,000). The population density was 8,123.6 people per square mile (3,137.2/km²). There were 31,208 housing units at an average density of 3,312.3 per square mile (1,279.1/km²). The racial makeup of the community was 46.61% White, 28.07% African American, 0.44% Native American, 8.22% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 11.55% from other races, and 5.04% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race consist of 22.22% of the population.There were 30,374 households out of which 29.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.8% were married couples living together, 12.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.0% were non-families. Thirty-two point six percent (32.6%) of all households are made up of individuals and 7.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.21.In the census area, the population was spread out with 23.0% under the age of 18, 9.3% from 18 to 24, 37.0% from 25 to 44, 21.2% from 45 to 64, and 9.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 93.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.5 males.The median income for a household in the census area was $51,653, and the median income for a family was $60,631. Males had a median income of $38,124 versus $36,096 for females. The per capita income for the area was $26,357. 9.3% of the population and 6.4% of families were below the poverty line. 11.7% of those under the age of 18 and 9.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.HistoryNineteenth centuryThe Blair, Lee, and Jalloh and Barrie families, three politically active families of the time, are irrefutably tied to Silver Spring's history. In 1840, Francis Preston Blair, who later helped organize the modern American Republican Party, along with his daughter, Elizabeth, discovered a spring flowing with chips of mica (the now-dry spring is still visible at Acorn Park). Two years later, he completed a twenty-room mansion he dubbed Silver Spring on a 250 acre (one-square-kilometer) country homestead situated just outside of Washington, D.C. (The house stood until 1954. ) By 1854, Blair's son, Montgomery Blair, who became Postmaster General under Abraham Lincoln and represented Dred Scott before the United States Supreme Court, built the Falkland house in the area. By the end of the decade, Elizabeth Blair married Samuel Phillips Lee, third cousin of future Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, and gave birth to a boy, Francis Preston Blair Lee. The child would eventually become the first popularly elected Senator in United States history.During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln visited the Silver Spring mansion multiple times. During some of the visits he relaxed by playing town ball with Francis P. Blair's grandchildren.  In 1864, Confederate Army General Jubal Early occupied Silver Spring prior to the Battle of Fort Stevens. After the engagement, fleeing Confederate soldiers razed Montgomery Blair's Falkland residence. By the end of the 19th century, the region began to develop into a town of decent size and importance. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's Metropolitan Branch was completed in 1873 and ran from Washington, D.C. to Point of Rocks, Maryland through Silver Spring. The first suburban development appeared in 1887 when Selina Wilson divided part of her farm on current-day Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and Brookeville Road into five- and ten-acre (20,000- and 40,000 m²) plots. In 1893, Francis Preston Blair Lee and his wife, Anne Brooke Lee, gave birth to E. Brooke Lee, who is known as the father of modern Silver Spring for his visionary attitude toward developing the region. Twentieth centuryThe early 20th century set the pace for downtown Silver Spring's growth. E. Brooke Lee and his brother, Blair Lee I, founded the Lee Development Company, whose Colesville Road office building remains a downtown fixture. Dale Drive, a winding roadway, was built to provide vehicular access to much of the family's substantial real estate holdings. Suburban development continued in 1922 when Woodside Development Corporation created Woodside Park, with 1 acre (4,000 m²) plot home sites. In 1924, Washington trolley service on Georgia Avenue (present-day Maryland Route 97) across B&O's Metropolitan Branch was temporarily suspended so that an underpass could be built. The underpass was completed two years later, but trolley service never resumed. It would be rebuilt again in 1948 with additional lanes for automobile traffic, opening the areas to the north for readily accessible suburban development.Takoma-Silver Spring High School, built in 1924, was the first high school for Silver Spring. The community's rapid growth led to the need for a larger school. In 1935, when a new high school was built at Wayne Avenue and Sligo Creek Parkway, it was renamed Montgomery Blair High School. (The school remained at that location for over six decades, until 1998, when it was moved to a new, larger facility at the corner of Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and University Boulevard (Maryland Route 193). The former high school building became a combined middle school and elementary school.) The Silver Spring Shopping Center and Silver Theatre (designed by noted theatre architect John Eberson) were completed in 1938, at the request of developer William Alexander Julian. The shopping center was unique because it was one of the nation's first retail spaces that featured a street-front parking lot. Conventional wisdom held that merchandise should be in windows closest to the street so that people could see it; the shopping center broke those rules.By the 1950s, Silver Spring was the second busiest retail market between Baltimore and Richmond, with the Hecht Company, J.C. Penney, Sears, Roebuck and Company, and a number of other retailers. In 1954, after standing for over a century, the Blair mansion "Silver Spring" was razed and replaced with the Blair Station Post office. In 1960, Wheaton Plaza (later known as Westfield Wheaton), a shopping center several miles north of downtown Silver Spring opened, and captured much of the town's business. The downtown area soon started a long period of decline.In December 1961, a short segment of the Capital Beltway (I-495) was opened to traffic between Georgia Avenue (MD 97) and University Boulevard East (MD 193).   On Monday, August 17, 1964, the final segment of the   Beltway was opened to traffic,  and a ribboncutting ceremony was held near the New Hampshire Avenue interchange, with a speech by then-Gov. J. Millard Tawes. Washington Metro rail service into Washington, D.C. helped breathe life into the region starting in 1978 with the opening of the Silver Spring station. The Metro Red Line was built following the alignment of the B&O Metropolitan Branch, with the Metro tracks centered between the B&O's eastbound and westbound mains. The Red Line heads south to downtown DC from Silver Spring, running at grade before descending into Union Station.  By the mid-1990s, the Red Line continued north from the downtown Silver Spring core, entering a tunnel just past the Silver Spring station and running underground to three more stations, Forest Glen, Wheaton and Glenmont.Nevertheless, the decline continued in the 1980s, as the Hecht Company, downtown's last remaining department store, closed and opened a new store at Wheaton Plaza. Furthermore, Hecht's added a covenant forbidding another department store from renting its old spot. City Place, a multi-level mall, was established in the old Hecht Company building in 1992, but it had trouble attracting quality anchor stores and gained a reputation as a budget mall, anchored by Burlington Coat Factory and Marshalls, as well as now-closed anchors AMC Theaters, Gold's Gym, Steve and Barry's, and Nordstrom Rack. In the mid-1990s, developers considered building a mega-mall and entertainment complex called the American Dream (similar to the Mall of America) in downtown Silver Spring, but the revitalization plan fell through before any construction began because the developers were unable to secure funding.Another notable occurrence in Silver Spring during the 1990s was a 1996 train collision on the Silver Spring section of the Metropolitan line. On February 16 of that year, during the Friday-evening rush hour, a MARC commuter train bound for Washington Union Station collided with the Amtrak Capitol Limited train and erupted in flames on a snow-swept stretch of track in Silver Spring, leaving eleven people dead.The Maryland State Highway Administration started studies of improvements to the Capital Beltway in 1993,  and have continued, off and on, examining a number of alternatives (including HOV lanes and Express Toll Lanes) since then.Twenty-first centuryAt the beginning of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to see the results of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were completely reconstructed to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called "Downtown Silver Spring." New shops included national retail chains such as Whole Foods Market, a 20-screen Regal Theatres, Men's Wearhouse, Ann Taylor Loft, DSW Shoe Warehouse, Office Depot, and Pier 1 Imports, as well as many restaurants, including Romano's Macaroni Grill, Panera Bread, Red Lobster, Cold Stone Creamery, Fuddruckers, Potbelly Sandwich Works, Baja Fresh, Nando's, and Chick-fil-a. A Borders book store was a popular spot until it closed when the chain went out of business. In addition to these chains, Downtown Silver Spring is home to a wide variety of family-owned restaurants representing its vast ethnic diversity. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a PBS documentary entitled Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb, released in 2002. In 2003, Discovery Communications completed the construction of its headquarters and relocated to downtown Silver Spring from nearby Bethesda. The same year also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as AFI Silver, under the auspices of the American Film Institute. Development continues with the opening of new office buildings, condos, stores, and restaurants, although City Place Mall continues to struggle to fill its vacancies despite the explosive growth around it. The restoration of the old B&O Passenger Station was undertaken between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film Next Stop: Silver Spring.    Beginning in 2004, the downtown redevelopment was marketed locally with the "silver sprung" advertising campaign, which declared on buses and in print ads that Silver Spring had "sprung" and was ready for business.  In June 2007, The New York Times noted that downtown was "enjoying a renaissance, a result of public involvement and private investment that is turning it into an arts and entertainment center". In 2007, the downtown Silver Spring area gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in what appeared to be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Cos., a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited.  In response, Montgomery County Attorney Leon Rodriguez said that the street in question, Ellsworth Drive, "constitutes a public forum" and that the First Amendment's protection of free speech applies there. In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, "Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, we think it is likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment."  The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.In 2008, construction of the long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC), which crosses the upper reaches of Silver Spring, got under way. The highway's first section opened on February 21, 2011; the entire route was completed by 2012.In July 2010, the Silver Spring Civic Building and Veterans Plaza opened in downtown Silver Spring.CultureDowntown Silver Spring hosts several entertainment, musical, and ethnic festivals, the most notable of which are the Silverdocs documentary film festival held each June and hosted by Discovery Communications and the American Film Institute, as well as the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade (Saturday before Thanksgiving) for Montgomery County. The Silver Spring Jazz Festival has become the biggest event of the year drawing 20,000 people to the free festival held on the second Saturday in September.  Featuring local jazz artists and a battle of high school bands, the Silver Spring Jazz Festival has featured such jazz greats as Wynton Marsalis, Arturo Sandoval, Sérgio Mendes, Aaron Neville and such bands as the Mingus Big Band and the Fred Wesley Group.Dining in Silver Spring is also extremely varied, including American, African, Burmese, Ethiopian, Moroccan, Italian, Mexican, Salvadoran, Jamaican, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Thai, Chinese, Indian, and fusion restaurants, as well as many national and regional chains.The Fillmore is a live entertainment and music venue with a capacity of 2000 people. The venue joins the American Film Institute and Discovery Communications as cornerstones of the neighborhood’s exciting, up-and-coming arts and entertainment district. Performances by artists Prince Royce, Minus the Bear, Tyga and many other hip hop acts. In August 2012 R&B singer Reesa Renee launched her album Reelease at the Fillmore.  Silver Spring has many churches, synagogues, temples, and other religious institutions, including the World Headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Silver Spring serves as the primary urban area in Montgomery County and its revitalization has ushered in an eclectic mix of people and ideas, evident in the fact that the flagship high school (Montgomery Blair High School) has no majority group with each major racial and ethnic group claiming a significant percentage.Silver Spring hosts the American Film Institute Silver Theatre and Culture Center, on Colesville Road. The theatre showcases American and foreign films. Discovery Communications, a cable TV and satellite programming company, has its headquarters in downtown, as well. Gandhi Brigade, a youth development media project, began in Silver Spring out of the Long Branch neighborhood. Docs in Progress, a non-profit media arts center devoted to the promotion of documentary filmmaking is located at the "Documentary House" in downtown Silver Spring.  Silver Spring Stage   an all-volunteer community theater, performs in Woodmoor, approximately   north up Colesville Road from the downtown area.  Downtown Silver Spring is also home to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce that includes the National Weather Service; the American Nurses Association; and numerous real estate development, biotechnology, and media and communications companies.Transportation The major roads in Silver Spring are mostly 3-5 lane highways. The Capital Beltway can be accessed from Georgia Avenue (MD 97), Colesville Road (US 29), and New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650).The long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC) (designated Maryland Route 200) toll road was completed in early 2012.  It has interchanges at Georgia Avenue, Layhill Road (MD 182), New Hampshire Avenue, Columbia Pike (as US 29 is known north of Lockwood Drive) and a half-interchange at Briggs Chaney Road. Silver Spring is serviced by the Brunswick Line of the MARC Train, Metrorail Red Line, Metrobus, Ride On, and the free VanGo. The bus terminal at the Silver Spring Rail Station is the busiest in the entire Washington Metro Area, and provides connections between several transit services, including those mentioned above. This transit facility serves nearly 60,000 passengers daily. Construction commenced in October 2008 on the new $91 million Paul S Sarbanes Transit Center which will further expand the station to facilitate the growing demand for public transportation, due to the increase in population in the Silver Spring area. The new center will be a multilevel, multimodal facility which will incorporate Metrobus, Ride On, Metrorail, MARC train, intercity Greyhound bus, and local taxi services under one roof. The Purple Line light rail, being studied by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is planned to service this station, if a final environmental impact statement is completed and funds are secured for it, connecting Silver Spring with Bethesda to the west and then running east to the University of Maryland-College Park and then southeast to the New Carrollton Metro station. In 2008, Gov. Martin O'Malley assigned $100 million of the state budget for planning and engineering of the Purple Line. The MTA estimates the Purple Line could carry 68,000 person-trips per day.  Construction is planned to begin in 2012. In addition to the Silver Spring station, the Washington Metrorail's Forest Glen station is also located in Silver Spring and the MARC train also stops at the nearby Kensington station.EducationSilver Spring is served by a county-wide public school system, Montgomery County Public Schools. Public high schools that serve the region include Montgomery Blair High School, Albert Einstein High School, Wheaton High School, James Hubert Blake High School, Northwood High School, Paint Branch High School, John F. Kennedy High School, Springbrook High School, and Bethesda Chevy Chase High School. Of the public high schools in the region, Montgomery Blair High School is the only one within the Census Designation Place of Silver Spring. It is nationally recognized for its Communication Arts Program and its Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program, the latter of which perennially produces a large number of finalists and semi-finalists in such academic competitions as the Intel Science Talent Search. Notable private schools in the region include The Siena School, Yeshiva of Greater Washington, Torah School of Greater Washington, Nora School, and The Barrie School.A portion of the Montgomery College Takoma Park/Silver Spring campus is located within the Silver Spring boundary, with the rest of the campus located in Takoma Park. The community college is Montgomery County's main institute of higher education.  (The main campus is in the county seat of Rockville.)  Adjacent to the White Oak neighborhood in the outer reaches of Silver Spring is the campus of the National Labor College.  Howard University also has its School of Continuing Education in Silver Spring (its main campus is located nearby in Washington, D.C.). Formerly Sanz School, Medtech Institute is located in Silver Spring and offers training in healthcare, but most notably English as a Second Language. Sanz School started offering English language education in 1939.LibrariesSilver Spring is served by at least five public libraries of which one – the Silver Spring branch of Montgomery County Public Libraries – is located in downtown Silver Spring. Four other libraries are Wheaton, Marilyn J. Praisner (formerly Fairland),  White Oak  and Long Branch.   The Silver Spring library, one of the most heavily used in the Montgomery County system, is being renovated, enlarged, and relocated to Wayne Ave. and Fenton St. as part of the Silver Spring redevelopment plan.EconomyAmong the companies based in Silver Spring are the hotel franchisor Choice Hotels and the media company Discovery Communications.SportsThe Silver Spring Saints Youth Football Organization has been a mainstay of youth sports in the town since 1951. Located in Silver Spring, Maryland, the Silver Spring Saints play home games at St. Bernadette's Church near Blair High School. The club was formed when two local Catholic parishes, St. John the Baptist and St. Andrews, merged their football programs to compete in the Capital Beltway League after the CYO (Catholic Youth Organization) for the Archdiocese of Washington D.C. discontinued its youth football program at the end of the 1994 season. The name "Saints" is derived from the merging of the two Catholic parishes. In 2009, the Saints moved from the Capital Beltway League (CBL) to the Mid-Maryland Youth Football & Cheer League (MMYFCL).Silver Spring is also home to several MCSL swim teams, including Robin Hood, Calverton, Franklin Knolls, Daleview, Oakview, Forest Knolls, Kemp Mill, Long Branch, Stonegate, Glenwood, Rock Creek, and Northwest Branch, Stonegate, Hillandale, and West HillandaleSilver Spring and Takoma Park together host Silver Spring-Takoma Thunderbolts a college wooden-bat baseball team playing in the Cal Ripken, Sr. Collegiate Baseball League.  Home games are played at Montgomery Blair Stadium.The Potomac Athletic Club Rugby team has a youth rugby organization based in Silver Spring.

Prince George's County, Maryland Prince George's County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland, immediately north, east, and south of Washington, D.C. According to a 2011 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a population of 871,233,  and it is the wealthiest African American-majority county in the United States.   Prince George's County is a part of the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area, with its county seat being Upper Marlboro.EtymologyPrince George's County is named after Prince George of Denmark (1653–1708), the husband of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, and the brother of King Christian V of Denmark and Norway. Prince George's County is frequently referred to as "P.G." or "P.G. County", an abbreviation which is viewed as pejorative by some residents. HistoryPre-historyThe Cretaceous Era brought dinosaurs to the area which left a number of fossils, now preserved in a   park in Laurel.   The site, which among other finds has yielded fossilized teeth from Astrodon and Priconodon species, has been called the most prolific in the eastern United States. Post-European settlement historyPrince George's County was created by the Council of Maryland in the Province of Maryland in 1696  from portions of Charles, and Calvert Counties, and a portion was detached in 1748 to form Frederick County. Because Frederick County was subsequently divided to form the present Allegany, Garrett, Montgomery, and Washington counties, all of these counties in addition were derived from what had up to 1748 been Prince George's County.In 1791, portions of Prince George's County were ceded to form the new District of Columbia, along with portions of Montgomery County, Maryland, as well as the parts of Northern Virginia; that were later returned to Virginia.During the War of 1812, the British marched through the county by way of Bladensburg to burn the White House. On their return, they kidnapped a prominent doctor, William Beanes. Lawyer, Francis Scott Key was asked to negotiate for his release, which resulted in his writing the Star Spangled Banner.In April 1865, John Wilkes Booth made his escape through Prince George's County after shooting President Abraham Lincoln. He was on his way to Virginia.Since much of the southern part of the county was tobacco farms that were worked by slaves,  there was a high population of African Americans who unsuccessfully attempted to become part of Maryland politics in the late 19th century.  The population of African Americans declined during the first half of the 20th century, but was renewed to over 50% in the early 1990s when the county again became majority African American. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HITTING 300Washington Post – Friday, April 19, 1996 Author: Larry Fox  The first African American County Executive was Wayne K. Curry, elected in 1994. On July 1, 1997, the Prince George's County section of the city of Takoma Park, Maryland, which straddled the boundary between Prince George's and Montgomery counties, was transferred to Montgomery County.     This was done after city residents voted to be under the sole jurisdiction of Montgomery County, and subsequent approval by both counties and the Maryland General Assembly. This was the first change in Prince George's County's boundaries since 1791, and the first alteration of the boundaries of any county in Maryland since the early 1900s. The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.   GeographyPrince George's County lies in the Atlantic coastal plain, and its landscape is characterized by gently rolling hills and valleys. Along its western border with Montgomery County, Adelphi, Calverton and West Laurel rise into the piedmont, exceeding   in elevation. According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 97.39%) is land and   (or 2.61%) is water. The Patuxent River forms the county's eastern border with Howard, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties.RegionsCounty terrain, culture and demographics differ significantly by location within the county. There are five key regions to Prince George's County: North County, Central County, the Rural Tier, the Inner Beltway, and South County.North CountyNorthern Prince George's County includes Laurel, Beltsville, Adelphi, College Park and Greenbelt.  This area of the county is anchored by the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Laurel has a large Caucasian population and is experiencing a population boom with the upcoming ICC construction.   The key employers are the University of Maryland, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center.  Areas of geographic distinction include Greenbelt Park, a wooded reserve adjacent to the planned environmental community of Greenbelt, and University Park, a collection of historic homes adjacent to the University of Maryland.  Riversdale Mansion, along with the historic homes of Berwyn Heights, Mt. Rainier and Hyattsville are also located in this area.  The hidden Lake Artemesia, a park constructed during the completion of the Washington Metro Green Line, incorporates a stocked fishing lake and serves as the trail-head for an extensive Anacostia Tributary Trails system that runs along the Anacostia River and its tributaries. The south and central tracts of the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center also lie in this part of the county; the north tract lies north of the Patuxent River in Anne Arundel County.Central CountyCentral County, located on the eastern outskirts of the Capital Beltway, consists of Mitchellville, Woodmore, Greater Upper Marlboro, Springdale, and Bowie. According to the 2010 census, it has generally been the fastest growing region of the county.  Mitchellville is named for a wealthy African American family, the Mitchells, who owned a large portion of land in this area of the county.  Central Avenue, a major exit off the I-95 beltway, running east to west, is one of two main roads in this portion of the county. The other major roadway is Old Crain Highway, which runs north to south along the eastern portion of the county. The Newton White Mansion on the grounds is a popular site for weddings and political events.Bowie is best known as a planned Levittown.  William Levitt built traditional homes, as well as California contemporaries along U.S. Route 50, the key highway to the eastern shore and the state capital of Annapolis. Bowie has currently grown to be the largest city in Prince George's County, with more than 50,000 people. It also has a large Caucasian population, compared to much of the county (48% of the population).  Housing styles vary from the most contemporary to century old homes in Bowie's antique district (formerly known as Huntingtown), where the town of Bowie began as a haven for thoroughbred horse racing. Areas of geographic distinction include the Ogden Bowie Mansion, Allen Pond, key segments of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail, as well as planned parks, lakes and walking trails.Rural TierPrince George's rural tier may be found in the area well beyond the Beltway to the east and south of central county, bounded on the north by U.S. Route 50, the west by the communities Accokeek and Fort Washington, and the east by the Patuxent River. Prince George's origins are in this part of the county.  Most of this area contains the unincorporated parishes, villages and lost towns of Prince George's County. Largely under postal designations of "Upper Marlboro" or "Brandywine", in truth the town of Upper Marlboro is more central county in character, though it is the post office location for various rural settlements. (The names of these unincorporated areas are listed below in the towns section of this article). Since 1721 Upper Marlboro has been the county seat of government, with families that trace their lineage back to Prince George's initial land grants and earliest governing officials. Names like Clagett, Sasscer, King James and Queen Anne pepper the streets.The rural tier has been the focus of orchestrated efforts by residents and county government to preserve its rural character and environmental integrity.  Under the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), Patuxent River Park is the largest natural preserve and provides public access for birdwatching and viewing the rural tier's natural waterfront vistas. In season, the park's Jug Bay Natural Area and the Patuxent Riverkeeper in Queen Anne both offer canoeing and kayaking rentals on the Patuxent. The county's largest collection of tobacco planter mansions and preserved homes are in the rural tier, some managed by the M-NCPPC. Many rural tier roads have scenic highway preservation status; a fall drive yields exceptional beauty along the Patuxent valley's Leeland Road, Croom Road, Clagett's Landing Rd., Mill Branch Rd., Queen Anne Rd., and Brandywine Rd. Walking access along roads in this area is very limited, because most property along the roads remains in private ownership. However, walking is much more accessible in the widespread M-NCPPC lands and trails and state holdings in the Patuxent valley, such as Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and Rosaryville State Park, both popular among hikers and mountain bikers. Inner BeltwayThe inner beltway communities of Capitol Heights, District Heights, Forestville, Suitland and Seat Pleasant border the neighboring District of Columbia's northeastern and southeastern quadrants. This region is the most densely populated area of the county, although many communities here saw a decrease in population from 2000 to 2010. A high percentage of its residents are African American. South CountySouth county is a blend of the greenery of the rural tier and the new development of central county. The communities of Clinton, Oxon Hill, Temple Hills and Fort Washington are the largest areas of south county. It is the only portion of Prince George's County to enjoy the Potomac River waterfront, and that geographic distinction has yielded the rise of the National Harbor project: a town center and riverside shopping and living development on the Potomac. The National Harbor has become a major tourist and convention attraction, with significant hotel accommodations, eateries and shopping.  Ferry rides allow trips across the Potomac into Alexandria.  Several historic sites, including Mt. Vernon, can be viewed from the harbor front.  River Road in Fort Washington also yields great views of the Potomac.  Fort Washington Park was a major battery and gives access to the public for tours of the fort, scenic access to the river and other picnic grounds.  Oxon Hill Manor offers a working farm and plantation mansion for touring; His Lordship's Kindness is another major historic home.Adjacent jurisdictionsAnne Arundel County (east)Calvert County (southeast)Charles County (south)Howard County (north)Montgomery County (northwest)Prince George's and Montgomery Counties share a bi-county planning and parks agency in the M-NCPPC and a public bi-county water and sewer utility in the Washington Suburban Sanitary CommissionFairfax County, Virginia (southwest)Alexandria, Virginia (southwest)Washington, DC (west) Federally protected areasFort Washington ParkGreenbelt ParkPatuxent Wildlife Research Refuge (part)Piscataway ParkGovernmentPresidential elections resultsYear Republican Democratic 2008 10.3%	34,246 89.1% 297,654 2004 17.4%	55,532 81.8% 260,532 2000 18.4%	49,987 79.5% 216,119 1996 21.9% 52,697 73.5% 176,612 1992 24.5%	62,955 65.7% 168,691 1988 38.8%	86,545 60.0% 133,816 1984 41.0% 95,121 58.6% 136,063 1980 40.7% 78,977 50.9% 98,757 1976 42.0% 81,027 58.0% 111,743 1972 58.5% 116,166 40.3% 79,914 1968 41.2% 73,269 40.3% 71,524 1964 36.2% 46,413 63.8% 81,806 1960 42.0% 44,817 58.0% 62,013 Since 1792, the county seat has been Upper Marlboro. Prior to 1792, the county seat was located at Mount Calvert, a 76 acre (308,000 m²) estate along the Patuxent River on the edge of what is now in the unincorporated community of Croom.Prince George's County was granted a charter form of government in 1970 with the county executive elected as the head of the executive branch and the county council members as the leadership of the legislative branch. Prince George's County is part of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of the state of Maryland and holds 23 of the 32 total circuit court judges in the circuit (which includes Calvert, Charles, Prince George's, and St. Mary's counties). Fitch Ratings assigned a 'AAA' bond rating to Prince George's County on August 25, 2011, re-affirming the county's stable financial outlook. Earlier in 2011, the County received 'AAA' status from Standard & Poor’s and Moody's.  'AAA' bond ratings are the highest possible bond ratings a jurisdiction can receive.

Garrett County, Maryland Garrett County is the westernmost county of the U.S. state of Maryland. Created from Allegany County, Maryland in 1872 it was the last Maryland county to be formed. It was named for John Work Garrett (1820–1884).     The county has long been part of the media market of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is to the north.  The Maryland–Pennsylvania boundary was surveyed and marked between April 1765 and October 1767 by astronomer Charles Mason and surveyor Jeremiah Dixon.  This boundary is commonly known as the Mason-Dixon Line.   The eastern border with Allegany County was defined by the Bauer Report, submitted to Governor Lloyd Lowndes, Jr. on November 9, 1898.    The Potomac River and State of West Virginia lie to the south and west.  Garrett County lies in the Allegheny Mountains, which here form the western flank of the Appalachian Mountain Range. Hoye-Crest, a summit along Backbone Mountain, is the highest point in Maryland.The Eastern Continental Divide runs along portions of Backbone Mountain. The western part of the county, drained by the Youghiogheny River, is the only part of Maryland within the Mississippi River drainage basin. All other parts of the county are in the Chesapeake Bay basin.Garrett County contains over   of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland.

Garrett County is part of Maryland's 6th congressional district and Oakland is the county seat.HistoryIn the early 20th century, the railroad and tourism started to decline. Coal mining and timber production continued at a much slower pace. Today, tourism has made a dramatic rebound in the county with logging and farming making up the greatest part of the economic base. Due to a cold climate and lack of any large city, Garrett County has remained a sparsely populated rural area. As of the Census  of 2010, there were only 30,097 county residents.Law and governmentGovernmentThe County is governed by an elected Board of County Commissioners (the "Board"), whose three members serve four-year terms and must live in the District they represent. The Board is the traditional form of county government in Maryland and may exercise only such powers as are conferred by the General Assembly of Maryland.   The County is administered under a line organizational method, with the County Administrator responsible for the general administration of County Government. The administration of the County is centralized with the County Administrator responsible for overseeing the financial planning, annual budget process, personnel management, and direction and management of operations within the organization. The county is part of Maryland's 6th congressional district and is the most Republican in the state. The Republican candidate for President has won in each of the last thirteen elections.   In 2008, John McCain carried Garrett County by a 40.2% margin over Barack Obama, with Obama carrying Maryland by a 25.5% margin over McCain.

The county's northwesternmost point is approximately   southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its southeasternmost point is approximately   northwest of Baltimore, Maryland.Garrett County is located entirely within the highland zone of the Appalachian Mountains known variously as the Allegheny Mountains, the Allegheny Plateau, and the Appalachian Plateau.  The county's highest elevations are located along four flat-topped ridges and range to a height of   at Hoye-Crest along Backbone Mountain, the highest point in the state of Maryland.  As is typical in the Allegheny region, broad flats generally lie below the ridge crests at elevations of approximately  .  River valleys are generally narrow and deep, with ravines typically 1,000 to   below surrounding peaks.The county contains over   of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland.  It is drained by two river systems, the Potomac and the Youghiogheny. The Savage River, a tributary of the Potomac, drains about a third of the county.  The Casselman River, a tributary of the Youghiogheny, flows north from the county’s central section into Pennsylvania. The Youghiogheny itself drains the westernmost area of the county and flows north into Pennsylvania, where it empties into the Monongahela River at McKeesport, just south of Pittsburgh.   Geologic points of interestThe Glades: Maryland's largest and most open mountain peatlandThe Glades'   is of great scientific interest because it is an ombrotrophic system (fed solely by rainwater) with peat layers up to   thick, and is one of the oldest examples of mountain peatland in the Appalachians.    On the western edge of the Savage River State Forest along Maryland Route 495 lies Bittinger, Maryland. Named after Henry Bittinger who first settled in the area, other German settlers moved in and took up the fertile farm land. On the eastern edge of Bittinger is one of the largest glades area of Garrett County. Geographically, this is an area which seems to have been affected by the last great ice sheet of North America. Two miles southeast of Bittinger, there is a large deposit of peat moss.Loess DunesIn the Casselman River valley,   south of Grantsville, Maryland and beside Maryland Route 495, one can see remains of geological evidence about the last great ice sheet over North America. A series of low mounds can be seen in the fields on the west side of Maryland Route 495 that are "loess" (wind-blown) material. Apparently, these are the only ones still visible in the northern part of Garrett County.The mounds were formed when a glacier lake existed in the Casselman valley, and the ice around the edges of the frozen lake melted. Wind blew fine grains of earth into the water around the edges where it sank to the bottom, and the mounds were the result of the deposit of this wind-blown material.

Maryland Toleration Act The Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was a law mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian Christians. Passed on April 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies and created the first legal limitations on hate speech in the world. (The colony which became Rhode Island passed a series of laws, the first in 1636, which prohibited religious persecution including against non-Trinitarians; Rhode Island was also the first government to separate church and state.) Historians argue that it helped inspire later legal protections for freedom of religion in the United States. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics, sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of Britain and her colonies.The Act allowed freedom of worship for all trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. It was revoked in 1654 by William Claiborne, a Virginian who had been appointed as a commissioner by Oliver Cromwell and was a staunch advocate for the Anglican Church.  When the Calverts regained control of Maryland, the Act was reinstated, before being repealed permanently in 1692 following the events of the Glorious Revolution, and the Protestant Revolution in Maryland. As the first law on religious tolerance in the British North America, it influenced related laws in other colonies and portions of it were echoed in the writing of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which enshrined religious freedom in American law.Origin of the lawThe Maryland colony was founded by Cecilius Calvert in 1634. Like his father George Calvert, who had originated the efforts that led to the colony's charter, Cecilius Calvert was Catholic at a time when England was dominated by the Anglican Church.  The Calverts intended the colony as a haven for Catholics fleeing England and as a source of income for themselves and their descendants. Holmes, pp 20–22  Many of Maryland's first settlers were Catholic, including at least two Catholic priests, one of whom became the earliest chronicler of the colony's history.  But whatever Calvert's intentions, Maryland was a colony of an Anglican nation. Its charter had been granted by an Anglican king and seems to have assumed that the Church of England would be its official church. Anglican and later Puritan newcomers quickly came to outnumber the early Catholic settlers. Thus, by 1649 when the law was passed, the colonial assembly was dominated by Protestants, and the law was in effect an act of Protestant tolerance for Catholics, rather than the reverse. From Maryland's earliest days, Cecilius Calvert had enjoined its colonists to leave religious rivalries behind. Along with giving instructions on the establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants and Catholics. He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately as possible, so as not to disturb that peace.  The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland's earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment to the rights of man, but did not specifically detail protections for religious minorities of any kind.  Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert's control of Maryland.  In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable.  This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Brugger, p 20  Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649. Finkelman, p 675 DescriptionThe Maryland Toleration Act was an act of tolerance, allowing specific religious groups to practice their religion without being punished, but retaining the ability to revoke that right at any time. It also only granted tolerance to Christians who believed in the Trinity.  The law was very explicit in limiting its effects to Christians:  Settlers who blasphemed by denying either the Trinity or the divinity of Jesus Christ could be punished by execution or the seizure of their lands. That meant that Jews, Unitarians, and other dissenters from trinitarian Christianity were practicing their religions at risk to their lives.  Any person who insulted the Virgin Mary, the apostles, or the evangelists could be whipped, jailed, or fined. Otherwise, trinitarian Christians' right to worship was protected.  The law outlawed the use of "heretic" and other religious insults against them.  This attempt to limit the use of religious slurs and insults has been described as the first attempt in the world to limit the use of hate speech. The law was used in at least one attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658, a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles described in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. Underwood, pp 6–7  He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War. Brugger, p 22 The law had its detractors, even among groups those protected by it. Puritans were concerned that the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were also concerned that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, they were being required to submit to the Pope, whom they considered to be the antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony's sole established church. Repeal and legacyIn 1654, only five years after its passage, the Act was repealed.  Two years earlier, the colony had been seized by Protestants following the execution of King Charles I of England and the outbreak of the English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion.  Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, when the Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a rebellion of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, and it would never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718.  The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenuous enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics.  It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland. While the law did not secure religious freedom, and while it included severe limitations, it was nonetheless a significant milestone. It predates the Enlightenment, which is generally considered to be when the idea of religious freedom took root, and stands as the first legal guarantee of religious tolerance in American and British history. Later laws ensuring religious tolerance and freedom, including the British Act of Toleration of 1689, the Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania, and laws concerning religion in other colonies such as South Carolina, may have been influenced by its example.   According to historian Robert Brugger, "...the measure marked a notable departure from Old World oppression."  It was not until the passage of the First Amendment to the Constitution over a century later that religious freedom was enshrined as a fundamental guarantee,  but even that document echoes the Toleration Act in its use of the phrase, "free exercise thereof". Thus, despite its lack of a full guarantee of religious freedom or broad-based tolerance, the law is, "a significant step forward in the struggle for religious liberty."

Howard County, Maryland Howard County is a county located in the central part of the U.S. state of Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It is considered part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.  In 2010, its population was 287,085. Its county seat is Ellicott City. The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Howard County and Anne Arundel County, in the unincorporated town of Jessup. Due to the proximity of Howard County's population centers to Baltimore, the county has traditionally been considered a part of the Baltimore Metropolitan Area.   Recent development in the south of the county has led to some realignment towards the Washington, D.C. media and employment markets.  The county is also home to Columbia, a major planned community of 100,000 founded by developer James Rouse in 1967.Howard County is frequently cited for its affluence, quality of life, and excellent schools. For 2011, it was ranked the third wealthiest county by median household income in the United States by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Many of the most affluent communities in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, such as Clarksville, Dayton, Glenelg, Glenwood and West Friendship, are located along the Route 32 corridor in Howard County.  The main population center of Columbia/Ellicott City was named 2nd among Money magazine's 2010 survey of "America's Best Places to Live."    Howard County's schools frequently rank first in Maryland as measured by standardized test scores and graduation rates. HistoryIn 1800, the mean center of U.S. population as calculated by the US Census Bureau was found in what is now Howard County. The name of the county honors Colonel John Eager Howard, an officer in the "Maryland Line" of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, commander notably at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina in 1781 among others.  He became the fifth Governor of Maryland whose home was the mansion "Belevedere".  The mansion was located at the intersection of East Chase and North Calvert Streets, north of Baltimore Town, an area also called "Howard's Woods" where the Washington Monument was later erected and the tomey neighborhood Mount Vernon, Baltimore was developed in the 1820s.    The area of western Anne Arundel County was designated the Howard District when Anne Arundel County was divided in 1839.  The Howard District had the same status as a county except that it was not separately represented in the Maryland General Assembly. In 1851, the district became erected officially as Howard County.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.   GeographyHoward County is located in the Piedmont Plateau region, with rolling hills making up most of the landscape.  It is bounded on the north and northeast by the Patapsco River, on the southwest by the Patuxent River, and on the southeast by a land border with Anne Arundel County.  Both the Patapsco and Patuxent run largely through publicly accessible parkland along the county borders.  The Patuxent border includes the Triadelphia and Rocky Gorge reservoirs.According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , the smallest county in Maryland, of which   (or 99.40%) is land and   (or 0.60%) is water.

Columbia, Maryland Columbia is a planned community that consists of ten self-contained villages, located in Howard County, Maryland, United States. It began with the idea that a city could enhance its residents' quality of life. Creator and developer James W. Rouse saw the new community in terms of human values, rather than merely economics and engineering. Opened in 1967, Columbia was intended to not only eliminate the inconveniences of then-current subdivision design, but also eliminate racial, religious, and class segregation.Columbia proper consists only of that territory governed by the Columbia Association, but larger areas are included under its name by the U.S. Postal Service and the census. These include several other communities which predate Columbia, including Simpsonville, Atholton, and in the case of the census, Clarksville. The census-designated place had a population of 99,615 in 2010,    making it the most populous community in Maryland after Baltimore. HistoryIn 1962, Community Research and Development board member Melvin Berman took interest in a 1,032 acre parcel of land assembled by land developer Robert Moxley comprising four farm properties from the Carroll, Kahler, Wix, and his uncle James R. Moxley Sr's families.  Close to 15,000 acres were desired to create a parcel large enough for an envisioned 100,000 person development. Rouse's attorney Jack Jones set up a grid system to secretly buy land through dummy corporations to keep costs low. Moxley's firm Security Realty Company (now Security Development Group Inc),  negotiated most of the land deals for Jones, becoming his best client.   CRD accumulated   , 10 percent of Howard County (located between Baltimore and Washington), from 140 separate owners. The $19,122,622 acquisition was funded by Connecticut General Life Insurance, at an average price of $1,500 per acre ($0.37/m²). In October 1963, the acquisition was revealed to the residents of Howard County, putting to rest rumors about the mysterious purchases. These had included theories that the site was to become a medical research laboratory or a giant compost heap. At this unveiling, James Rouse described Columbia as a planned new city which would avoid the leap-frog and spot development threatening the county. The new city would be complete with jobs, schools, shopping, and medical services, and a range of housing choices. Property taxes from commercial development would cover the additional services with which housing would burden the county. The urban planning process for Columbia included not only planners, but also a convened panel of nationally recognized experts in the social sciences, known as the Work Group. Meeting for two days, twice a month, for half a year, the Work Group suggested innovations for planners in education, recreation, religion, and health care, as well as ways of improving social interactions. Columbia's open classrooms, interfaith centers, and the then-novel idea of a health maintenance organization (HMO) with a group practice of medical doctors (the Columbia Medical Plan) sprung from these meetings. The community's physical plan, with neighborhood and village centers, was also decided. Columbia's "New Town District" zoning ordinance gave developers great flexibility about what to put where, without requiring county approval for each specific project.Columbia was never incorporated; some governance, however, is provided by the Columbia Association, which manages common areas and functions as a homeowner association with regard to private property. The first manager of the Columbia Association was John Estabrook Slayton (d. 1967). For Slayton's contributions to the early planning of Columbia, the community center in the Wilde Lake village, Slayton House, was named for him. Wilde Lake was the first village area to be developed in Columbia; accordingly, the town's first high school was Wilde Lake High School, which opened in 1971 as a "model school for the nation". Constructed in the open classroom style, it was razed in 1994, but reconstructed on the same site in 1996.Two historic buildings in Columbia, Dorsey Hall and Woodlawn, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.    Both were once homes of prominent Howard County citizens.Master planTo achieve the goals set forth by the Work Group, Columbia's Master Plan called for a series of ten self-contained villages, around which day-to-day life would revolve. The centerpiece of Columbia would be The Mall in Columbia and man-made Lake Kittamaqundi.Villages and neighborhoodsThe village concept is aimed to provide Columbia a small-town feel (like Easton, Maryland, where James Rouse grew up). Each village comprises several neighborhoods. The village center may contain middle and high schools. All villages have a shopping center, recreational facilities, a community center, a system of bike/walking paths, and homes. Four of the villages have interfaith centers, common worship facilities which are owned and jointly operated by a variety of religious congregations working together.Most of Columbia's neighborhoods contain single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and apartments, though some are more exclusive than others. The original plan, following the neighborhood concept of Clarence Perry, would have had all the children of a neighborhood attend the same school, melding neighborhoods into a community and ensuring that all of Columbia's children get the same high-quality education.Village – Neighborhoods (in rough order of opening)Wilde Lake – Bryant Woods, Faulkner Ridge, Running Brook, The BirchesHarper's Choice – Longfellow, Swansfield, Hobbit's GlenOakland Mills – Thunder Hill, Talbott Springs, Stevens ForestLong Reach – Phelps Luck, Jeffers Hill, Locust Park, Kendall RidgeOwen Brown – Dasher Green, Elkhorn, HopewellHickory Ridge – Clemens Crossing, Hawthorn, Clary's ForestDorsey's Search – Dorsey Hall, Fairway HillsKings Contrivance – Dickinson, Huntington, Macgill's CommonRiver Hill – Pheasant Ridge, Pointers RunTown Center – Vantage Point, Banneker, Amesbury, Creighton's Run, and Warfield TriangleColumbia takes its street names from famous works of art and literature: for example, the neighborhood of Hobbit's Glen takes its street names from the work of J. R. R. Tolkien; Running Brook, from the poetry of Robert Frost; and Clemens Crossing, from the work of Mark Twain. The book Oh, you must live in Columbia! chronicles the artistic, poetic, and historical origins of the street and place names in Columbia. Columbia todayIn 2006, Money magazine ranked Columbia (together with Ellicott City, its neighbor to the north) #4 out of the 100 "Best Places to Live" in the United States. Money: "Best Places to Live: Columbia"  In 2008, Columbia and Ellicott City were ranked #8 on this list.  In 2010, Columbia and Ellicott City were ranked #2 on this list. In 2012, Columbia and Ellicott City were ranked #8 on this list.Education and librariesColumbia's public schools are operated by the Howard County Public School System. As of the 2007–2008 school year, the following high schools served some part of Columbia: Atholton       Reach   Mills   Hill   Lake   all of these schools also serve students from outside Columbia, as is also the case with some middle and elementary schools.There are no conventional four-year colleges or universities in Columbia, but several other college-level programs have facilities there. Howard Community College is located near the town center, while the University of Phoenix, American Career Institute, Lincoln College of Technology, Loyola University Maryland and Johns Hopkins University have facilities on the east side of town.Howard County Library is consistently top rated among the nation’s public library systems according to Hennen's American Public Library Ratings (HAPLR).  Two of the six branches of the Howard County public library system are in Columbia, including the Central Branch in Town Center and the East Columbia Branch in Owen Brown.HealthMedical care is available in the recently renovated Howard County General Hospital, affiliated with Baltimore's famous Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Columbia Medical Plan was the city's largest health maintenance organization (HMO). In more recent years, however, this plan has divided into separate medical groups that simply share the Twin Knolls buildings. Today, there is a Kaiser Permanente facility located in the Columbia Gateway industrial park.  There are also a number of clinics, such as the Righttime Medical Care center and Patient First.ShoppingThe Mall in Columbia is a large regional shopping mall with five anchor department stores (Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Sears, Macy's, and JCPenney) and over 200 stores and restaurants. Also containing a 14-screen AMC movie theater, an L.L.Bean retail store, a Cheesecake Factory restaurant, and a Bank of America, in an outside extension area, the mall is a societal center for the community and is located in Town Center.There are several other major shopping centers in the Columbia area, including Snowden Square, Columbia Crossing I and II, Dobbin Center, and Gateway Overlook.Columbia's nine "village centers" provide residents with nearby shopping as well, often including supermarkets, gas stations, liquor stores, dry cleaners, restaurants, and hair salons. The village centers are laid out so that individual stores are not visible from the road, unlike traditional strip malls. The arrangement is criticized because it makes it difficult for newcomers and non-residents to know what shopping is available; it is praised for eliminating much of the garishness of roadside America.The village centers have evolved over time. The Oakland Mills Village Center had a traditional Village Center layout—stores located off a central corridor—until its demolition in the late 1990s. It has since been replaced with a more traditional strip mall. The Kings Contrivance Village Center underwent major construction in 2007 and 2008 when a new Harris Teeter supermarket was added to the center, but maintained the original character of stores around a central corridor and plaza.EconomyJames Rouse conceived of a city, not a suburban bedroom community, and a large area on the eastern edge was allocated for industrial purposes. The centerpiece of this aspect of the development was a General Electric appliance plant on a   site. This plant began operations in 1972 and was closed in 1990, with all but   of the property being sold back to HRD. After toxic waste remediation, one section was redeveloped for big box retail; the remainder became the large Gateway Commerce office complex, still being expanded.  There is still a smaller industrial area to the south of this, but by and large East Columbia is dominated by commercial real estate: office, retail, and wholesale. This is somewhat in contrast to the original plan, which saw the Town Center area as the commercial center of Columbia. The U.S. federal government is the source of many jobs for Columbians. Several large U.S. Department of Defense installations and R&D facilities surround Columbia, the largest being the National Security Agency at Fort George G. Meade, and the Applied Physics Laboratory, both pre-dating the establishment of Columbia. Companies which have had research facilities in the area include W.R. Grace and Company and Westvaco. Further afield, many Columbians commute to government and government contractor jobs in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area. Companies based in Columbia include W.R. Grace and Company,  "Columbia CDP, Maryland." U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on February 26, 2010.  Sourcefire, PetMeds, MICROS Systems, Martek Biosciences, Integral Systems, Corporate Office Properties Trust and the consumer research company Arbitron.  When MaggieMoo's was an independent company, its headquarters was in the Columbia CDP.  RecreationRecreation has always been an important part of the Columbia concept. The homeowners association, the Columbia Association, known to Columbians as "CA," builds, operates and maintains most of these facilities. CA operates a variety of recreational facilities, including 23 outdoor swimming pools, six indoor pools, two water slides, ice and roller skating rinks, an equestrian center, a sports park with miniature golf, a skateboard park, batting cages, picnic pavilions, clubhouse and playground, three athletic clubs including the 24/7 Supreme Sports Club, numerous indoor and outdoor tennis, basketball, volleyball, squash and racquetball courts, and running tracks. In February, 2006, LifeTime Fitness (a Minnesota company) opened a 24/7 health club  at the edge of the Columbia Gateway industrial park. This facility includes one outdoor and two indoor pools (with water slides), racquetball courts, basketball courts, fitness equipment, and pilates and yoga facilities.There are three lakes (Lake Kittamaqundi, Lake Elkhorn, and Wilde Lake) surrounded by parkland for sailing, fishing, and boating;   of paths for jogging, strolling and biking; and 148 tot lots and play areas.Nine village centers, 15 neighborhood centers, and four senior centers provide space for a large variety of community activities. There are a variety of fairs and celebrations throughout the year, including entertainment on the lakefront of Lake Kittamaqundi during the summer and the Columbia Festival of the Arts.Columbia also has garden plots for rent, under the guidance of the Columbia Gardeners, which has been in existence since the 1970s. There are about 350 garden plots at three sites in Columbia, with each garden rented for a nominal fee (currently $30 per year). (Columbia Flyer, Doug Miller "Turning over a new leaf could be growing concern", May 31, 2007, page 17)The Rev3 Triathlon is held every October  in Columbia. It is a major national event, both half iron and full ironman distances.Entertainment/performing artsIn the absence of nightclubs, Columbia relies on local bars to bring in bands. Clyde's (near the Columbia Mall and on Lake Kittamaqundi), Sonoma's (in Owen Brown), along with Nottingham's Tavern and The Green Turtle (near Dobbin Center) regularly bring in groups to perform.Merriweather Post Pavilion, a well-known outdoor concert venue, attracts many prominent performers. In addition, there are several performing arts organizations that present professional theater, including Toby's Dinner Theatre, which has produced the area premieres of several musicals.TransportationColumbia's initial plan called for a minibus system connecting the village centers on a distinct right-of-way. This was never constructed, though minibuses were operated by the Columbia Association under the name ColumBus. These were eventually taken over by Howard County. Six Howard Transit bus routes now serve Columbia and connect it with its neighboring areas (such as Ellicott City and BWI Airport), while several Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) routes provide access to and from both Washington and Baltimore. MTA weekday commuter bus service connects Columbia to the Washington Metro system. There are no rail stations within Columbia, although the Dorsey MARC Train station is served by Howard Transit buses.Columbia has a number of roadways that serve the city: U.S. Route 29, Interstate 95, MD 32, MD 108, MD 100, and MD 175.  All of these highways allow Columbia access to nearby Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Annapolis.GeographyThe center of Columbia is located at  . However, because it is unincorporated, there is confusion over its exact limits. On the strictest definition, Columbia consists only of the land governed under covenants by the Columbia Association. This is a considerably smaller area than the census-designated place (CDP) as defined by the United States Census Bureau, which has a total area of  , of which   is land and   of it (0.80%) is water.  The CDP includes a number of older communities which do not lie within the CA's purview, including the Holiday Hills, Diamondback, and Allview subdivisions and the former town of Simpsonville, as well as some land on the east side of Clarksville. These areas are not part of the "new town", and are not directly served by its amenities. Some of these areas are included in Columbia ZIP codes by the post office, and some are not.The city lies in the Piedmont region of Maryland, with its eastern edge at the fall line. The climate is that of central Maryland, tending to hot, humid summers and cool to cold and wet winters. The primary landforms in Columbia are rolling hills and stream valleys; Columbia's road network is laid out to follow the terrain, with many winding streets and cul-de-sacs. Elevations range from about   above sea level. Most of Columbia is drained by the Middle Patuxent and Little Patuxent rivers. There are three artificial lakes, created by damming of tributary streams during city construction. Along with Symphony Woods, many other stands of mature trees have been maintained in Columbia, including the large Middle Patuxent Environmental Area in the western part of the city between Harper's Choice and River Hill villages, protecting much of the river valley from development.ClimateColumbia has a humid subtropical climate, with brisk winters and hot, muggy summers.

Takoma Park, Maryland  Takoma Park is a city in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is a suburb of Washington, D.C., and part of the Washington Metropolitan Area. Founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1890, Takoma Park, informally called "Azalea City," is a Tree City USA and a nuclear-free zone. A planned commuter suburb, it is situated along the Metropolitan Branch of the historic Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, just northeast of Washington. It is governed by an elected mayor and six elected councilmembers, who form the city council, and an appointed city manager, under a council-manager style of government. The city's population was 16,715 at the 2010 national census.   HistoryTakoma Park was founded by Benjamin Franklin Gilbert in 1883.    It was one of the first planned Victorian commuter suburbs,  centered on the B&O railroad station in Takoma, D.C., and bore aspects of a spa and trolley park. Gilbert's first purchase of land was in the spring of 1884 when he bought the   Grammar farm, which was known as Robert's Choice.  This plot of land was located on both sides of the railroad station, roughly bounded by today's Sixth Street on the west, Aspen Street on the south, Willow Avenue on the east, and Takoma Avenue on the north.  At its founding, lots were sold for $327 to $653 per acre.    Gilbert purchased another plot of land in 1886.  The land was roughly bounded by Caroll Avenue to the Big Spring (now Takoma Junction) and what is now Woodland Avenue.  Gilbert named this land New Takoma.  Gilbert later purchased the Jones farm and the Naughton farm, which together he named North Takoma. Gilbert hired contractor Fred E. Dudley to build many of the home in Takoma Park. One of the homes built by Dudley was the home of Cady Lee,  which still stands today at Piney Branch Road and Eastern Avenue. Dudley's son Wentworth was the first child born in Takoma Park.   By 1888, there were 75 houses built in the community,  and the number increased to 235 homes by 1889.  The deed of each of the original houses prohibited alcohol from being made or sold on the property,     a prohibition that continued in the city until 1983.  Takoma Park incorporated as a town on April 3, 1990. Many of the streets were originally known as avenues.  When the Commissioners of the District of Columbia mandates a District-wide street-naming system, those on the District side were renamed streets but retained their names otherwise.  Other streets in Takoma D.C. were renamed entirely. Susquehanna Avenue became Whittier Street. Tahoe Street was renamed Aspen Street. Umatilla Street became Aspen Street. Vermilion Street became Cedar Street. Wabash Street was renamed Dahlia Street. Aspin became Elder Street. Magnolia Street became Eastern Avenue. In 1904, the Seventh-day Adventist Church purchased five acres of land in Takoma Park along Carroll Avenue, Laurel Avenue, and Willow Avenue.    The land was located on both sides of the Maryland-District of Columbia border.  The land was intended for a church, office building, printer, and residences for prominent members of the church.  In 1903, the Seventh-day Adventist Church decided to move their headquarters to the Washington area after its headquarters' publishing house in Battle Creek, Michigan, had burned to the ground.  The church decided that moving to a more urban setting would be a more appropriate place from which to increase the church's presence in the southern states.  The church purchased fifty acres of land along Sligo Creek in Takoma Park to build the new headquarters.  The land was away from downtown Washington and had clean water available from a natural spring located at present-day Spring Park.    For many decades Takoma Park served as the world headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church,  until it moved to northern Silver Spring in 1989. In 1964, an inside-the-Capital-Beltway extension of Interstate 70S, also known as the North Central Freeway, was proposed via a route known as "Option #11 Railroad Sligo East," up to 1/4 mile parallel to the B&O railroad upon a swath of land displacing 471 houses, that would have cut the city in two. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the future Mayor and civil rights activist Sam Abbott led a campaign to halt freeway construction and replace it with a Metrorail line to the site of the former train station, and worked with other neighborhood groups to halt plans for a wider system of freeways going into and out of DC. This controversy also raised the profile of Takoma Park at a time in the late 1960s and 1970s when it was becoming noted regionally and nationally for political activism outside the Nation's capital, with newspaper commentators describing it as "The People's Republic of Takoma Park" or "The Berkeley of the East".   Also dividing the community is the boundary line of the District of Columbia, which contains part of the original Gilbert tract. This area is now known as Takoma, D.C. While politically separate from Takoma Park, Maryland, it shares its history and much of its culture.Much of the old town Takoma Park was incorporated into the Takoma Park Historic District; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.Before 1995, the eastern boundary of the city of Takoma Park was in Prince George's County, Maryland, causing the community to be divided across two counties and the Maryland/D.C. line (where the original downtown area is located). For several years, Takoma Park lobbied the State of Maryland for legislation allowing county boundaries to be adjusted. The State finally agreed to this change, with the stipulation that cross-county municipalities would no longer be allowed; the new municipal boundary would forever remain within the county of its choosing. In August 1995, after passage of the law, the city held a public referendum asking registered voters living in three Prince George's County neighborhoods north of New Hampshire Avenue whether they wanted to be annexed to the city of Takoma Park. There was a majority of votes, 211 out of 304, in favor of annexation to the city. In November 1995, the State-sponsored referendum was held asking whether the portions of the city in Prince George's County should be annexed to Montgomery County, or vice versa. The majority of votes in the referendum were in favor of unification of the entire city in Montgomery County.  Following subsequent approval by both counties' councils and the Maryland General Assembly, the county line was moved to include the entire city into Montgomery County (including territory in Prince George's County newly annexed by the city) on July 1, 1997.    This process became known as Unification (see the Takoma Voice's 10-year retrospective on Unification).The city has experienced substantial gentrification in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), with many group houses containing accessory apartments being converted back into single-family homes. This process was encouraged by an M-NCPPC "phase back", effectively eliminating scattered-site multifamily housing and implementing single-use zoning citywide, which prompted calls by some residents  for the city to have its own planning authority. The majority of the city's population remain tenants, many of whom live in a cluster of high-rise and mid-rise apartment buildings surrounding Sligo Creek, which cuts a deep valley through the community.GeographyTakoma Park sits on the edge of the Mid-Atlantic fall line and is thus quite hilly, with many narrow, gridded streets.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.    Sligo Creek and Long Branch (both tributaries of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River) flow through the area. Sligo Creek Park and the   Sligo Creek Trail bisect the area. The main street, Carroll Avenue, and the main state highway, Route 410/East West Highway, narrow to two lanes within city limits. Takoma Park has an extensive hardwood tree canopy which is protected by local ordinance.Takoma Park is bounded by downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, a major urban center to the northwest, by Montgomery College campus; East Silver Spring, a community of houses, apartments and small shops, along Flower Avenue and Piney Branch Road, to the north; Langley Park, Maryland, a community of apartments and shopping centers, along University Boulevard to the northeast; Chillum, Maryland, in Prince George's County to the southeast, bounded by New Hampshire Avenue, a state highway; and Takoma, Washington, D.C. to the southwest, separated by Eastern Avenue, which follows the District of Columbia line.The corner of Eastern and Carroll Avenues roughly marks the center of the old commercial district. Other town centers include: "Takoma Junction", the corner of Carroll Avenue and Route 410 in the geographic center of town, home to the city's large food co-op; Takoma-Langley Crossroads in downtown Langley Park, and the Flower shopping district, both of which are home to many immigrant-owned establishments. Takoma Park's municipal center is located at the corner of Maple Avenue and Route 410. Washington Adventist University marks the corner of Carroll and Flower Avenues.Demographics2010 censusAs of the census    of 2010, there were 16,715 people, 6,569 households, and 3,904 families residing in the city.

It has been in existence since 1978, founded by Sam Abbott, former Mayor of the city and civil-rights activist.  In addition to hosting concerts on several stages by musicians from around the world, the festival also celebrates cultural diversity of the region, with a wide variety of ethnic food and crafts.The festival features numerous varieties of music from local and national artists, including blues, klezmer, bluegrass, Celtic, and hip-hop, and traditional music and dance from around the world. Other performers specialize in traditional and progressive folk music. In addition to music and dance, the festival features traditional storytellers from around the world. Takoma Park is notable for being the home of Takoma Records, a nationally-known blues label started by blues guitarist John Fahey, who (together with other local music institutions) popularized the city as a haven for folk musicians.  Mary Chapin Carpenter, Al Petteway (composer of Sligo Creek) and many other prominent local and national artists have made their home in and around Takoma Park. Root Boy Slim and Goldie Hawn are from Takoma Park.Other annual festivals include the mildly countercultural Takoma Park Street Festival, the Takoma Jazz Fest, the Takoma Park Independent Film Festival, and the Takoma Park Fourth of July Parade, which is attended by residents and neighboring politicians from across the metropolitan region.  The parade typically includes ethnic musical troupes representing a wide variety of global cultures, neighborhood performance troupes, and groups supporting causes, such as LGBTQ and fair trade, reflecting Takoma Park's historic reputation for activism.Immediately adjacent to the downtown, Takoma, D.C. is home to the A.Salon Building, a large art studio warehouse and former printing plant, which is home to the backstage office and rehearsal center for the Washington Opera. Two (currently vacant) freestanding theaters, the Takoma Theater and the Flower Theater, anchor either end of town. Takoma Park is also home to the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange and the Institute of Musical Traditions, a performance society founded by the House of Musical Traditions. Kinetic Artistry, a notable theatre supplier for the Washington area, is also located in Takoma Park. A Historic Takoma Museum is under construction by the local historic society.  The Takoma Theatre Conservancy is an organization attempting to renovate the 500-seat Takoma Theatre for multiuse purposes. Meno, Mike. Grants offer hope for Takoma Theatre renewal. Maryland Gazette. 2008-07-16. Takoma Park has been home to a variety of local characters who have contributed to the city's sense of identity and culture, including "Catman" and Motor Cat,  Roscoe the Rooster,  The Banjo Man,  and "Fox Man",  a local animal rights activist and founder of the city's Tool Library. Takoma Park also has a year round farmer's market and two other farmers markets which sell local produce and free range meats.Underground filmmaker Nick Zedd grew up in Takoma Park and made his first movies there.InstitutionsThe Sam Abbott Citizens Center, Takoma Park's former city auditorium, has been refurbished as a community theater and gallery.  The municipal center, which includes the Takoma Park City Hall, Citizens Center and the Takoma Park Maryland Library, was expanded into a community center from 2003-2007.  A gymnasium was requested by the city's youth sports leagues after lobbying from Steve Francis, the NBA basketball player, who grew up in Takoma Park; but funding was not identified. In 2010, the Seventh-Day Adventist Church received authorization to relocate the regional Washington Adventist Hospital from the center of town to an outlying area of nearby Silver Spring, Maryland, alongside its international headquarters and the Adventist Book and Health Food Store, which had also been located within city limits. This had followed an effort by county officials to close or relocate the city's fire station, located on the side of a steep hill. Due to resulting controversy, the City Council lobbied to retain the old Hospital facility as a "health campus." The hospital had been in operation for over a century,  having been founded as the Washington Sanitarium overlooking Sligo Creek, shortly after the church's relocation from Battle Creek, Michigan.  Officials also successfully lobbied to retain a university located on the same campus, which has been renamed Washington Adventist University.In the 1970s, the city experienced controversy over plans to expand or relocate Montgomery College, which has a campus located in the historic district of North Takoma, an area of large old homes adjacent to downtown Silver Spring. This debate was subsequently resolved when the County agreed to preserve the existing campus, and expand in the direction of downtown Silver Spring by building a bridge across the B&O railroad tracks. It was renamed the "Takoma Park-Silver Spring Campus," focused on health, nursing and the arts. The expanded campus included a major new arts center located in South Silver Spring, near the boundary between the three jurisdictions.   The Washington Adventist Hospital will be moving to an alternate location within the next five years.The Takoma Park-Silver Spring Food Co-op is one of the Washington area's largest food co-ops.In the late 2000s (decade), regional and national debate occurred over the decision to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Takoma, D.C., and relocate its operations to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. Takoma Park Soccer Club is the sponsor of many youth soccer teams in the Takoma Park area; such as the TAPK United, coached by professional Brazilian coach Manilton Santos. They are a team who have won many games and earned the affectionate nickname Tapioca United.Law and government Takoma Park's electorate and its elected officials are known for their liberal and left-of-liberal values, which have led to the enactment of several municipal laws.  For instance, Takoma Park allows non-U.S.-citizen residents to vote in its own municipal elections. The city was also forbidden, by statute, from doing business with any entity having commercial ties with the government of Burma (Myanmar),  though after a United States Supreme Court decision struck down a similar Massachusetts provision, enforcement of the provision was suspended in the year 2000. As of 2007, the Free Burma Committee is inactive.  In 2008, the city unanimously approved a resolution to oppose foie gras.  Takoma Park is noted for being a "Nuclear Free Zone" along with cities including Berkeley, California; Cleveland Heights, Ohio; and Madison, Wisconsin. It has an active Nuclear Free Zone Committee that advocates for nuclear disarmament and is entrusted with making purchasing recommendations to the city. Employees are forbidden from purchasing from companies involved in the production of nuclear weapons or their components. Contractors working for the city must also sign a notarized document that they are not "engaged in the development, research, production, maintenance, storage, transportation and/or disposal of nuclear weapons or their components."  Waivers have been given in the past, including a waiver to purchase a library system from Userful corporation that includes computers made by Hewlett-Packard, a company that has also worked on nuclear weapons programs for the United States government.     Because Takoma Park is a certified Tree City, its residents must obtain a permit from the City arborist to cut down any tree on their property measuring more than 8 inches in diameter. This has contributed to the preservation of second-growth hardwood forest which covers much of the city, as is visible in satellite photos.Takoma Park is chartered with its own police force, public works department, housing department, and recreation department. It has also historically maintained its own Volunteer Fire Department and Municipal Library. Until 2007, the city operated a Tool Library as well, and continues to operate its own compost recycling program and silo for corn-burning stoves. As one of the most urbanized areas outside Washington, D.C., Takoma Park is densely developed with narrow houses on deep lots, often featuring mid-block developments and a mix of apartments and homes which are no longer permitted under regional suburban zoning laws, under which many apartments were de-zoned in 1989. Development and reconstruction of the fire station and other public facilities have been highly controversial , with some advocating that facilities be closed and moved to outlying, automobile-friendly areas.MayorTakoma Park is governed by a city council composed of a mayor and council members for each of six wards. The current Mayor of Takoma Park is Bruce Williams.Former mayors are:Benjamin Franklin Gilbert (1890–1892)Enoch Maris (1892–1894)Samuel S. Shedd (1894–1902)John B. Kinnear (1902–1906)Wilmer G.

With this, Takoma Park joins a small but growing number of municipalities across the nation who have chosen IRV, such as San Francisco, California and Ferndale, Michigan.In the 2009 election, Takoma Park used the Scantegrity voting system. This marked the first time an open source voting system was used in a public sector election in the United States, as well as the first time a system with end-to-end verifiability was used.TransportationTakoma Park's Metrorail station sits in the heart of the old downtown area, at the terminus of Carroll Street NW, main street of the Old Takoma area (continuing as Carroll Avenue in Maryland) on the D.C. side two blocks from the Maryland line.  The Takoma Metro station is noted for having one of the highest pedestrian mode shares of any non-central business district station in the Washington Metrorail system.   New Hampshire Avenue is the only six-lane thoroughfare running through city limits, continuing into central Washington, D.C. and primarily serving through-traffic to the east of the city. Other major roads narrow to two lanes within city limits, including Route 410/East West Highway, a major state thoroughfare, and Piney Branch Road, which was narrowed from four lanes to two within city limits as a result of a traffic calming measure.  The primary route into D.C. is Georgia Avenue, the main turnpike through downtown Silver Spring, and Blair Road, a two-lane road (formerly part of the Montgomery Blair estate) which becomes North Capitol Street, a six-lane boulevard to the south. University Boulevard, the major suburban shopping strip, skirts the area to the northeast. Carroll Avenue ends two miles short of the Washington Beltway/I-95 interchange.While the   Sligo Creek Trail is primarily used for recreation by bicyclists and pedestrians, the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is sponsoring efforts to construct the Metropolitan Branch Trail, a rail trail in D.C. parallel to the Red Line, to connect Washington Union Station to Silver Spring and Bethesda, Maryland by way of the   Capital Crescent Trail for bicycle commuting purposes.EducationPrimary and secondary schoolsPublic schoolsThe city is served by the Montgomery County Public Schools.ElementaryElementary schools that serve the city include:Piney Branch Elementary School (3-5)Rolling Terrace Elementary School (PK-5)Sligo Creek Elementary School (K-5)Takoma Park Elementary School (PK-2)Most Takoma Park residents are zoned to Takoma Park ES and Piney Branch.MiddleMiddle schools that serve the city include:Silver Spring International Middle SchoolTakoma Park Middle School (most Takoma Park residents are zoned to Takoma Park MS)HighAll of the city is served by Montgomery Blair High School.Takoma Academy, a private high-school, is located in Takoma Park and is part of the Adventist Educational System.With the Downcounty Consortium, students have limited opportunity to enroll in one of four other schools, including Kennedy, Northwood, Einstein, and Wheaton.Colleges and universitiesWashington Adventist University, a private liberal arts universityMontgomery College (Takoma Park/Silver Spring Campus) (a 2-year institution)LibrariesTakoma Park Maryland Library is one of the few municipal libraries in suburban Maryland.Takoma Park Library, part of the District of Columbia Public Library system, was the first neighborhood library in Washington, D.C. and a Carnegie library.

In front of the station, there are a plethora of festivities that go on, mainly seasonal activities such as housing the town Christmas tree, decorating the plaza for a holiday, and sometimes parties.Main Street of Oakland consists mainly of historic two to four story buildings that house the main shopping in the area, such as a theatre, museum, book store, a local pharmacy, antique shops, clothing stores and banks. Many of the homes and businesses in the downtown area are examples of Victorian architecture. Much of the central section of Oakland is part of the Oakland Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.    Also listed on the National Register are the Garrett County Courthouse and Hoye Site. One of the most prominent and historic churches in Oakland is St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, where U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, James Garfield, Grover Cleveland, and Benjamin Harrison have all attended services. Because of this, it is now called the "Church of Presidents." A large neoclassical courthouse is also very prominent and dominates the town center.In the late 19th century and early 20th century, a large hotel named the Oakland Hotel was located near the downtown train station. It was constructed in 1878 by the B&O Railroad.  The hotel was a major tourist attraction for that time period until it was torn down in the early 20th Century.GeographyOakland is in the south-central to western portion of Garrett County, located at   (39.410480, -79.404380) .

Frederick, Maryland Frederick is a city in north-central Maryland, and is the county seat of Frederick County, the largest county by area in the state of Maryland. Frederick is an outlying community of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of a greater Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area. The city's population was 65,239 people at the 2010 census.Frederick is home to Frederick Municipal Airport (IATA: FDK), which primarily accommodates general aviation traffic, and to the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick military installation, the largest employer in the county focusing on multiple bioscience and communications programs. History Colonial era“Frederick Town” was laid out by Daniel Dulany — a land speculator — in 1745;  it was settled by a German immigrant party led by a young German Reformed schoolmaster from the Rhineland Palatinate named Johann Thomas Schley (d. 1790), who came to the Maryland colony with his wife, Maria Winz. Schley built the first house of the new town; as late as the 20th century, it stood at the northwest corner of Middle Alley and East Patrick Street. The settlement was founded upon a tract of land granted by Dulany on the banks of Carroll Creek. Within three years, the settlement had become the county seat of Frederick County. It is uncertain which Frederick the town was named for, but the likeliest candidates are Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (one of the proprietors of Maryland ),Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales,  and Frederick "The Great" of Prussia.Most sources favor Calvert  .The settlers founded a German Reformed Church (today the church is known as Evangelical Reformed Church, UCC), which also served as a public school, in keeping with the German Reformed tradition of sponsoring universal public education. Many Pennsylvania Dutch (ethnic Germans) settled in Frederick as they migrated westward in the late 18th century. Frederick was a stop along the German migration route that led down through the "Great Valley" (Shenandoah Valley, etc.) to the western Piedmont in North Carolina.The city served as a major crossroads from colonial times. British General Edward Braddock marched west in 1755 through Frederick on the way to the fateful ambush near Fort Duquesne (later Fort Pitt, then Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania during the French and Indian War. To control this crossroads during the American Revolution, the British garrisoned a German Hessian regiment in the town during   Afterward, with no way to return to their homeland, the men of the Hessian regiment stayed on and married into the families of the town, strengthening its German identity. When President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the building of the National Road from Baltimore to St. Louis (eventually built to Vandalia, the territorial capital of Illinois by the 1850s), the "National Pike" ran through Frederick along Patrick Street. (This later became US Route 40.)Early 19th centuryFrom these early beginnings, Frederick grew to an important market town, but by the first third of the 19th century, the town had also become one of the leading mining counties of the United States, producing gold, copper, limestone, marble, iron and other minerals. As early as the American Revolution, Catoctin Furnace near Thurmont had been a significant site for iron production.  In 1831 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) completed its Frederick Branch line from the Frederick or Monocacy Junction off the main Western Line from Baltimore westward to Harpers Ferry, Cumberland, the Ohio River, and eventually Chicago and St. Louis by the 1850s. When the first wave of Irish refugees from the potato famine settled in the city in 1846, one of the leading members of the Schley family married into the Wilson family from Ireland. Consequently, many of the Schleys converted to Catholicism, and residents of Frederick began to speak English for the first time in the town's history — up until then, the language had been German.  Frederick was known during the nineteenth century for its religious pluralism, with one of its main thoroughfares, Church Street, hosting half a dozen major churches. The main Catholic church, St. John's, was built in 1800, then rebuilt in 1837 (across the street) one block north of Church Street on East Second Street, where it still stands.  Together, these churches dominated the town, set against the backdrop of the first ridge of the Appalachians, Catoctin Mountain. The abolitionist poet John Greenleaf Whittier immortalized this view of Frederick in his poem to Barbara Fritchie: "The clustered spires of Frederick stand — greenwalled in the hills of Maryland." Civil WarFrederick's status as a major crossroads put the town at the center of the Maryland campaigns of the Civil War, during which both Union and Confederate troops marched through the city. General Stonewall Jackson led his light infantry division through Frederick on his way to the battles of Crampton's, Fox's and Turner's Gaps on South Mountain and Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland in September 1862.  An incident with Pennsylvania Dutch resident Barbara Fritchie was commemorated in the poem of the same name by John Greenleaf Whittier. Union Major General Jesse L. Reno's IX Corps followed Jackson's men through the city a few days later on the way to the Battle of South Mountain, where Reno was killed. In July 1864, in the third Southern invasion, Confederate troops led by Lieutenant General Jubal Early fought through Frederick towards Washington DC via Monocacy or Frederick Junction.  Union troops under Major General Lew Wallace awaited the Confederate advancement at Monocacy Junction which led to the Battle of Monocacy Junction.  Slaves escaped from Frederick and the area (since Maryland was still a "slave state" although an unseceeded border state) to join the Union forces, work against the Confederacy and seek freedom.Sites of historical interestSeveral historic Civil War landmarks are located in and around Frederick. It was the site of a Civil War succinct speech given by President Abraham Lincoln, on his way to visit Gen. George McClellan after the Battle of Antietam and South Mountain which he gave at what was then the B. & O. Railroad depot at the current intersection of South and South Market Streets. A plaque commemorates the speech at what is today a community Social Services office).At the Prospect Hall mansion off Jefferson Street to Buckeystown Pike near what is now Butterfly Lane, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1863, a messenger from President Abraham Lincoln and General-in-Chief Henry Halleck arrived to inform General George Meade that he would be replacing General Joseph Hooker after the latter's earlier disaster at Chancellorsville in May. The Army of the Potomac, which was camped around the Prospect Hall property for the last several days in pursuit of Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia prior to Gettysburg, went on to fight several major battles. A large granite rectangular monument made from one of the boulders at the "Devil's Den" in Gettysburg to the east along the driveway commemorates the midnight change-of-command.  The National Museum of Civil War Medicine is located downtown on East Patrick Street with many exhibits on the state of medicine and surgery under the extreme war-time strains.Due west along the National Road, now Alternate U.S. Route 40, and west of Burkittsville, lie the sites of three episodes in the Battle of South Mountain: the battles of Crampton's (September 14, 1862), Fox's, and Turner's Gaps, where Confederate troops under Jackson and Walker unsuccessfully attempted to halt the Federal army's westward advance into the Cumberland Valley and towards Sharpsburg in Washington County. The War Correspondents' Memorial stone arch erected by reporter/editor George Alfred Townsend (1841-1914) can be found at Gathland State Park at Crampton's Gap, just west of Burkittsville. The 1889 memorial by Union soldiers of his IX Corps to the slain Major General Jesse L. Reno lies on the south side of the National Road, Alternate U.S. Route 40, west of Middletown, just below the summit of Fox's Gap on Reno Monument Road, along with a more recent Confederate memorial from 1993 to Brig. Gen. Sameul L. Garland, Jr., who was also killed along with a monument (2005), one-half mile south to North Carolina troops who held the line here.The Monocacy National Battlefield of 1864 lies just southeast of the city limits, along the Monocacy River at the B. & O. Railroad junction known as "Frederick Junction" or "Monocacy Junction"  where two bridges cross the stream - an iron-truss bridge for the railroad and a covered wooden bridge for the Frederick-Urbana-Georgetown Pike, which was the site of the main battle of July 1864.  Some skirmishing occurred further north across the Monocacy at the stone-arched "Jug Bridge" for the crossing of the National Road east of Frederick (built 1806) and an artillery bombardment occurred west of town along the National Road near Red Man's Hill where Prospect Hall mansion was sited as the Union troops retreated eastward.  Antietam National Battlefield and South Mountain State Battlefield Park of 1862 and Gettysburg National Battlefield of 1863 lie approximately   to the west and northeast, respectively.The reconstructed home of Barbara Fritchie on West Patrick Street, just past Carroll Creek linear park, who according to legend waved the Stars and Stripes in defiance of Confederate commander Stonewall Jackson and his troops as they marched through downtown Frederick in 1862, stands as another historical site. Though the legend has been generally discredited, it was widely believed during the Civil War and was the subject of an 1864 poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, a poem that remained popular for decades. Barbara Fritchie, a significant figure in Maryland history in her own right, is buried in Frederick's Mount Olivet Cemetery. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill quoted the famous poem to President Franklin D. Roosevelt when they stopped here in 1941 on a car trip to the presidential retreat, then called "Shangra-La" (now "Camp David") in the Catoctin Mountains near Thurmont.All the Civil War sites around Frederick are recently commemorated by illustrated placards on table-style supports of the new "Civil War Trails" system adopted by several eastern states and their tourism agencies including Maryland . These are connected with appropriate brochures and internet websites for further detailed descriptions. (  19th centuryAdmiral Winfield Scott Schley (1839-1911) was born at "Richfields", the mansion home of his father. He became an important naval commander of the American fleet on board his flagship and heavy cruiser U.S.S. Baltimore along with Admiral William T. Sampson in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba off the shores of the Spanish island colony of Cuba in the Spanish-American War in 1898. Major Henry Schley's son, Dr. Fairfax Schley, was instrumental in setting up the Frederick County Agricultural Society and the Great Frederick Fair.  Gilmer Schley served as Mayor from 1919–1922, and the Schleys remained one of the town's leading families into the late twentieth century.  Nathaniel Wilson Schley, a prominent banker, and his wife Mary Margaret Schley helped organize and raise funds for the annual Great Frederick Fair, one of the two largest agricultural fairs in the State. Since the 1960s, the fair has featured many outstanding country-western singers and become a major music festival.  Schley Avenue commemorates the family's role in the city's heritage.In 1872 the Pennsylvania Railroad completed its Frederick Secondary branch line, which ran from Frederick to York, Pennsylvania and Columbia, Pennsylvania. Jewish pioneers Henry Lazarus and Levy Cohan settled in Frederick in the 1740s as merchants. Mostly German Jewish immigrants organized a community in the mid-19th century, creating the  Frederick Hebrew Congregation in 1858. Later the congregation lapsed, but was reorganized in 1917 as a cooperative effort between the older settlers and more recently arrived Eastern European Jews under the name Beth Sholom Congregation.In 1905, Rev. E.B. Hatcher started the First Baptist Church of Frederick.After the Civil War, the Maryland legislature established racially segregated public facilities by the end of the 19th century, re-imposing white supremacy. Black institutions were typically underfunded in the state, and it was not until 1921 that Frederick established a public high school for African Americans. First located at 170 West All Saints Street, it moved to 250 Madison Street, where it eventually was adapted as South Frederick Elementary. The building presently houses the Lincoln Elementary School.Notable housesPossibly the oldest house in the city of Frederick is Schifferstadt, built in 1756 by German settler Joseph Brunner. It is now the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum.In 1814, Dr. John Tyler built what is called the Tyler Spite House at 112 W. Church Street in Frederick to prevent the city from extending Record Street south through Tyler's land to meet West Patrick Street. Williams, N.  "This Maryland House was built just for spite", Los Angeles Times, 29 April 1990  "A Matter of Spite", Frederick News Post GeographyFrederick is located in Frederick County in the north and western part of the state of Maryland. The city has served as a major crossroads since colonial times. Today it is located at the junction of Interstate 70, Interstate 270, U.S. Route 340, U.S. Route 40, U.S. Route 40 Alternate and U.S. Route 15 (which runs north-south). In relation to nearby cities, Frederick lies   west of Baltimore,   north and slightly west of Washington, D.C.,   southeast of Hagerstown, Maryland, and   southwest of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city's coordinates 39°25'35" North, 77°25'13" West (39.426294, -77.420403). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.    The city's area is predominantly land, with small areas of water being the Monocacy River, which runs to the east of the city, Carroll Creek (which runs through the city and causes periodic floods, such as that during the summer of 1972 and fall of 1976), as well as several neighborhood ponds and small city owned lakes, like Culler Lake, a man-made small body in the downtown area. Demographics2010 censusAs of the 2010 U.S. census , there were 65,239 people residing in Frederick city and roughly 27,000 households. The city's population grew by 23.6% in the ten years since the 2000 census, making it the fastest growing incorporated area in the state of Maryland with a population of over 50,000 for 2010. 2010 census data put the racial makeup of the city at 61% White, 18.6% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 5.8% Asian American, and 14.4% Hispanic or Latino of any race. Roughly 4% of the city’s population was of two or more races.In regard to minority group growth, the 2010 census data show the city's Hispanic population at 9,402, a 271 percent increase compared with 2,533 in 2000, making Hispanics/Latinos the fastest growing race group in the city and in Frederick county (267 percent increase). Frederick city had 3,800 Asian residents in 2010, a 128 percent increase from the city's 1,664 Asian residents in 2000. The city's black or African-American population increased 56 percent, from 7,777 in 2000 to 12,144 in 2010. For the roughly 27,000 households in the city, 30.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.7% were married couples living together, 12.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41% were non-families. Approximately 31% of all households were made up of individuals living alone and 8.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.11.2009 American Community SurveyAs of 2009, 27.5% of the city’s population was under the age of 19, 24.5% were between 20 and 34, 28.1% were between 35 and 54, 9.0% were between 55 and 64, and 10.5% were 65 years of age or older. The median age of a Frederick city resident for 2009 was 34 years. For adults aged 18 or older, the population was 48.6% male and 51.4% female. According to U.S. census data for 2009, the median annual income for a household in Frederick city was $64,833, and the median annual income for a family was $77,642. Males had a median annual income of $49,129 versus $41,986 for females. The per capita income for the city was $31,123. Approximately 7.7% of the total population, 5.3% of families, and 5.2% of adults aged 65 and older were living below the poverty line. The unemployment rate in the city for adults over the age of 18 was 5.1%.In regard to educational attainment for individuals aged 25 or older as of 2009, 34% of the city's residents had a bachelor's or advanced professional degree, 29.6% had some college or an associate's degree, 21.6% had a high school diploma or equivalency, 6.8% had between a 9th and 12th grade level of education, and 3.6% had an 8th grade or lower level of education.The median value of a home in Frederick city as of 2009 was $303,900, with the bulk of owner-occupied homes valued at between $300,000 and $500,000. The median cost of a rental unit was $1,054 per month, with the bulk of rental units priced between $1,000 and $1,500 per month. The value of the housing stock in Frederick is above the national average and significantly higher than small nearby cities such as Hagerstown, MD and Harrisburg, PA.   This discrepancy likely reflects Frederick’s location as a desirable and growing commuter suburb of Washington, DC (and related areas in Montgomery County MD such as Bethesda), one of the most expensive housing and rental markets in the nation.  2009 census data indicated that roughly 89% of the workforce commuted to work by automobile, with an average commute time of approximately 30 minutes.   This suggests that a substantial portion of those residing in Frederick city are, in fact, commuting out of the county for work.

More recently, its economy has been influenced by it being a center for cancer research, as evidenced by the presence of Fort Detrick, its main employer. Its economy is also strongly influenced by several other industries, including education, government, health care, mortgage and insurance, banking, science and engineering, tourism, transportation, retail, and construction. Frederick is the home of Riverside Research Park, a large biomedical research park being developed on Frederick's east side. Current tenants include relocated offices of the National Cancer Institute (Fort Detrick) as well as Charles River Labs. As a result of continued and enhanced Federal Government investment, the Frederick area will likely maintain a continued growth pattern over the next decade.   Frederick has also been impacted by recent national trends centered on the gentrification of the downtown areas of cities across the nation (particularly in the northeast and mid-Atlantic), and to re-brand them as sites for cultural consumption.Frederick's historic downtown houses more than 200 retailers, restaurants and antique shops along Market, Patrick and East streets.    Restaurants feature a diverse array of cuisines, including Italian American, Thai, Vietnamese, and Ethiopian, as well as a number of regionally recognized dining establishments, such as Volt and The Tasting Room. Outside of the downtown area are garden variety chain dining establishments that comprise a typical suburban landscape (Famous Dave's BBQ; The Olive Garden; Red Lobster; Denny's; etc.) as well as several independently owned restaurants.In addition to retail and dining, downtown Frederick is home to 600 businesses and organizations totaling nearly 5,000 employees. A growing technology sector can be found in downtown’s historic renovated spaces, as well as in new office buildings located along Carroll Creek Park. Carroll Creek Park began as a flood control project in the late 1970s.  It was an effort to reduce the risk to downtown Frederick from the 100-year floodplain and restore economic vitality to the historic commercial district. Today, more than $150 million in private investing is underway or planned in new construction, infill development or historic renovation in the park area. The first phase of the Park improvements, totaling nearly $11 million in construction, run from Court Street to just past Carroll Street.  New elements to the Park include brick pedestrian paths, water features, planters with shade trees and plantings, pedestrian bridges and a 350-seat amphitheater for outdoor performances.A recreational and cultural resource, Carroll Creek Park also serves as an economic development catalyst, with private investment along the creek functioning as a key component to the park’s success. More than 400,000 sf of office space; 150,000 sf of commercial/retail space; nearly 300 residential units; and more than 2,000 parking spaces are planned or under construction.Completed projects include:(1) Creekside Plaza, a 90,000 sf office/commercial/residential building on the northeast corner of Court Street along Carroll Creek. This building is home to The Green Turtle and Wells Fargo Bank on the first floor, three floors of office space which is home to Warner Construction, R&J Builders, America East Mortgage, United Title Services, LLC. and, Real Estate Teams. The top two floors house 11 residential condominiums.(2) The new South Market Center, on the north side of the creek between Market Street and Carroll Street. The 3-story, 43,000+ sf building offers 2 floors of office condominiums and ground floor retail and restaurant space offering outside patio seating. Office tenants occupy the upper two floors and Ben & Jerry’s, Five Guys Hamburgers, Hinode Japanese Restaurant are on the ground floor.On the first Saturday of every month, Frederick hosts an evening event in the downtown area called "First Saturday." Each Saturday has a theme, and activities are planned around those themes in the downtown area (particularly around the Carroll Creek Promenade). The event spans a 10-block area of Frederick and takes place from 5-9 PM. During the late spring, summer, and early fall months, this event draws particularly large crowds from neighboring cities and towns in Maryland, and nearby locations in the tri-state area (Virginia and Pennsylvania). The average number of attendees visiting downtown Frederick during first Saturday events is around 11,000, with higher numbers from May to October. CultureCityscapeFrederick is well known for the "clustered spires" skyline of its historic downtown churches. These spires are depicted on the city's seal and many other city-affiliated logos and insignia.The housing stock of downtown Frederick is mostly composed of 19th and 20th-century row housing and duplexes.  The scale of this older part of the city is dense, with streets and sidewalks suitable for pedestrians, and a variety of shops and restaurants, comprising what Forbes magazine in 2010 called one of the United States' "Greatest Neighborhoods".  Adjacent to downtown are many older communities composed of larger, detached housing built mostly in the early 20th century.  Beyond that is housing from the mid-20th century and beyond, becoming suburban in character the further one travels out. The most extensive growth is to the south of the downtown area, including the business corridor along Maryland highway 85 (Buckeystown Pike) outside the city.Frederick has a bridge painted with a mural titled Community Bridge.  The artist William Cochran has been acclaimed for the trompe l'oeil realism of the mural.  Thousands of people sent ideas representing "community", which he painted on the stonework of the bridge. The residents of Frederick call it "the mural", "painted bridge", or more commonly, the "mural bridge". ArtsThe Frederick Arts Council is the designated arts organization for Frederick County.

In Frederick City proper, Lutheran, Evangelical (German) Reformed, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic (East Second Street), Methodist (West Second Street), Episcopal Church (United States) and United Church of Christ (Congregationalist) churches predominate.  Mount Olivet Cemetery  is the largest  cemetery in the City and is Roman Catholic. Maryland was originally founded as a Catholic colony by Cecil Calvert, a Roman Catholic supporter of England's King Charles I. Frederick County also retains ties to the Pennsylvania Dutch and some Old Order Amish cultivate land as small-scale truck farmers.

Anne Arundel County, Maryland Anne Arundel County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. It is named for Anne Arundell (1615–49), a member of the ancient family of Arundells in Cornwall, England and the wife of Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. Its county seat is Annapolis, which is also the capital of the state. In 2010, its population was 537,656, Odenton Patch Odenton's Population Jumps 17K According to Census. by Tim Lemke, "The western portion of Anne Arundel County saw significant growth, paced by a more than 80 percent jump in residents in Odenton", February 16, 2011, accessed February 17, 2012.  a population increase of just under 10% since 2000.  Anne Arundel County forms part of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Anne Arundel County and Howard County, in the unincorporated town of Jessup. History The County was named for Anne Arundell, the daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, members of the ancient family of Arundells in Cornwall, England.  She married Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore in 1627 or 1628.Anne Arundel County was originally part of St. Mary's County in the Province of Maryland.  In 1650, the year after Anne Arundell's death, the county separated and became the 3rd of 23 Maryland counties.  Between 1654 and 1658, the county was known as "Providence County" by many of its early Puritan settlers.  On March 25, 1655, during the English Civil War, the Battle of the Severn was fought in Anne Arundel County between Puritan forces supporting the Commonwealth of England and forces loyal to Cæcilius Calvert.  The Commonwealth forces under William Fuller were victorious.Between 1694 and 1695, the capital of Maryland was moved from St. Mary's City in St. Mary's County to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County.  Prior to the move, Annapolis was known as "Providence". During the American Revolutionary War, citizens of Anne Arundel County supported the Continental Army by providing troops for three regiments.  The 3rd Maryland Regiment, the 4th Maryland Regiment, and the 6th Maryland Regiment recruited in the county. During the War of 1812, the USS Constitution sailed from Annapolis prior to its victorious engagement with the HMS Guerriere. On May 22, 1830, the inaugural horse-drawn train of the B & O Railroad travelled the   of the newly-completed track from Mount Clare Station in Baltimore City to Ellicott Mills in Anne Arundel County.  This was the first regular railroad passenger service in the United States.  In 1831, Land West of the railroad was considered the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. In 1851, The Howard district was broken off to form Howard County, the 21st county in Maryland. The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.   GeographyPhysical Geography and GeologyAnne Arundel County is located to the south of the city of Baltimore. According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 70.75%) is land and   (or 29.25%) is water.  Most of the county's borders are defined by water. To the east lies Chesapeake Bay, and numerous tidal tributaries of the bay indent the shoreline, forming prominent peninsulas. The largest of these tributaries include (from north to south) the Magothy River, Severn River, South River, and West River. The Patuxent River forms the border with Prince George's County to the west. Deep Run forms part of the northwestern border with Howard County, and Lyons Creek forms part of the southern border with Calvert County. The Patapsco River to the north is the border with Baltimore County, but the Brooklyn and Curtis Bay neighborhoods lying south of the Patapsco were annexed from Anne Arundel County to Baltimore City in 1918.  Anne Arundel County originally included all of the land between the Patuxent River and the Patapsco River (mainstem and South Branch) upstream to their headwaters on Parr's Ridge. The northwestern section of this long tract later became Howard County, with the border between the two running very close to the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. As a result Anne Arundel County lies almost entirely within the Atlantic Coastal Plain while Howard County is almost entirely within the Piedmont province. Elevations in Anne Arundel County range from sea level at the Chesapeake and tidal tributaries to approximately   in western areas near the fall line.  The terrain is mostly flat or gently rolling, but more dramatic banks and bluffs can be found where waterways cut through areas of higher elevation.With the exception of the very limited extent of Piedmont underlain by Precambrian to early Paleozoic metamorphic rock, all of the county is underlain by thick deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and clay dating from the early Cretaceous to Holocene times.   Most of these sediments are unconsolidated but include local formations of sandstone, especially in the Pasadena area.

Annual precipitation averages around   per year throughout the county, with a fairly even distribution throughout the year. Annual snowfall totals around   on average at BWI Airport, which has an elevation of   above sea level. Slightly colder winter temperatures and higher snowfall are experienced at the higher elevations, with slightly lower snowfall closer to sea level.  According to the most recent USDA Hardiness zone maps, the lowland areas of the county fall into Zone 7b, with possible winter minimum temperatures of 5 to 10 °F (−15 to −12 °C), while higher areas fall into Zone 7a, with possible winter minimums of 0 to 5 °F (−18 to −15 °C).

Kensington, Maryland  Kensington is a town in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,213 at the 2010 census.  Greater Kensington encompasses the entire 20895 zip code and its population is an order of magnitude larger than that of the town at its center.HistoryThe area around the Rock Creek basin where Kensington is located was primarily agricultural until 1873, when the B&O Railroad completed the Metropolitan Branch which traversed Montgomery County.  A community arose where the new railroad line intersected the old Rockville-to-Bladensburg road.  This early settlement was first known as Knowles Station.  In the early 1890s, Washington, D.C. developer Brainard Warner began purchasing land parcels to build a planned Victorian community, complete with church, library, and a local newspaper.  Fascinated by a recent trip to London, Warner first named his town Kensington Park.  Upon incorporation in 1894, the town was renamed Kensington.  The historic core of Kensington was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as the Kensington Historic District in 1980.   Initially Kensington was a summer refuge for Washington, D.C., residents wishing to escape the capital's humid summers.  As years passed and its residents increasingly remained year round, Kensington evolved into a commuter suburb.  The large southernmost section originally mapped out by Warner remains largely unchanged since inception, and is a historically preserved zone.  Indeed the only major changes in the town's basic layout have been the bridging over of the original railroad crossing in 1937, and the extension and widening of Connecticut Avenue, the town's main thoroughfare, in 1957.The little town gained national attention three times in a 10-month span early in the 21st century as a result of events which occurred within a mere quarter-mile radius.  In December 2001, the town responded to complaints from anonymous citizens by banning Santa Claus from the annual holiday parade.  Protesters arrived at the parade en masse, including hundreds of Santas riding everything from motorcycles to fire trucks.  Eight months later, an Amtrak train derailed adjacent to the town center when the tracks separated at an overheated joint, sending over a hundred victims to area hospitals.  Fortunately, there were no fatalities.  Then, on October 2, 2002, Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera became the fifth victim of the snipers who terrorized the Washington area that month, while cleaning her auto at a Kensington gas station. (See Beltway sniper attacks.)GeographyKensington is located in Montgomery County, northwest of Silver Spring, northeast of Bethesda, southwest of Wheaton, and southeast of Rockville. Its latitude is 39°1′48″N, longitude 77°4′30″W.According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of  , all of it land.   While the town proper is but one-half square mile in size, the Kensington Post Office services a much larger area and extends into North Bethesda, MD and the Wheaton Planning District.   Residents within this ZIP code (20895) generally refer to Kensington as their home town even though they technically do not reside in Kensington.Significant through roads in Kensington include Maryland Routes 185 (Connecticut Avenue), 193 (University Boulevard West), and 547 (Knowles Avenue).The look and white color of the Washington D.C. Temple located in Kensignton, coupled with its location near the Capital Beltway has made it a local landmark.  D.C.-area traffic reports often refer to the "Mormon temple" or "temple".

Three New Urbanism communities are under construction, including Crown Farm, Watkins Mill Town Center (Casey East and West), and the massive "Science City".  The state has a light rail line, Corridor Cities Transitway or "CCT", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.  Other major employers in the city include IBM, Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, MedImmune (recently purchased by AstraZeneca), and the French multinational corporation, Sodexo.Gaithersburg is also the location of the garrison of the United States Army Reserve's 220th Military Police Brigade.EtymologyPronunciation  The Wikipedia page on Pronunciation of English th lists "Gaithersburg" among the many words and proper names of English origin in which non-initial TH is soft, as in "bathe" and "whether." However, Merriam-Webster.com shows a hard th, as in "thing" and "both." Since Benjamin Gaither lived during the 18th century, it's probable that his name was pronounced with a soft TH as in most native English names and words in which it occurs in the middle, and this would have been carried over into the city name. However, as the population of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area mushroomed after World War II, and especially after the construction of the Washington Beltway and the D.C. Metro lured affluent government employees and other professionals into the suburbs, the population of Gaithersburg swelled and the influence of the original settlers has waned. Pronunciation has shifted to a hard TH, consistent with the consonant's pronunciation in the multitude of words of Greek origin assimilated into English by scholars during the Enlightenment and invented by scientists and engineers during the scientific and technological boom of the 20th century.HistoryGaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small agricultural settlement known as Log Town    near the present day Summitee Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant "Deer Park". The northern portion of the land grant was purchased by Henry Brookes, and he built his home Montpelier there in the late 1780s or early 1790s. His son-in-law, Benjamin Gaither, inherited a portion of that land. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802.  By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called log town and was known to inhabitants as Gaitherburg.   The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851. However, when the railroad was built through town the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time. The town incorporated under its current name in 1878. Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, grain elevators, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station. In 1873 the B&O Railroad constructed a station at Gaithersburg,  designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin as part of his well-known series of Victorian stations in Maryland.  Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878 the town was officially incorporated as the City of Gaithersburg.In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an International Latitude Observatory as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis. The Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory is (as of 2007) the only National Historic Landmark in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in Japan, Italy, Russia, and the United States gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from satellites, to determine polar motion; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the last 1990s and 2000s, it has become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area as well as the state of Maryland, with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with Gaithersburg High School and Watkins Mill High School having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.During a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down.    The tree served as the inspiration for the city's logo, which is also featured prominent on the city's flag. On July 16, 2010, Gaithersburg was hit by a 3.6 magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest to occur in Maryland.GeographyGaithersburg is located at 39°7'55" North, 77°13'35" West (39.131974, -77.226428) .According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.

Annapolis, Maryland    Annapolis is the capital of the U.S. state of Maryland, as well as the county seat of Anne Arundel County. It had a population of 38,394 at the 2010 census and is situated on the Chesapeake Bay at the mouth of the Severn River,   south of Baltimore and about   east of Washington, D.C.  Annapolis is part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The city was the temporary capital of the United States in 1783–1784 and the site of the Annapolis Peace Conference, held in November 2007, at the United States Naval Academy.  Annapolis is the home of St. John's College.HistoryColonial and early United States (1649–1808)A settlement in the Province of Maryland named Providence was founded on the north shore of the Severn River in 1649 by Puritan exiles from Virginia led by Governor William Stone. The settlers later moved to a better-protected harbor on the south shore. The settlement on the south shore was initially named "Town at Proctor's," then "Town at the Severn," and later "Anne Arundel's Towne" (after the wife of Lord Baltimore who died soon afterwards). The city became very wealthy through the slave trade.In 1654, after the Third English Civil War, Parliamentary forces assumed control of Maryland and Stone went into exile in Virginia. Per orders from Lord Baltimore, Stone returned the following spring at the head of a Cavalier force.  On March 25, 1655, in what is known as the Battle of the Severn, Stone was defeated, taken prisoner, and replaced by Josias Fendall as Governor. Fendall governed Maryland during the latter half of the Commonwealth. In 1660, he was replaced by Phillip Calvert after the restoration of Charles II as King in England.In 1694, soon after the overthrow of the Catholic government of Thomas Lawrence, Francis Nicholson moved the capital of the royal colony to Anne Arundel's Towne and renamed the town Annapolis after Princess Anne of Denmark and Norway, soon to be the Queen of Great Britain. Annapolis was incorporated as a city in 1708. From the middle of the 18th century until the American Revolutionary War, Annapolis was noted for its wealthy and cultivated society. The Maryland Gazette, which became an important weekly journal, was founded there by Jonas Green   in 1745; in 1769 a theatre was opened; during this period also the commerce was considerable, but declined rapidly after Baltimore, with its deeper harbor, was made a port of entry in 1780. Water trades such as oyster-packing, boatbuilding and sailmaking became the city's chief industries. Currently, Annapolis is home to a large number of recreational boats that have largely replaced the seafood industry in the city.Annapolis became the temporary capital of the United States after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Congress was in session in the state house from November 26, 1783 to June 3, 1784, and it was in Annapolis on December 23, 1783, that General Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army.For the 1783 Congress, the Governor of Maryland commissioned John Shaw, a local cabinet maker, to create an American flag.  The flag is slightly different from other designs of the time. The blue field extends over the entire height of the hoist. Shaw created two versions of the flag: one which started with a red stripe and another that started with a white one.In 1786, a convention, to which delegates from all the states of the Union were invited, was called to meet in Annapolis to consider measures for the better regulation of commerce; but delegates came from only five states (New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, and Delaware), and the convention, known afterward as the "Annapolis Convention", without proceeding to the business for which it had met, passed a resolution calling for another convention to meet at Philadelphia in the following year to amend the Articles of Confederation. The Philadelphia convention drafted and approved the Constitution of the United States, which is still in force.Civil War era (1849–late 1800s)During this period, a prisoner of war Camp Parole was set up in Annapolis. As the war continued, the camp expanded to a larger location just west of  the city. The area is still referred to as Parole. Wounded Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners were brought by sea to a major hospital in Annapolis.The first Filipino immigrated to Annapolis after the Spanish-American War when Filipinos served at the United States Naval Academy.  These Filipino immigrants dealt with institutional racism.  These immigrants later established the Filipino-American Friendly Association. Contemporary (1900s–present)In 1900, Annapolis had a population of 8,585. To the north of the state house is a monument to Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice of the US Supreme Court and formerly a Maryland lawyer who won many important civil rights cases.Close by are the state treasury building, erected late in the 17th century for the House of Delegates; Saint Anne's Protestant Episcopal church, in later colonial days a state church, a statue of Roger B. Taney (by W.H. Rinehart), and a statue of Baron Johann de Kalb.Annapolis has many 18th century houses. The names of several of the streets—King George's, Prince George's, Hanover, and Duke of Gloucester, etc.—date from colonial days. The United States Naval Academy was founded here in 1845.  During World War II, shipyards in Annapolis built a number of PT Boats, and military vessels such as minesweepers and patrol boats were built in Annapolis during the Korean and Vietnam war. In the summer of 1984, The Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis hosted soccer games as part of the XXIII Olympiad.During September 18–19, 2003, Hurricane Isabel created the largest storm surge known in Annapolis's history, cresting at  7.58 feet (2.31 m) . Much of downtown Annapolis was flooded and many businesses and homes in outlying areas were damaged.  The previous record was   during a hurricane in 1933, and  5.5 feet (1.68 m)  during Hurricane Hazel in 1954.Currently facing the many difficult challenges of American cities today, Annapolis is undergoing rapid low-density development along its edges, ever-increasing traffic congestion, as well as ecological destruction of the very bay that it depends upon. The 1998 Comprehensive Plan will soon be replaced with a new document, containing initiatives and directives of the city government on development and infrastructure. This process was mandated by Maryland state law in the Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Act of 1992. Annapolis Charter 300 and EnVISIONing Annapolis co-sponsored a public lecture series from September 2007 through June 2008 exploring these issues.From mid-2007 through December 2008, the city celebrated the 300th Anniversary of its 1708 Royal Charter, which established democratic self-governance. The many cultural events of this celebration were organized by Annapolis Charter 300.Notable institutionsThe State HouseThe Maryland State House is the oldest in continuous legislative use in the United States. Construction started in 1772, and the Maryland legislature first met there in 1779. It is topped by the largest wooden dome built without nails in the country.   The Maryland State House housed the workings of the United States government from November 26, 1783 to August 13, 1784, and the Treaty of Paris was ratified there on January 14, 1784, so Annapolis became the first peacetime capital of the US.It was in the Maryland State House that George Washington famously resigned his commission before the Continental Congress on December 23, 1783.United States Naval AcademyThe United States Naval Academy was founded in 1845 on the site of Fort Severn, and now occupies an area of land reclaimed from the Severn River next to the Chesapeake Bay.St. John's CollegeAnnapolis is the seat of St. John's College, a non-sectarian private college that was once supported by the state; it was opened in 1789 as the successor of King William's School, which was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1696 and was opened in 1701. Its principal building, McDowell Hall, was originally to be the governor's mansion; although £4,000 was appropriated to build it in 1742, it was not completed until after the War of Independence.Theater   Annapolis has a thriving community theater scene which includes two venues in the historic district. On East St. is Colonial Players, a company that produces approximately six shows a year on its small theater-in-the-round stage. From 1981 through 2008, Colonial Players  produced a musical version of A Christmas Carol, which they commissioned. Feeling that the production had become stale, the holiday show was replaced with another play in 2009. Public reaction was unfavorable, and A Christmas Carol returned in December 2010. During the warmer months, Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre presents three shows on its stage, which is visible from the City Dock. All shows put on by King Williams Players, the student theater group at St. John's College, are free and open to the public. Annapolis is also host to The Bay Theater Company, a non-profit professional drama group. The Naval Academy Masqueraders put on several productions annually in Mahan Hall.Museums, historical sites, and monumentsThe Banneker-Douglass Museum, located in the historic Mount Moriah Church at 87 Franklin Street, documents the history of African Americans in Maryland.

It was named for Edward Preble.The Hammond-Harwood House is originally belonged to Matthias Hammond, and has now been restored. Tours are now offered.The Kunta Kinte- Alex Haley memorial is located in downtown Annapolis, on the harbor. It commemorates the place of arrival of Alex Haley's African ancestor, Kunta Kinte. The story of Kunta Kinte is related in Haley's book Roots.The Paca House and Garden encompasses an 18th-century Georgian mansion constructed by William Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The property includes a terraced garden that has been restored to its colonial-era design.A number of structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.   OtherThe Annapolis area was the home of a VLF-transmitter called NSS Annapolis,that was used by the United States Navy to communicate with its Atlantic submarine fleet.  Annapolis often serves as the end point for the 3,000 mile annual transcontinental Race Across America bicycle race.Middle East Peace Conference As announced by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Annapolis was the venue for a Middle East summit, with the participation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ("Abu Mazen") and various other leaders from the region.

From 1840 to 1968, Annapolis was connected to the outside world by the railroads. The Washington, Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad (WB&A) operated two electrified interurban lines that brought passengers into the city from both the South and the North. The southern route ran down King George Street and Main Street, leading directly to the statehouse, while the northern route entered town via Glen Burnie. In 1935, the WB&A went bankrupt due to the effects of the Great Depression and suspended service along its southern route, while the newly created Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad (B&A) retained service on the northern route. Steam trains of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also occasionally operated over the line to Annapolis, primarily for special Naval Academy movements. Passenger rail service on the B&A was eventually discontinued in 1950; freight service ceased in 1968 after the dilapidated trestle crossing the Severn River was condemned. The tracks were eventually dismantled in 1976. The popular Baltimore & Annapolis Trail now occupies the former railway line between the Severn River and Glen Burnie.

Its county seat is Westminster.Carroll County is a part of the Baltimore metropolitan area and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. While predominantly rural, the county has become increasingly suburban in recent years.HistoryCarroll County was created in 1837  from parts of Baltimore and Frederick Counties, see Hundred (division). It was named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), signer of the American Declaration of Independence. During the American Civil War, the population of Carroll County was sharply divided between supporters of the Union and the Confederacy.   In 1863, there were significant troop movements through the county as part of the Gettysburg campaign. On June 29, 1863, the cavalry skirmish known as Corbit's Charge was fought in the streets of Westminster, when two companies of Delaware cavalry attacked a much larger Confederate force under General J.E.B. Stuart.In 2013 the Carroll County Board of Commissioners voted to make English the official language of the county. GeographyTopographically, Carroll County is located within the Piedmont Plateau region, with characteristic upland terrain of rolling hills and deciduous forest. The most prominent relief is Parr's Ridge, which bisects the county from southwest to northeast. The highest point is in the northeastern part of the county on Dug Hill along Deep Run Road.Carroll County is bordered on the north by the Mason-Dixon Line with Pennsylvania, and on the south by Howard County across the South Branch of the Patapsco River.  About half of the eastern border, with Baltimore County, is formed by the North Branch of the Patapsco River and by Liberty Reservoir, though the northern half near Manchester and Hampstead is a land border.  Carroll County is bordered on the west by Frederick County, across the Monocacy River and Sam's Creek. Other major streams in the county include Big Pipe Creek, Little Pipe Creek, and Double Pipe Creek, Bear Branch, and the headwaters of the Gunpowder Falls. The Piney Run Reservoir is in the southern part of the county.Three railroad lines cross Carroll County. The old Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) Old Main Line crosses the southern part of the county from east to west, with former stations in Sykesville and Mount Airy. The original Western Maryland Railway (WM) main line track runs southeast to northwest through Carrollton, Westminster, New Windsor, and Union Bridge. The old Baltimore and Hanover Railroad (later acquired by WM) runs further to the east through Hampstead, Millers, and Lineboro. Two of these railroad lines are now operated by CSX Transportation; the former WM main line is now operated by Maryland Midland Railway.According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 99.28%) is land and   (or 0.72%) is water.

A. Bank Clothiers has its headquarters in an unincorporated area in the county, near Hampstead.  Arts and cultureMuseums and other points of interestThe county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.   GovernmentCarroll County is governed by five county commissioners, a "commission" being the traditional form of county government in Maryland.Several times in the past, Carroll County voters have rejected charter amendments that would call for a government consisting of a County Executive and a County Council.Carroll County differs from most counties in the Baltimore-Washington area in that it is strongly Republican.CommissionersIn 2004 Carroll County voters approved legislation that will expand the number of County Commissioners from three to five. The five Commissioners will be elected from five Commissioner districts, as opposed to three Commissioners elected at-large. The change occurred with the 2010 elections, since the Maryland General Assembly did not agree on the districts in time for the 2006 elections.Commissioners elected in 2010—all Republican   —were:Robin Frazier, Commissioner, District 1, (also served 1998-2002)   Haven Shoemaker, Commissioner, District 2   Dave Roush, Commissioner, District 3   Richard Rothschild, Commissioner, District 4   Doug Howard, Commissioner, District 5   CabinetSupporting the commissioners is a cabinet, composed of the following departments:   Administrative ServicesCitizen Services (Jolene G. Sullivan, Director)Comptroller (Rob Burk, Comptroller)County Attorney (Timothy C. Burke, County Attorney)Economic Development (Lawrence F. Twele, Director)Land Use, Planning, and Development (Thomas S. Devilbiss, Acting Director)Management and Budget (Ted Zaleski, Director)Public Works (Thomas J. Rio, Director)SheriffThe current elected Sheriff is Kenneth L. Tregoning.   EducationThe Carroll County Public Schools School system is the ninth largest school district in the state of Maryland.MediaThe newspaper of record is the Carroll County Times.InfrastructureMajor Highways State Route 26 State Route 27 State Route 32 State Route 91 State Route 97 State Route 140 State Route 194Law EnforcementLaw enforcement services for the county are provided by the Carroll County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police, as well as several municipalities having their own police forces.  In addition to providing police services, the Sheriff's Office also acts as an agent of the courts:  serving warrants, enforcing child support laws, ensuring courthouse security, transporting prisoners, etc.  On October 4, 2007, the County Commissioners voted to create a police department for the county. The police department would handle primary law enforcement duties while the Sheriff's office would continue to act under the arm of the courts. This move would give the Commissioners power to appoint or fire the chief of police instead of having a popularly elected Sheriff being in charge of all law enforcement.  This move falls in line with Maryland's more populated counties who have such a dual system of law enforcement (Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Prince George's, Howard and Baltimore Counties), as Carroll County has begun to have a population increase.  Municipal departments, such as Westminster Police, would be unaffected by the change.  Support ServicesGeneral counseling, trauma-based therapy, support for victims of domestic violence, in-home aide for the adult disabled, and other assistance to Carroll County families and individuals are offered by Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland (FCS),   a private nonprofit organization with offices in Westminster, Maryland.   FCS also operates an adult day care center in Westminster.   Some services are offered without charge; others are offered on a sliding-fee scale based on income.==Notable people== Francis Scott Key, author of the Star Spangled Banner, was born at his family plantation of Terra Rubra, in what is now northwestern Carroll County.

Worcester County, Maryland Worcester County ( ) is the easternmost county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. The county includes the entire length of the state's Atlantic coast.  It is home to the popular vacation resort area of Ocean City, as well as wild habitats on Assateague Island and in the Pocomoke Swamp.  The county was named for an Earl of Worcester. Its county seat is Snow Hill.  It is included in the Ocean Pines, Maryland, Micropolitan Statistical Area.  The population was 51,454 at the 2010 census. HistoryWorcester County was created by the division of Somerset County in 1742.  The county seat, previously located near the confluence of Dividing Creek with the Pocomoke River, was transferred to the river port of Snow Hill, at the head of navigation of the Pocomoke, near the center of the new county.Both Somerset and Worcester Counties were early on divided into hundreds, from south to north: Mattapony, Pocomoke, Boquetenorton, Wicomico, and Baltimore Hundreds.  Later subdivisions of the hundreds added Pitts Creek, Acquango, Queponco, and Buckingham & Worcester Hundreds, all of which in turn became election districts following American independence. Competing territorial claims between the Calverts of Maryland and the Penns of Pennsylvania and of what later became the state of Delaware led to the surveying of Worcester County's northern border, the Transpeninsular Line in 1751, though boundary disputes continued through the rest of the colonial period. In 1779, Stephen Decatur, hero of the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War, was born at Sinepuxent, near what is today the town of Berlin.  Originally settled almost entirely by immigrants of British and Irish stock, Worcester County was divided during the colonial period into several parishes, though Quakers, Presbyterians, and later Methodists also set up meeting houses. Like the border states in general, Worcester County had a high proportion of free people of color for many decades before the Civil War, due in part to the influence of initially Quakerism, and later Methodism.  Worcester County was primarily an agricultural area from its inception, first planting tobacco, but when the quality produced in the area's sandy soil could not compete with that produced elsewhere, growing wheat, corn, and livestock. Early industrial activity included the smelting of bog iron ore in a brick blast furnace to make pig iron at Furnacetown in the first half of the 19th century. The presence of large bald cypress swamps along the Pocomoke River led to logging, the manufacture of roofing shingles, and shipbuilding along the river at Newtown (later Pocomoke City). The arrival of steam-powered water transport and then the railroad opened urban markets to another of Worcester County's principal products: seafood, particularly shellfish. Oysters, clams, and crabs were shipped to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Soon after the Civil War (to each side of which Worcester County sent soldiers), parts of both Worcester and Somerset Counties were combined to create, in 1867, Wicomico County. Also in the later 19th century, the seaside resort of Ocean City was founded.Truck farming and the canning industry came to the fore during the early 20th century. However, both the seafood industry and truck farming declined after mid-century, due to overfishing on the one hand, and the opening of California's Central Valley to irrigated agriculture on the other, but the advent of the large-scale poultry industry filled this gap. The expansion of Ocean City since the 1960s has turned the northern part of the county from a summer resort to an expanding year-round community.Two major storms influenced the course of Worcester County history in the 20th century: the hurricane of 1933, which badly damaged Ocean City and Public Landing, but also cut the Ocean City Inlet, and the nor'easter of 1962, which destroyed much of the residential development on Assateague Island and led to the creation of the National Seashore.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.   Law and governmentWorcester County was granted home rule in 1976 under a state code. There is a circuit court located in Snow Hill and two district courts.EducationThe following institutions are part of the Worcester County public school system, governed by the Worcester County Board of Education:Showell Elementary SchoolBuckingham Elementary SchoolOcean City Elementary SchoolSnow Hill Elementary SchoolPocomoke Elementary SchoolBerlin Intermediate SchoolStephen Decatur Middle SchoolSnow Hill Middle SchoolPocomoke Middle SchoolStephen Decatur High SchoolSnow Hill High SchoolPocomoke High SchoolWorcester Technical High SchoolCedar Chapel Special SchoolIn the fall of 2008 Worcester County has plans to open Worcester Technical High School to all residents of the county, to replace Worcester Career and Technology Center.The following private schools also operate in Worcester County:Worcester Preparatory SchoolSeaside Christian AcademyMost Blessed Sacrament Catholic SchoolSnow Hill Mennonite SchoolThe Tidewater School by the SeaGeographyAccording to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 68.12%) is land and   (or 31.88%) is water. The terrain is mostly level and coastal. The lowest elevation is sea level along the Atlantic Ocean and the highest elevation is   in the northwestern part of the county along State Route 12 just south of the Wicomico County line.National protected areaAssateague Island National Seashore (part)Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge (part)TransportationMajor U.S. highways in Worcester County include U.S. Route 50, whose east end is in Ocean City. US 50 serves as one of the main access points to Ocean City, also surrounded by a vast amount of commercial development. U.S. Route 13 is the main north–south route of the Delmarva Peninsula, providing access to Pocomoke City. U.S. Route 113 is the main north–south artery of Worcester County, and is well-known locally for its dangerous two-lane sections which are currently being addressed. US 113 also possesses a business route through Snow Hill. Major state highways include Maryland Route 90, which is a freeway from US 50 to northern Ocean City, and Maryland Route 12, which connects Snow Hill and Salisbury.Freight trains run into Delaware from Snow Hill on the Worcester Railroad, and the main line (formerly Pennsylvania Railroad) from Philadelphia to Cape Charles, Virginia and Norfolk runs through the southeastern corner of the county. A small airport is located near Ocean City, but has no scheduled service.Adjacent countiesAccomack County, Virginia (south)Somerset County (west)Sussex County, Delaware (north)Wicomico County (northwest)Demographics 2010Whereas according to the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau:82.0% White13.6% Black0.3% Native American1.1% Asian0.0% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander1.7% Two or more races1.3% Other races3.2% Hispanic or Latino (of any race)2000As of the census  of 2000, there were 46,543 people, 19,694 households, and 13,273 families residing in the county.

List of counties in Maryland There are twenty-four counties and county-equivalents in the U.S. state of Maryland. Though an independent city rather than a county, the City of Baltimore is considered the equal of a county for most purposes and is a county-equivalent. Many of the counties in Maryland were named for relatives of the Barons Baltimore who were the proprietors of the Maryland colony from its founding in 1634 through 1771. The Barons Baltimore were Catholic, and George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, originally intended that the colony be a haven for English Catholics, though for most of its history Maryland has had a majority of Protestants. The last new county formation in Maryland occurred when Garrett County was formed in 1872 from portions of Allegany County.    However, there have been numerous border changes since that time, most recently when portions of the city of Takoma Park that had previously been part of Prince George's County were absorbed into Montgomery County in 1997. Outside of Baltimore (which is an independent city) the county is the default unit of local government. Under Maryland law, counties exercise powers reserved in most other states at the municipal or state levels, so there is little incentive for a community to incorporate. Many of the state's most populous and economically important communities, such as Bethesda, Silver Spring, Columbia, and Towson are unincorporated and receive their municipal services from the county. In fact, there are no incorporated municipalities at all in Baltimore County or Howard County. The county-equivalent is also the provider of public schools - school districts as a separate level of government do not exist in Maryland.The City of Baltimore generally possesses the same powers and responsibilities as the counties within the state. It is an entity nearly surrounded by but separate from the County of Baltimore, which has its county seat in Towson.The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.  Maryland's code is 24, which when combined with any county code would be written as 24XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.Alphabetical listing                         |}MapDefunct countiesCounty Years of existence Etymology Old Charles County 1650–1654 Charles I, King of England Durham County 1669–1672 The English County Durham Old Worcester County 1672–1685 Mary Arundell, the wife of Sir John Somerset, son of the 1st Marquess of Worcester, and sister of Anne Arundell, wife of Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore References

Wheaton, Maryland Wheaton is an unincorporated, urbanized area in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA, north of Washington, D.C., northwest of Silver Spring. Wheaton takes its name from Frank Wheaton (1833–1903), a career officer in the United States Army and volunteer from Rhode Island in the Union Army who rose to the rank of major-general while serving before, during, and after the American Civil War.Wheaton's boundaries are not officially defined. The United States Census Bureau has not chosen to make Wheaton itself into a Census-Designated Place, but instead combines it with Glenmont into a single Wheaton-Glenmont CDP, centered at  , whose 2000 census population was 57,694. According to Rand McNally, the Greater Wheaton area (which extends beyond Wheaton-Glenmont CDP) had an estimated population of 134,800 in 2005. The United States Geological Survey, however, does consider Wheaton as a place whose center is at latitude  . The United States Postal Service has assigned Zip Code 20902 to Wheaton but the Wheaton Post Office is part of the Silver Spring area. Downtown Wheaton can be found at the intersections of Veirs Mill Road (Md. Rt. 586), University Boulevard (Md. Rt. 193), and Georgia Avenue (Md. Rt. 97).HistoryThe Three Great RoadsWheaton developed from Leesborough (named in 1826), a business district which popped near the junction of three major roads: The first is Brookeville Pike (also known as the "Washington-Brookeville Pike" and later as the "Union Turnpike", now MD Route 97, Georgia Ave) a north/south toll thoroughfare running from Washington, DC to Brookeville, Maryland and eventually to Baltimore, Maryland.The second road, Veirs Mill Road (MD Route 586, named after a grist and sawmill built on Rock Creek by Samuel Clark Veirs in 1838 Historical Marker Database ), was one portion of a much longer thoroughfare connecting westwards to Rockville, Maryland and thence towards the Potomac River and subsequently to Virginia via ferry crossings.  This was also known as the "City Road" in Rockville, and around the time of the American Civil War it was known also as the "New Cut Road." Civil War Defenses of Washington Chapter VII  The History Of Montgomery County, Maryland, From Its Earliest Settlement In 1650 to 1879 (Boyd, T. H. S.) The last of these roads was known as Old Bladensburg Road (now MD Route 193, University Boulevard) which, as it does in present day, connected Georgetown, Bethesda, Chevy Chase, and Bladensburg. A History of Wheaton (Discover Wheaton), Montgomery County Government Mitchell's CrossroadsThe business district subsequently became known as Mitchell's Crossroads in the 1860s referring to Mitchell's Tavern which was located at northeast corner of Union Turnpike (renamed from Brookeville Pike) and Old Bladensburg Road.  Mitchell's Tavern was thought to be over 100 years old in 1865 and stood until 1940 when it was destroyed by a fire. In October 1869, the post office was renamed in honor of General Frank Wheaton by the area's first Postmaster George F. Plyer who served as a Private under Gen. Wheaton in 1861 during the American Civil War.  Gen. Wheaton had become a local folk hero when he successfully defended Washington, DC and nearby Fort Stevens from an attack by Confederate General Jubal Early on July 11–12, 1864. Demographic shiftsIn the 1950s the area was developed with Cape Cod, ranch houses, and split level homes owned by white affluent families.  Now more of the aging housing stock is rented by a diverse population. This table shows the subsequent shift in demographics: Wheaton MD Census dataYear White Hispanic Asian Black Multiracial 1990 61% 13% 10% 15%      2000 38% 29% 12% 17% 6% 2010 26% 42% 12% 18% 5% Between 2000 and 2010, Wheaton's Hispanic population has increased from 29% to 42%. In the past couple of years, since the collapse of the real estate market, high number of properties owned by Hispanics have been repossessed by lenders. Most of these homes were sold and then renovated by investors to be resold to professional White start up families.FeaturesWheaton is home to the Wheaton Regional Park, which includes a nature center; riding stables; dog park; a picnic area with carousel and miniature train; an athletic complex with tennis bubble, ice rink, in-line skating rink, and ball fields; and Brookside Gardens, Montgomery County's award-winning 50-acre (200,000-m²) public display garden. Much of Wheaton was developed in the 1950s. In the 1960s its shopping center, Wheaton Plaza (now known as Westfield Wheaton), was the largest in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. Wheaton is also home to the Wheaton Regional Public Library.  The Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad is located in the Central Business District and is one of the busiest (11,000 calls in 2007) predominantly volunteer fire departments in Montgomery County. The diversity of the neighborhood is reflected by the high concentration of various ethnic restaurants located in Wheaton, as well as in the composition of the student body of Wheaton High School (school website), part of the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS website) and located near the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Randolph Road.It is served by the Red Line of the Washington Metro system.  Spanning 508 feet (155m), the Wheaton Metro station has the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere.    Since Wheaton has the highest location in the Washington, DC area, it was also the home of the first television license in the United States.  Using the call sign W3XK, Charles Francis Jenkins began broadcasting from his home at the corner of Windham Lane and Georgia Ave.   starting on July 2, 1928. Designation as a Maryland Arts and Entertainment DistrictWheaton has been designated by the State of Maryland as an Arts and Entertainment District, joining Silver Spring and Bethesda as the third district in Montgomery County to receive the distinction.

Aspen Hill, Maryland Aspen Hill is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland. It got its name from aspen trees that once were found near the first post office in the area. The post office was located in a general store on what was then known as the Washington-Brookeville Pike (now the intersection of Connecticut and Georgia Avenues) and opened around 1864.Aspen Hill was one of the locations in which a fatal shooting took place in October 2002 as part of the Beltway sniper attacks.GeographyAs an unincorporated area, Aspen Hill's boundaries are not officially defined. The United States Postal Service does not even use the name Aspen Hill (except as a station name in the Silver Spring Post Office), preferring to divide it between Rockville, Silver Spring, and Wheaton. Some addresses are referenced as Wheaton (20906),  notably in the Aspen Hill Shopping Center, while immediately across Aspen Hill Road at the Northgate Plaza Shopping Center, the addresses are in Silver Spring (20906).  Immediately to the west across Connecticut Avenue, addresses are given as being in Rockville (20853).  As a result, statistics such as crime statistics which are reasonably considered as belonging to Aspen Hill are buried in the statistics of three different areas. Aspen Hill straddles a corner where three statistical areas meet in what locals consider the commercial heart of Aspen Hill.The United States Census Bureau, defines Aspen Hill as a Census-Designated Place located at 39°6' North, 77°5' West. In the 2000 Census Bureau Gazetteer, Aspen Hill was located at   (39.088525, -77.080267) .The United States Geological Survey definition of Aspen Hill is centered at  , somewhat different from either of the Census Bureau's definitions.Other organizations, such as the Aspen Hill Civic Association, Inc., have their own definitions. The organizational membership bounds of the Civic Association do not include any areas to the east of Georgia Avenue. Other local resources such as the Montgomery Gazette and the Washington Post use a more broad definition. Generally speaking, if it is not a part of Manor Country Club or Leisure World, and is south of Norbeck Road and north of Veirs Mill Road, east of Rock Creek and west of Bel Pre Creek or Matthew Henson State Park or Matthew Henson Greenway, the local media consider it to be Aspen Hill.According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of  , of which,   of it is land and   of it (0.57%) is water.Demographics As of the census  of 2000, there were 50,228 people, 18,187 households, and 13,076 families residing in the community.

Olney, Maryland  Olney, a census-designated place and an unincorporated area of Montgomery County, Maryland, USA, is located in the north central part of the county, twenty miles (32 km) north of Washington, D.C. It was largely agricultural until the 1960s, when growth of the Washington suburbs led to its conversion into a mostly residential area. As generally defined, Olney had a total population of 31,438 in the 2000 census.  In July 2007, Money magazine ranked Olney as 17 (the highest ranked town in Maryland) out of the top 100 in its "America's Best Places To Live" edition.HistoryOriginally known as Mechanicsville, the village which became Olney was established in 1800. The area was mostly farmland, but it soon began attracting artisans. Early residents Sarah Brooke and Dr. Charles Farquhar were devotees of the English poet William Cowper, and named their home after the poet's hometown. The area was in turn named for their home, which still stands and is known as the Olney House.The Brooke family held the largest tracts of land in Olney, whose central village was at the intersection of the Rockville to Baltimore road, and the one which connected Washington with Westminster, Maryland, to the north. The Quaker community in Sandy Spring thrived just to Olney's east. The Sandy Spring Museum is a historical museum featuring educational programs and displays. St. John's Episcopal Church was established in 1842 and survives to this day.After the siege of Washington by the British in 1814 during the War of 1812, President Madison and his family passed through Olney en route to taking refuge in the neighboring town of Brookeville. Although not as involved in the Civil War as areas of Maryland to the west, Olney residents still experienced the tug-of-war between loyalty to the plantation economy of the South and to the Federal government in Maryland's midst.GeographyAs an unincorporated area, Olney's boundaries are not officially defined. The United States Census Bureau defines a Census-Designated Place of Olney centered at 39°9' North and 77°5' West. It has a total area of  .

College Park, Maryland College Park is a city in Prince George's County, Maryland, USA.  The population was 30,413 at the 2010 census. It is best known as the home of the University of Maryland, College Park, and since 1994 the city has also been home to the "Archives II" facility of the U.S. National Archives.College Park's United States Postal Service ZIP codes are 20740, 20741 (Berwyn Heights; North College Park) and 20742 (University of Maryland).Bordering areasBeltsville  (North)Berwyn Heights (East)University Park (Southwest)Riverdale Park (South)Adelphi (West)Hyattsville (Southwest)GeographyCollege Park is located at   (38.996560, -76.927509). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.   HistoryCollege Park was developed beginning in 1889 near the Maryland Agricultural College (later the University of Maryland) and the  College Station stop of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The suburb was incorporated in 1945 and included the subdivisions of College Park, Lakeland, Berwyn, Oak Spring, Branchville, Daniel's Park, and Hollywood.  The original College Park subdivision was first plotted in 1872 by Eugene Campbell. The area remained undeveloped and was re-platted in 1889 by John O. Johnson and Samuel Curriden, Washington real estate developers. The original   tract was divided into a grid-street pattern with long, narrow building lots, with a standard lot size of   by  . College Park developed rapidly, catering to those who were seeking to escape the crowded Washington, D.C., as well as to a rapidly expanding staff of college faculty and employees. College Park originally included single-family residences constructed in the Shingle, Queen Anne, and Stick styles, as well as modest vernacular dwellings.  Commercial development increased in the 1920s, aided by the increased automobile traffic and the growing campus along Baltimore Avenue / Route 1.  By the late 1930s, most of the original subdivision had been partially developed. Several fraternities and sororities from the University of Maryland built houses in the neighborhood. After World War II, construction consisted mostly of infill of ranch and split-level houses. After incorporation in 1945, the city continued to grow and build a municipal center in 1959.   The Lakeland neighborhood was developed beginning in 1892 around the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, whose Branchville and Calvert Road depots were located approximately one mile to the north and south, respectively. Lakeland was created by Edwin Newman, who improved the original   located to the west of the railroad. He also built a number of the original homes, a small town hall, and a general store. The area was originally envisioned as a resort-type community around Lake Artemesia. However, due to the flood-prone, low-lying topography, the neighborhood attracted a lower-income population became an area for African-American settlement. Around 1900, the Baltimore Gold Fish Company built five artificial lakes in the area to spawn goldfish and rare species of fish. A one-room school was built in 1903 for the African-American population; a new school was built in 1925. The Berwyn neighborhood was developed beginning about 1885 adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It was created by Francis Shannabrook, a Pennsylvanian who purchased a tract of land between Baltimore Avenue and the railroad tracks. Shannabrook established a small depot, built a general store, and erected approximately 15 homes in the area to attract moderate-income families looking to move out of Washington. The neighborhood began to grow after 1900 when the City and Suburban Electric Railway entered the area. By 1925 there were approximately 100 single-family homes; mostly two-story, wood-frame buildings. The community housing continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s with one story bungalows, capes, and victorians, and later grew to include raised ranches and split level homes. The Daniels Park neighborhood was developed beginning in 1905 on the east and west sides of the City and Suburban Electric Railway in north College Park. Daniels Park was created by Edward Daniels on   of land. This small residential subdivisionwas improved with single-family houses arranged along a grid pattern of streets. The houses range in style from American Foursquares to bungalows, and were built between 1905 and the 1930s. The Hollywood neighborhood was developed beginning in the early 20th century along the City and Suburban Electric Railway. Edward Daniels, the developer of Daniels Park, planned the Hollywood subdivision as a northern extension of that earlier community. Development in Hollywood was slow until after World War II when Albert Turner acquired large tracts of the northern part of the neighborhood in the late 1940s.  Turner was able to develop and market brick and frame three-bedroom bungalows beginning in 1950. By 1952, an elementary school had been built. The Hollywood Park, a   facility along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, is operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. Spring TrainingIn 1943, the Washington Senators held Spring Training camp in College Park. In order to conserve rail transport during World War II, the 1943 Spring Training was limited to an area east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River. September 2001 tornado  On September 24, 2001, a violent, multiple-vortex F3 tornado hit the area. This storm moved at peak intensity through the University of Maryland, College Park campus, and then moved parallel to I-95 through the Laurel area, where F3 damage was also noted. The damage path from this storm was measured at   in length, and this tornado caused two deaths and 55 injuries, along with $101 million in property damage. The two deaths were sisters who died when their car was picked up and hurled over a building before being slammed to the ground; both young women were University of Maryland students.This tornado was part of the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., tornado outbreak of 2001, one of the most dramatic recent tornado events to directly affect the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.The first tornado of the outbreak was also the strongest – an F4 (see Fujita scale) tornado that left a  -long damage path through rural Culpeper and Fauquier Counties in Virginia. Weak (F1) tornadoes east of Warrenton, and just west of Dulles International Airport soon followed.A second supercell to the southeast spawned the family of tornadoes that moved through Washington. A first tornado (F0) was confirmed in the Quantico and Prince William Forest Park areas; this was soon followed by an F1 tornado that left a  -long path parallel to I-95 and I-395 through Franconia, western Alexandria and Arlington. This tornado dissipated near the west end of the Mall in Washington, D.C., and was followed by many reports of funnel clouds. This same storm produced the F3 tornado that roared through College Park.Historic sitesThe following is a list of historic sites in College Park identified by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.

Both students and city residents have decried the city's lack of amenities and poor sense of place. In 2002, the city and county passed the Route 1 Sector Plan, which allowed and encouraged mixed use development on College Park's main roadway.Recent projects like the East Campus Redevelopment Initiative, the University View and Northgate Condos give many in the community hope that the city may one day be like other notable college towns around the country, with a vibrant downtown and a diverse population. A full list of current projects in the pipeline can be found on the City of College Park's Economic Development Updates.The University of Maryland's Student Government Association sponsored a design charrette in April 2006 to envision the future of College Park. In July 2006, a group of students created Rethink College Park—a community group providing a website to share information about development and encourage public dialogue.Currently, in the year 2010, there have been notable architectural additions to the city of College Park, Maryland. A parking garage was completed in the downtown area in August 2009 near the intersection of Route 1 and Knox Road.

Occasionally, University of Maryland students plan voter registration drives and seek to elect one of their own to the city council.  City residents, including students living within the city are eligible  to run for city council if they are over the age of 21.  Over the past twenty years there have been multiple attempts, none of which were successful until Marcus Afzali won a seat in 2009.1993 – Dana L. Loewenstein & Michael J. Moore – Perhaps the most controversial of all student races was that of Loewenstein, a former president of the Panhellenic Association, the sorority umbrella organization at the university.  A year after she had lost the election, she was charged with 16 counts of perjury, 16 counts of aiding and advising to falsely register voters and faced a maximum prison sentence of over 200+ years.  Ms. Loewenstein's opponent in the council race, Michael Smith, joined former council member Chester Joy in filing a complaint with the Prince George's County Board of Elections days before the Nov. 2 election.  The complaint alleged that 16 of her sorority pledges lived in one district but registered in another.  The complaint was turned over to the state's attorney, who filed criminal charges against Loewenstein a year after she lost the election.  The complaint alleged that all of the pledges lived in on-campus dorms but used the Sigma Delta Tau house address as their residence.  At trial, the 16 sorority pledges testified they signed the registration cards during their first meeting, when they were probationary members.  Loewenstein was found not guilty by the Circuit Court.2001 – Mike Mann & Daniel Dorfman – In November 2001, Michael Mann  and Daniel Dorfman, sought the two District 3 seats on the College Park City Council.  Campaigning against incumbent Eric Olson and for an open seat created by then-councilman Brayman's decision to run for mayor, the two campaigned heavily to inform students there was a council race going on that year, and registered over 700 students to vote in the municipal election. Despite their hard work and an almost year-long campaign, they were defeated.2007 – Nick Aragon – In January 2007, Nick Aragon lost a special election for the city council.  Two incumbents created a vacancy when they were elected to higher county offices.  In turn, the city was forced to hold a special election after the November 2006 elections.  The city chose an election date during the university's winter recess, a time when many students were away from the city.  With some help from the Student Government Association (SGA)  and an endorsement by College Park Mayor Steve Brayman, the Aragon campaign encouraged students to use absentee ballots, although few actually did, and Aragon lost the election.2009- Marcus Afzali- Marcus Afzali, a 24-year-old doctoral student in the Department of Government and Politics at UMD, won a seat on the city council representing District 4 in November 2009. Afzali attributed displays of "energy"--exemplified by taking time to knock on doors and reach out to residents—as the cause behind his success. The 2009 election is notable not only for Afzali's performance at the polls, but for the fact that both District 4 incumbents lost.

List of Governors of MarylandNumber of Governors of Maryland by party affiliation Party Governors Democratic 29 Federalist 9 Democratic-Republican 9 Republican 6 No Party 5 Whig 3 National Republican 2 American 1 Unionist 1  The following is a list of the Governors of Maryland from independence to the present day. The Governor of Maryland heads the executive branch of the government of the U.S. state of Maryland and is commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.    He or she is the highest-ranking official in the state, and the constitutional powers of Maryland's Governors make them among the most powerful in the United States. Since the American Revolution, Maryland has had a number of state constitutions that have specified different terms of office and methods of selection of its Governors. Under the constitution of 1776, the Governors were appointed by the legislature to one year terms. An 1838 constitutional amendment allowed the direct election of Governors to three-year terms, although the Governors came from rotating election districts. The terms were lengthened to four years in the 1851 Constitution and the election districts were abolished in the 1864 version.

Scouting in MarylandScouting in Maryland has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving millions of youth with activities that have adapted to the changing cultural environment but have always been rooted in an active outdoor program.Early history (1910-1950)The 1923 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meeting was held at Baltimore, Maryland. In the early 1920s, there were several camps named Rodney in the Delmarva area. However, the current Rodney Scout Reservation was established in 1921.Recent history (1950-1990) Boy Scouts of AmericaThere are six Boy Scouts of America local councils in Maryland, all within the Northeast Region.Baltimore Area Council The Baltimore Area Council includes thirteen districts:Arrowhead DistrictThurgood Marshall District (formerly Babe Ruth District)Carroll DistrictChesapeake DistrictDulaney DistrictFour Rivers DistrictHarford DistrictHopkins DistrictNational Pike DistrictReginald F. Lewis District (formerly Scoutreach District)The Capitol DistrictPathfinders DistrictLearning For Life DistrictBaltimore Area Council partners with approximately 800 community based organizations providing programs to more than 35,000 youth each year.Baltimore Area Council operates three full service Scout Shops either directly or thru license with the National Council, Boy Scouts of America in Baltimore City, Hanover and Whiteford in Harford County, Maryland. The Harford Scout Shop is located in Camp Saffran at Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation at 1929 Susquehanna Hall Road Whiteford, Maryland. The Dorsey Road Scout Shop is located at 7502 Connelley Dr Ste 117, Hanover, Maryland. The Baltimore Scout Shop is actually located directly across the street from the Council's Shapiro Scout Service Center in the Stieff Silver Building at 800 Wyman Park Drive, Baltimore Maryland.  The Council also operates a Help Desk that serves Scout volunteers and Scout parents at the Baltimore Scout Shop.In 2008, Baltimore Area Council announced ten top initiative programs to highlight the Boy Scouts of America 100th Anniversary in 2010. The Top Ten Initiatives are: Star-Spangled Camporee at Ft. McHenry and surrounding City Parks, Scout Sunday And Sabbath, Anniversary Black Tie Gala, Gathering of Eagles, Flag Ceremonies, the 100 Great Moments in Baltimore Area Scouting History, Birthday Card Contest, Scouting Mural/Mosaic Project and the 100th Anniversary Service Project.In February 2009, the Star-Spangled Banner Flag or the Great Garrison Flag (also known as the 15 Star Flag) was officially adopted as the Official U.S. Flag of the Baltimore Area Council, Boy Scouts of America by authority of the Council Executive Board.  A public ceremony was conducted on February 8, 2009, on the occasion of the 99th Anniversary of the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America in Washington, D.C., by William D. Boyce, a Chicago publisher.  Representatives of Scout Units, Districts, the Council and the public were on hand to commemorate the adoption at the Shapiro Scout Service Center.

Website:      Broad Creek land was first acquired in 1946.  Over   of land are owned and/or operated by BAC.  It has operated as a Scout camp since 1948 and is one of the five largest blocks of contiguous forest in the traditional (western shore) Baltimore metropolitan area, and the largest such private forested area.  In 2009, a new Rosenberg Welcome Center, formerly the Reservation HQ, and the expansion of the Dining Hall Pavilion at Camp Oest were constructed to accommodate attendance growth and goals in the 2008-2012 Baltimore Area Council Strategic Plan.Broad Creek has three primary camps, two secondary camps, plus a large natural area including the largest hemlock forest east of the mountains in Maryland.  Several pine plantations were  planted in 1949-51 and felled in 2006-7 due to beetle infestations.The primary camps are called Camp Saffran (named after Frederick A. Saffran), Camp Spencer (named after William B. Spencer), and Camp Oest (named after E. Wallace Oest). Camps Saffran and Spencer operate as Boy Scout summer camps and Camp Oest as a Cub Scout resident summer camp.  Camp Saffran's Middle Ridge area features a high ropes "COPE" challenge course and zip line.Of the secondary camps, Camp Cone's remote Houck Lodge is often used by non-scout groups and for training events and, along with Camp Finney, the forests are used for hiking, backpack camping, and orienteering, with paddling access to both the mile-long Lake Straus waters and to the huge Conowingo Reservoir (Susquehanna River).  All of the camps in BCMSR are named for a person with an early history of long service to the council.The hemlocks stand includes the largest Eastern Hemlock in the state of Maryland (officially designated as of July 3, 2007.)  A fund-raising campaign started in 2005 allows for ongoing treatment by volunteers of over 2,000 individual hemlock trees for  protection against the invasive woolly adelgid hemlocks infestation.A Broad Creek "Camporall" in the fall of 1979, just a few years after national and Maryland scout membership numbers peaked, attracted approximately 4000 participants, mostly to Camp Finney.  A September 1998 50th anniversary celebration attracted approximately 2800 participants.  Even winter weekends with no special district or council events have attracted up to 1700 campers at this busy year-round facility.Del-Mar-Va Council Del-Mar-Va Council serves Scouts in Delaware and the eastern shore portions (east of the Chesapeake Bay) of  Maryland and Virginia.Rodney Scout Reservation, also known as Camp Rodney or simply RSR, is a Boy Scout camp located near North East, Maryland.

Chevy Chase, Maryland Chevy Chase is the name of both a town and an unincorporated census-designated place (CDP) in Montgomery County, Maryland.  In addition, a number of villages in the same area of Montgomery County include "Chevy Chase" in their names.  These villages, the town, and the CDP share a common history and together form a larger community colloquially referred to as "Chevy Chase."  This community is roughly centered on Connecticut Avenue north of the District of Columbia and also includes a neighborhood of Washington, D.C., called Chevy Chase, D.C.Primarily a residential suburb, Chevy Chase also borders a popular shopping district, Friendship Heights, featuring several malls and a variety of shops and restaurants. Chevy Chase is home to the National 4-H Center, where the National Science Bowl is held in late April or early May.Chevy Chase is served by the Montgomery County Public Schools.HistoryChevy Chase was unincorporated farmland in the years before 1890, during which time Senator Francis G. Newlands of Nevada and his partners began the aggressive acquisition of land in northwestern Washington, D.C., and southern Montgomery County, Maryland, for the purpose of developing a residential streetcar suburb for Washington, DC. (See Washington streetcars.)  The Chevy Chase Land Company was founded in 1890, and its eventual holdings of more than   would extend along the present-day Connecticut Avenue from Florida Avenue north to Jones Bridge Road.  The Chevy Chase Land Company would build houses for no less than $5,000 on Connecticut Avenue or less than $3,000 on a side street.  The name "Chevy Chase" was taken from one of the absorbed plots of land. Its name in turn, according to the Village of Chevy Chase's official history, can be traced to the larger tract of land called "Cheivy Chace" that was patented to Colonel Joseph Belt from Lord Baltimore on July 10, 1725. It has historic associations to a 1388 battle between Lord Percy of England and Earl Douglas of Scotland. At issue in this "chevauchée" (a French word describing a border raid) were hunting grounds or a "chace" in the Cheviot Hills of Northumberland and Otterburn. Like many suburban towns throughout the United States during the first half of the 20th century, Chevy Chase excluded individuals based on race and religion.  Founder Francis G. Newlands was an "avowed racist" Fisher, Marc.  "Chevy Chase, 1916: For Everyman, a New Lot in Life,"  Washington Post, February 15, 1999  who in 1912 mounted his presidential campaign on a platform that called for a constitutional amendment to disenfranchise black men and limit immigration to whites only. Three years earlier, the Chevy Chase Land Company had brought suit against a developer who had begun to sell lots to black people in a planned subdivision called "Belmont" on the grounds that the developer had committed fraud by proposing "to sell lots...to negroes." By the 1920s, exclusionary language had begun to appear in Chevy Chase real estate deeds.  Some prohibited both the sale or rental of homes to "a Negro or one of the African race."   Others prohibited sales or rentals to "any persons of the Semetic (sic) race."  By World War II, such restrictive language had largely disappeared from real estate transactions, and all were voided by the Supreme Court's 1948 decision in Shelley v. Kraemer.VillagesChevy Chase (CDP), MarylandChevy Chase (town), MarylandChevy Chase Village, MarylandVillage of Chevy Chase Section Three, MarylandVillage of Chevy Chase Section Five, MarylandVillage of Martin's Additions, MarylandVillage of North Chevy Chase, MarylandIn addition to the above, the United States Postal Service uses "Chevy Chase" for postal addresses that lie in the Town of Somerset and the Village of Friendship Heights which lie outside historical Chevy Chase. USPS also considers addresses east of Jones Mill Rd./Beach Dr. and west of Grubb Rd. as a part of Chevy Chase,  although according to the United States Census Bureau this is part of the Silver Spring CDP.See alsoFrancis G.

McCulloch v. Maryland   McCulloch v. Maryland,  , was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. The state of Maryland had attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the U.S. Bank. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution.This case established two important principles in constitutional law. First, the Constitution grants to Congress implied powers for implementing the Constitution's express powers, in order to create a functional national government. Second, state action may not impede valid constitutional exercises of power by the Federal government.BackgroundOn April 8, 1816, the Congress of the United States passed an act titled "An Act to Incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank of the United States" which provided for the incorporation of the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank first went into full operation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1817, the Bank opened a branch in Baltimore, Maryland, and transacted and carried on business as a branch of the Bank of the United States by issuing bank notes, discounting promissory notes, and performing other operations usual and customary for banks to do and perform. Both sides of the litigation admitted that the President, directors, and company of the Bank had no authority to establish the Baltimore branch, or office of discount and deposit, other than the fact that Maryland had adopted the Constitution of the United States.On February 11, 1818, the General Assembly of Maryland passed an act titled, "an act to impose a tax on all banks, or branches thereof, in the State of Maryland, not chartered by the legislature": Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland that if any bank has established or shall, without authority from the State first had and obtained establish any branch, office of discount and deposit, or office of pay and receipt in any part of this State, it shall not be lawful for the said branch, office of discount and deposit, or office of pay and receipt to issue notes, in any manner, of any other denomination than five, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, five hundred and one thousand dollars, and no note shall be issued except upon stamped paper of the following denominations; that is to say, every five dollar note shall be upon a stamp of ten cents; every ten dollar note, upon a stamp of twenty cents; every twenty dollar note, upon a stamp of thirty cents; every fifty dollar note, upon a stamp of fifty cents; every one hundred dollar note, upon a stamp of one dollar; every five hundred dollar note, upon a stamp of ten dollars; and every thousand dollar note, upon a stamp of twenty dollars; which paper shall be furnished by the Treasurer of the Western Shore, under the direction of the Governor and Council, to be paid for upon delivery; provided always that any institution of the above description may relieve itself from the operation of the provisions aforesaid by paying annually, in advance, to the Treasurer of the Western Shore, for the use of State, the sum of $15,000.  And be it enacted that the President, cashier, each of the directors and officers of every institution established or to be established as aforesaid, offending against the provisions aforesaid shall forfeit a sum of $500 for each and every offence, and every person having any agency in circulating any note aforesaid, not stamped as aforesaid directed, shall forfeit a sum not exceeding $100, every penalty aforesaid to be recovered by indictment or action of debt in the county court of the county where the offence shall be committed, one-half to the informer and the other half to the use of the State... James William McCulloch, head of the Baltimore Branch of the Second Bank of the United States, refused to pay the tax. The lawsuit was filed by John James, an informer who sought to collect one half of the fine as provided for by the statute. The case was appealed to the Maryland Court of Appeals where the state of Maryland argued that "the Constitution is silent on the subject of banks."  It was Maryland's contention that because the Constitution did not specifically state that the federal government was authorized to charter a bank, the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional.  The court upheld Maryland.  The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court.Supreme Court decisionThe Court determined that Congress did have the power to create the Bank.  Chief Justice Marshall supported this conclusion with four main arguments.   First, he argued that historical practice established Congress' power to create the Bank. Marshall invoked the first Bank of the United States history as authority for the constitutionality of the second bank.  The first Congress enacted the bank after great debate and that it was approved by an executive "with as much preserving talent as any measure has ever experienced, and being supported by arguments which convinced minds as pure and as intelligent as this country can boast." Second, Chief Justice Marshall refuted the argument that states retain ultimate sovereignty because they ratified the constitution. "The powers of the general government, it has been said, are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion."  Marshall contended that it was the people who ratified the Constitution and thus the people are sovereign, not the states. Third, Marshall addressed the scope of congressional powers under Article I. The Court broadly described Congress' authority before addressing the necessary and proper clause.  Marshall admitted that the Constitution does not enumerate a power to create a central Bank but said that this is not dispositive as to Congress's power to establish such an institution.  Chief Justice Marshall wrote, "In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding." Fourth, Marshall supported the Court's opinion textually by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause, which permits Congress to seek an objective that is within its enumerated powers so long as it is rationally related to the objective and not forbidden by the Constitution.  In liberally interpreting the Necessary and Proper clause, the Court naturally rejected Maryland's narrow interpretation of the clause, which purported that the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause meant that Congress could only pass those laws which were absolutely essential in the execution of its enumerated powers.  The Court rejected this argument, on the grounds that many of the enumerated powers of Congress under the Constitution would be useless if only those laws deemed essential to a power's execution could be passed.  Marshall also noted that the Necessary and Proper Clause is listed within the powers of Congress, not the limitations.The Court held that for these reasons, the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause does not refer to the only way of doing something, but rather applies to various procedures for implementing all constitutionally established powers.  "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional."This principle had been established many years earlier by Alexander Hamilton:   Chief Justice Marshall also determined that Maryland may not tax the bank without violating the Constitution.  The Court voided the tax on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. The opinion stated that Congress has implied powers that need to be related to the text of the Constitution, but need not be enumerated within the text.  This case was a seminal moment in the formation of a balance between federalism, federal power, and states' powers. Chief Justice Marshall also explained in this case that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not require that all federal laws be necessary and proper and that federal laws that are enacted directly pursuant to one of the express, enumerated powers granted by the Constitution need not comply with the Necessary and Proper Clause, holding that the clause "purport[s] to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the government. It purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already granted."Later historyMcCulloch v. Maryland was cited in the first substantial constitutional case presented before the High Court of Australia in D'Emden v Pedder (1904), which dealt with similar issues in the Australian Federation. While recognizing American law as not binding on them, the Australian Court nevertheless determined that the McCulloch decision provided the best guideline for the relationship between the Commonwealth federal government, and the Australian States, owing in large part to strong similarities between the American and Australian constitutions.See alsoList of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 17List of landmark court decisions in the United StatesDaniel WebsterCase of Sutton's Hospital (1612) 77 Eng Rep 960References Further readingRichard Ellis, Aggressive Nationalism: McCulloch v.

Queen Anne, MarylandThis article is about the town in Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, for the town in Prince George's County, see Queen Anne, Prince George's County, Maryland Queen Anne is a town in Queen Anne's and Talbot counties in the U.S. state of Maryland. The population was 222 at the 2010 census. GeographyQueen Anne is located at   (38.919039, -75.952827). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of  , all of it land.   Tuckahoe Creek passes by the town. The birthplace of Frederick Douglass is 2–3 miles south, near the banks of the Tuckahoe.   Maryland Route 404 passes to the north of town. Tuckahoe State Park is a short ride north of MD 404. The border between Talbot County and Queen Anne's County runs through the middle of town.HistoryAccording to the Maryland Municipal League:   In the 1850s, the area that is now the town of Queen Anne, was part of a 225-acre farm owned by Jacob Morgan. Initially, the town nucleus was nothing but a 1½-story dwelling, but in 1864 Mr. Morgan built a more substantial place—it was known locally as “the mansion house,” and the locale was known as Morganville. At that time, the Pennsylvania Railroad had been laid as far south as Greensboro and, a little later, to Ridgely and Hillsboro and thence across Tuckahoe Creek. In 1878, the railroad purchased a site for a station across the creek in Queen Anne’s County, and, quite logically, named it Queen Anne when the station was finally put into service about 1882.Demographics2010 censusAs of the census    of 2010, there were 222 people, 83 households, and 54 families residing in the town.

USS Maryland (ACR-8)  {Infobox ship image}}   The second USS Maryland (ACR-8), also referred to as "Armored Cruiser 8", and later renamed Frederick, was a United States Navy   armored cruiser.She was laid down on 7 October 1901 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, launched on 12 September 1903, sponsored by Miss Jennie Scott Waters; and commissioned on 18 April 1905, Captain R. R. Ingersoll in command.Service historyPre-World War IIn October 1905, following shakedown, Maryland joined the Atlantic Fleet for operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean, where she took part in the 1906 winter maneuvers off Cuba. The next summer, she conducted a training cruise for Massachusetts Naval Militiamen, and then readied for transfer to the Pacific. Departing Newport on 8 September 1906, she sailed – via San Francisco and Hawaii — for the Asiatic Station, where she remained until October 1907. She then returned to San Francisco and for the next decade she cruised throughout the Pacific, participating in survey missions to Alaska (1912 and 1913); carrying United States Secretary of State Knox to Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Meiji Tenno (September 1912); steaming off the Central American coast to aid, if necessary, Americans endangered by political turmoil in Mexico and Nicaragua (1913, 1914, and 1916); and making numerous training cruises to Hawaii and the South-Central Pacific.World War IWhen the United States Congress declared war on Imperial Germany on 6 April 1917, the armored cruiser, renamed Frederick---in order to free up her original name for use with the Colorado-class battleship  ---on 9 November 1916, was en route from Puget Sound to San Francisco. Taking on men and supplies at the latter port, she got underway for the Atlantic. From May 1917 – January 1918, she patrolled the southeastern Atlantic off the coast of South America. On 1 February, she was assigned to escort duty in the North Atlantic, and until the signing of the Armistice, she convoyed troopships east of the 37th meridian. By 20 November, she was attached to the Cruiser and Destroyer Force, and before mid-1919 had completed six round trips returning troops from France. Detached from that duty, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was briefly placed in reduced commission.Inter-war periodFrederick crossed the Atlantic again, carrying the US Olympic Team to Antwerp, Belgium, as she conducted a naval reservist training cruise in July 1920. At the end of that year, she returned to the Pacific Fleet. Serving as flagship of the Train, Pacific Fleet, for the next year, she conducted only one lengthy cruise, to South America in March 1921. Operations off the west coast took up the remainder of her active duty career, and on 14 February 1922 she decommissioned and entered the Reserve Fleet at Mare Island. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November 1929 and sold on 11 February 1930.In 1921, Frederick was used for several scenes in Harold Lloyd's first full-length film, the comedy A Sailor-Made Man. Camera (vol. 4, no. 29, p. 8) mentions a dinner party for the cast that was given by the officers of the ship.References  Alden, John D.

USS Maryland (BB-46) {Infobox ship image}}   USS Maryland (BB-46), also known as "Old Mary" or "Fighting Mary" to her crewmates, was a   during World War II. She was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the seventh state. She was commissioned in 1920 and, serving as the flagship of the fleet, cruised to Australia, New Zealand and Brazil.She is most notable for her service in World War II. She was present on Battleship Row during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and was lightly damaged by Japanese bombs. Returning to duty in 1942, she saw service in the Pacific War, first supporting the rest of the fleet at the Battle of Midway, and then patrolling the Fiji Islands to guard against Japanese incursion. Next, she  went on the offensive, commencing shore bombardments in  the Battle of Tarawa and later in the Battle of Kwajalein. During the Battle of Saipan she took torpedo damage to her bow, necessitating repairs and refits. She then participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf where she was hit by a kamikaze. She took another kamikaze hit at the Battle of Okinawa, and was in for repairs at the end of WWII.After service in Operation Magic Carpet, she was decommissioned in 1947 and sold for scrap. She received seven battle stars for WWII service.Construction Maryland was one of four dreadnought battleships of the Colorado class to be constructed. Her keel was laid down on 24 April 1917 by Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 20 March 1920, and sponsored by Mrs. E. Brook Lee daughter-in-law of U.S. Senator from Maryland Blair Lee; she was commissioned on 21 July 1921, with Captain C.F. Preston in command.  She was the third ship named for the state of Maryland, the first Maryland was a sloop commissioned in 1799 and the second Maryland was an armored cruiser commissioned in 1905. Maryland had an overall length of  . She had an extreme beam of   and a mean draft of  . She displaced  . Her armor was   at its maximum thickness. Her designed speed was 21 knots. Her crew complement consisted of 58 officers and 1,022 men. Marylands main battery consisted of eight 16 in (406 mm)/45  caliber Mark 6 in four double turrets (two in a superfiring pair forward, two in a superfiring pair mounted aft of the main superstructure) that were capable of firing   armor-piercing (AP) Mark 8 shells.    Her secondary battery consisted of twelve 5"/51 caliber guns as well as eight 3"/50 caliber guns. She was also armed with a pair of   submerged torpedo tubes.  She was outfitted with a new type of seaplane catapult and the first   guns mounted on a U.S. ship. Service historyInter-war periodFollowing her commissioning, Maryland undertook an East Coast shakedown cruise.  Shortly thereafter, Maryland was made flagship of Admiral Hilary P. Jones.  Maryland found herself in great demand for special occasions. She appeared at Annapolis, Maryland, for the 1922 United States Naval Academy graduation and at Boston, Massachusetts, for the anniversary of the battle of Bunker Hill and the Fourth of July.  From 18 August to 25 September, she paid her first visit to a foreign port transporting Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes to Rio de Janeiro for Brazil's Centennial Exposition. The next year, after fleet exercises off the Panama Canal Zone, Maryland transited the canal in the latter part of June to join the battle fleet stationed on the west coast.  She continued to be a flagship until 1923 when the flag was shifted to Pennsylvania. She made another voyage to a foreign port in 1925, this time to Australia and New Zealand. Several years later, in 1928, she transported President-elect Herbert Hoover on the Pacific leg of his tour of Latin America.  She was overhauled in 1928–1929, and the eight   anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight  /25 cal guns.  Throughout these years and the 1930s, she served as a mainstay of fleet readiness through tireless training operations.  She conducted numerous patrols in the 1930s. In 1940, Maryland and the other battleships of the battle force changed their bases of operations to Pearl Harbor.  She was present at Battleship Row along Ford Island during the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. Attack on Pearl Harbor  On the morning of 7 December, Maryland was moored along Ford Island, with Oklahoma to port, connected by lines and a gangway. To her fore was California, while Tennessee and West Virginia were astern. Further aft were Nevada and Arizona. The eight battleships, in what is now known as "Battleship Row," has recently returned from maneuvers. Many of Marylands crew were preparing for shore leave at 09:00 or eating breakfast when the Japanese attack began. As the first Japanese aircraft appeared and explosions rocked the outboard battleships, Maryland 's bugler blew general quarters. Seaman Leslie Short—addressing Christmas cards near his machine gun—brought the first of his ship's guns into play, shooting down one of two torpedo bombers that had just released against  . Inboard of Oklahoma, and thus protected from the initial torpedo attack, Maryland managed to bring all her antiaircraft (AA) batteries into action.  The devastating initial attack sunk Oklahoma, and she capsized quickly, with many of her surviving men climbing aboard Maryland to assist her with anti-aircraft defenses. Maryland was struck by two armor-piercing bombs which detonated low on her hull.  The first struck the forecastle awning and made a hole about   by  .  The second exploded after entering the hull at the   water level at Frame 10.  The latter hit caused flooding and increased the draft forward by  .  Maryland continued to fire and, after the attack, sent firefighting parties to assist her sister ships, especially attempting to rescue survivors from the capsized Oklahoma.  The men continued to muster the AA defenses in case the Japanese returned to attack. In all, two officers and two men were killed in the attack. The Japanese erroneously announced that Maryland had been sunk, but on 30 December, the damaged ship entered Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs just behind Tennessee.  Two of the original twelve 5 in/51 cal guns were removed and the 5 in/25 cal guns were replaced by an equal number of 5 in/38 cal dual purpose guns.  Over the course of several months, she was repaired and overhauled, receiving new fighting equipment. Repairs were complete on 26 February 1942.  She then underwent a series of shakedown cruises to West Coast ports and the Christmas Islands. She was sent back into action in June 1942, the first ship damaged at Pearl Harbor to return to duty. Supporting patrolsDuring the important Battle of Midway, Maryland played a supporting role. Like the other older battleships, she was not fast enough to accompany the aircraft carriers, so she operated with a backup fleet.  Maryland stood by on security, awaiting call from other ships if she was needed, until the end of the battle. At the end of the action around Midway, Maryland was sent to San Francisco. Thereafter, Maryland engaged in almost constant training exercises with Battleship Division 2, Battleship Division 3, and Battleship Division 4 until 1 August, when she returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs, her first time in the harbor since the Japanese attack. She departed Pearl Harbor in early November with Colorado, bound for the forward area.  On 12 November, the pig mascot King Neptune came aboard Maryland to initiate her "pollywogs" for the line-crossing ceremony. Maryland steamed for the Fiji Islands where she patrolled against Japanese incursion. The two battleships acted as sentinels to guard against Japanese advance to prevent Japanese forces from threatening Australia. During this duty, the two battleships conducted frequent sweeps for Japanese forces. In early 1943, with the success of the Solomon Islands campaign, Allied forces went on the offensive. In February 1943, Maryland and Colorado moved to New Hebrides, operating off of Efate.  Intense heat there proved difficult and unpleasant for the crew. She then moved to Espiritu Santo to guard against Japanese incursion, but heat and heavy rains plagued this tour of duty.  Maryland and Colorado stood out of Aore Island Harbor in August. During a five-week overhaul at Pearl Harbor's shipyard, several   AA guns were installed on the top decks and foremast as protection against anticipated Japanese air raids in future operations. Battle of TarawaDeparting the Hawaiian Islands on 20 October for the South Pacific, Maryland became flagship for Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill's V Amphibious Force and Southern Attack Force in the Gilbert Islands Invasion.  Also aboard her were Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of 2nd Marine Division, General "Howling Mad" Smith, commander of the Marine landing forces, and Colonel Evans Carlson, commander of Carlson's Raiders. Maryland returned to Efate Island staging area, where she joined a large task force preparing to an assault on Tarawa. The battle of Tarawa commenced on 20 November. In her first offensive action of the war, Marylands guns opened fire at 05:00, destroying a shore battery with five salvos on the southwestern point of Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll. At 06:00 she commenced a scheduled shore bombardment to soften up Japanese defenses ahead the landings.  Maryland moved closer to shore to attract Japanese fire and locate artillery emplacements, in the process raking Japanese gun emplacements, control stations, pillboxes and any Japanese installations she could spot. At 09:00 as Marine landing forces encountered heavy Japanese resistance and began taking casualties to emplaced crossfire, Maryland provided covering fire to eliminate several Japanese machine gun nests. Her scouting plane then began to cover the progress of the Marines' assault, with Maryland providing artillery support. The plane was damaged and pilot wounded in this action. After three days of covering the offensive on Betio Island, she moved to Apamama Island to guard Marine landings there.  Marines met with only light resistance from 30 Japanese soldiers there, and two prisoners were brought to Maryland. On 7 December, Maryland left Apamama Island for Pearl Harbor. After a brief stopover there, Maryland left for San Francisco for repairs. Battle of Kwajalein AtollMaryland steamed from San Pedro, California on 13 January 1944, rendezvoused with Task Force 53 at Lahania Roads for two days of loading ammunition, refueling, and provisioning ahead of a new operation supporting the Marshall Islands campaign.  On 30 January 1944, she moved to support landings on Roi Island, along with Santa Fe, Biloxi, and Indianapolis, which formed the Northern Support Group of TF 35. In the predawn hours of 31 January, the ships began a bombardment of Kwajalein Atoll, the opening moves of the battle of Kwajalein.  Maryland destroyed numerous Japanese stationary guns and pillboxes. In the course of the battle, she fired so much that she split the liners in the guns of Turret No. 1, putting it out of action for the rest of the day. On 1 February, she continued her attack on Japanese positions as the U.S. landing forces advanced. She became the flagship for Admiral Connally for the next two weeks, resupplying and refueling many of the smaller ships in the operation until she departed with a task unit of carriers and destroyers on 15 February 1944, steaming for Bremerton Navy Yard, where she underwent another overhaul, with her guns being replaced. Battle of SaipanTwo months later, Maryland sailed westward on 5 May, joining Task Force 52 headed for Saipan.  Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner allotted TF 52 three days to soften up the island's defenses ahead of the assault. Firing commenced at 05:45 on 14 June.  The quickly destroyed two coastal guns before she began bombarding Garapan, destroying ammunition dumps, gun positions, small boats, storage tanks, blockhouses and buildings. She then turned her guns to Tanapag, leveling it in heavy bombardment. The invasion commenced 17 June, and Maryland provided fire support for the landing forces. The Japanese attempted to counter the battleships through the air. On 18 June, the ship's guns shot down their first Japanese aircraft, but on 22 June, a Mitsubishi G4M3 "Betty" medium bomber flew low over the still-contested Saipan hills and found Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Japanese plane dropped a torpedo, opening a large hole in Maryland s portside bow. The attack caused light casualties, and in 15 minutes she was underway for Eniwetok, and from there she steamed for the repair yards at Pearl Harbor,  escorted by two destroyers. Two men were killed in the attack. With an around-the-clock effort by the shipyard workers, Maryland was repaired in 34 days, departing on 13 August. She then embarked for the Solomon Islands with a large task force, anchoring in Purvis Bay off Florida Island for two weeks before steaming for the Palau Islands on 6 September.  She then joined Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Western Fire Support Group (Task Group 32.5; TG 32.5). Firing first on 12 September to cover minesweeping operations and underwater demolition teams at the opening of the battle of Peleliu, Maryland again conducted shore bombardment supporting the landing craft as they approached the beaches on 15 September.  Four days later, organized resistance collapsed, permitting the fire support ships to retire to the Admiralty Islands at the end of the month. Battle of Leyte GulfMaryland steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus where she was assigned to the 7th Fleet under Admiral Kincaid. The fleet sortied 12 October and Maryland joined Task Group 77.2, which was the gunfire and covering force for the invasion of Leyte.  She, along with four other battleships and numerous cruisers and destroyers, steamed into Leyte Gulf on the morning of 18 October. Maryland took position between Red and White Beaches and began bombarding them ahead of the invasion, which began at 10:00 20 October. Securing the beaches quickly, Maryland then took up a sentinel position in Leyte Gulf to guard the beaches against Japanese counterattack by sea. For the next several days, Japanese forces launched air raids to counter the incursion. These included the first widespread use of the kamikaze suicide attack. Several days later, U.S. submarines in the South China Sea spotted two Japanese forces on approach: five battleships steaming toward San Bernardino Strait, and another force of four Japanese carriers in northern Luzon. On 24 October, Maryland, California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia sailed to the southern end of Leyte Gulf to protect Surigao Strait with several cruisers, destroyers, and PT Boats. Early on 25 October, Japanese battleships   and  , with their screens, led the Japanese advance into the Strait.  At 03:55, the waiting Americans ships launched an ambush of the two Japanese battleships, pounding them with torpedoes and main guns. Torpedoes from the destroyers sunk Fusō.  Continued attacks by the task force also claimed Yamashiro. A few of the remaining Japanese ships then fled to the Mindanao Sea, pursued by Allied aircraft. Following the victory, Maryland patrolled the southern approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks.  On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland as she was covering  Denver. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turret No. 1 and Turret No. 2, piercing the forecastle, main, and armored decks and blowing a hole in the   steel, causing extensive damage and setting Maryland alight. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed. The battleship continued her patrols until relieved on 2 December, when she sailed with two heavily damaged destroyers for repairs.  She reached Pearl Harbor on 18 December, and was extensively repaired and refitted over the next several months. Battle of OkinawaAfter refresher training, Maryland headed for the western Pacific on 4 March 1945, arriving Ulithi on 16 March. There she joined the 5th Fleet and Rear Admiral Morton Deyo's Task Force 54 (TF 54), which was preparing for the invasion of Okinawa. The fleet departed on 21 March, bound for Okinawa. Maryland was assigned targets on the southern coast of Okinawa to support a diversionary landing, which would distract Japanese forces away from the main landing on the west coast.  Japanese forces responded with several air raids, with two of Marylands radar picket destroyers being struck by kamikaze planes, with Luce sinking. On 3 April, she was moved to the west coast invasion beaches to assist Minneapolis in destroying several shore batteries. Following the land invasion, she remained with the support force off Bolo Point providing artillery support for the invading troops. Maryland continued fire support duty until 7 April, when she steamed north to intercept a Japanese surface force with TF 54.  The Japanese ships, including the  , came under constant U.S. air attacks that day, and planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force sank six of the 10 ships in the force. At dusk, a kamikaze loaded with a   bomb crashed the top of Turret No. 3 from starboard. The explosion wiped out the 20 mm mounts and caused a large fire. The 20mm ammunition ignited from the heat, causing further casualties.  In all, 10 were killed, 37 injured and 6 missing following this attack. Maryland remained on station for the next week and continued her artillery support mission through several more air raids. Turret No. 3, damaged but usable, remained silent for the remainder of this mission. On 14 April, Maryland left the firing line at Okinawa and escorted several retiring transports. They steamed via the Mariana Islands and Guam to Pearl Harbor,  and she reached the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton on 7 May for extensive overhaul.  All of her 5 in guns were removed and replaced by sixteen 5 inch/38 cal guns in new twin mounts.  Turret No. 3 was repaired and the crew quarters were improved. She completed repairs in August, leaving for tests and training runs just as Japan surrendered, ending the war. She next entered Operation Magic Carpet fleet.  During the remaining months of 1945, Maryland made five voyages between the west coast and Pearl Harbor, returning more than 8,000 servicemen to the United States. Post-warArriving at Seattle, Washington on 17 December, Maryland completed her Operation Magic Carpet duty. She entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 15 April 1946, and was placed in commission in inactive reserve on 16 July.   She was decommissioned at Bremerton on 3 April 1947, and remained there as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Maryland was sold for scrapping to Learner Company of Oakland, California on 8 July 1959. On 2 June 1961, Governor of Maryland J. Millard Tawes, dedicated a monument to the memory of Maryland and her men. Built of granite and bronze and incorporating the bell of "Fighting Mary", this monument is located on the grounds of the State House in Annapolis, Maryland.

Sinepuxent, MarylandSinepuxent or Sinepuxent Town was a village in Worcester County, Maryland, located on Sinepuxent Neck across Sinepuxent Bay from the barrier island of Assateague.  The village was destroyed by a hurricane in 1818  and never rebuilt.  Its location arose in large part from its convenience to ocean-going ships: an inlet—Sinepuxent Inlet—allowed access through Assateague Island from the Atlantic Ocean to Sinepuxent Bay, until it was closed by the same hurricane that destroyed the village.Sinepuxent was the birthplace of U.S. Navy officer Stephen Decatur in 1779.References   
Harmony, MarylandHarmony is a small unincorporated community in Caroline County, Maryland, United States.  It is little more than an intersection of state Routes 16 and 578 on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Its original name was Fowling Creek named after a stream nearby that is a tributary of the Choptank River. There is a small country store with one gas pump, a church, a local produce stand, and lots of farmland.  While many of the farmers in the area are of German descent as can be seen in last names such as Kraus, Steenken, and Worm; they settled later after the civil war filling the void of the men lost in the war. The older families of Towers, Todd, and Wyddel were the original settlers that came from England in the early eighteenth century as can be confirmed from the original patents granted to them one of which is Wyddels Venture, the oldest century farm in the county.The soil is sandy and requires irrigation, unlike many farms in nearby Talbot County.  There are many cash crops grown such as sweet corn, cantaloupes, tomatoes, squash, etc...  There are quite a few migrant camps for Mexican workers who help with the crops in the summer.  Most farms also have chicken houses as a second means of income.References      
St. Mary's College of Maryland  St. Mary's College of Maryland, established in 1840, is an American public, secular liberal arts college located in St. Mary's City, Maryland. It is a member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges and designated as a Public Honors College (the only one in the state of Maryland and one of few around the U.S.). With about 2,000 enrolled students, the institution offers baccalaureate degrees in 22 disciplines, of which psychology, biology, and economics are among the most popular. It also offers one postgraduate degree, a Masters of Arts in Teaching.  The college shares much of its campus with Historic St. Mary's City, the fourth site of colonization in British North America and one of the premier archaeological sites on the East Coast. HistorySt. Mary's College of Maryland came into existence (on paper only) by an act of the Maryland State Board of Higher Education in 1966. The first bachelor’s (B.A.) degrees were awarded in 1971.The predecessor institution was St. Mary's Seminary Junior College (1949–1968), in turn preceded by St. Mary's Female Seminary Junior College (1927–1949). Both of these "junior colleges" combined the last two years of high school and the first two years of college, making it a four-year institution. After earning an associate's degree (A.A.) at St. Mary's girls would often continue studies at another university, where they would study for two more years and receive a B.A.The original St. Mary's Female Seminary was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1840. In 1840, the word "seminary" meant only that it was an academy or a high school, not a religious institution. St. Mary's was established by the legislature to be strictly non-denominational. It was a boarding school that included the elementary grades as well as grades 9-12, though education did not go beyond the 12th grade. Occasionally boys from the neighboring areas were allowed to take classes. The institution was named after St. Mary's City, the colonial site of Lord Baltimore's experiment in religious tolerance. The institution was built upon land that once had been inhabited by the colonists two hundred years before.For roughly the first 100 years (1840-1937) of its existence, the head of St. Mary's was called the "principal". When the school received accreditation as a junior college and included within the Maryland state budget in 1937, the term "principal" was changed to "president".  In 2010, Joseph Urgo became the institution's president.General information The campus borders the St. Mary's River.St. Mary's, although a state-operated institution, is independent of the University System of Maryland; it opted out of the system in 1992. However, in early 2006, St. Mary's joined the University of Maryland Academic Telecommunications System (UMATS), which interconnects the University System of Maryland with several other networks, including the Internet and Internet2 networks. St. Mary's mascot is the Seahawk, which is a nickname for the ospreys that can be found nesting in the near off-shore areas. The school colors are navy blue, yellow gold, and white. The Seahawks compete in NCAA Division III. St. Mary's athletics are recognized for the storied varsity baseball team and the nationally-ranked varsity sailing team.Green initiativesGoodpaster Hall, an academic building devoted to chemistry, psychology, and educational studies that opened in January 2008, was built to a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating of Silver. It is one of few "green" buildings in the state of Maryland. Other green initiatives include a student-supported green energy referendum, campus composting, and a geothermal system in the new River Center.Mission statement"Founded on the site of Maryland's first capital, the College stands as a living legacy to the ideals of freedom and inclusiveness. Our beautiful residential campus on the banks of the St. Mary's River inspires our work, our play, and our commitment to the environment."  Student dataAs of Fall 2008, the college had 2,035 students.57% of students are female, 43% male.17% of students are from out of state.96.36% of students attend full-time.76.36% of students are Caucasian, 8.11% are African-American, 4.47% are Hispanic, 3.88% are Asian, 0.69% are American Indian or Alaskan Native, 4.32% have undetermined ethnicity, and 2.16% are international. Thirty-seven countries are represented among the students.The student:faculty ratio in the Fall of 2008 was 11.66:1. Relationship with historic St. Mary's CitySt. Mary's College of Maryland and the historic St. Mary's City have a close relationship. Students are often hired to work within the historic site, and those who are not working are frequently found to be walking or biking along the miles of trail throughout Historic. Students may visit the historical site for free. The Maryland Heritage Project is an effort to bring together the college, historic St. Mary's City, Trinity Episcopal, a church located near the St. Mary's campus, and the wider community. Two new buildings, to be used jointly by the college and Historic St. Mary's City, are being built on campus. One of the buildings is a new interpretive center, which will showcase artifacts from St. Mary's City history – from the colony established in 1634, to the farmlands that replaced that colony in the 18th century, to the founding of the monument school in the mid-19th century, and beyond. The second building will be an academic building that will replace Anne Arundel Hall, a current St. Mary's academic building. This building will include Historic St. Mary's City's research offices, and faculty offices and classrooms for St. Mary's College in anthropology, democracy studies, history, international languages and cultures, and museum studies. It will host collection-based courses and summer institutes.

'Liberty of conscience' in religion, representative political practices, freedom of the press, and minority rights are a part of St. Mary's City's history. The Center focuses on an interdisciplinary understanding of early Maryland as an "emerging democracy," and applies the lessons of the region's history to a domestic and international discussion of democracy's role in the modern world. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) We the People initiative awarded the Center a $500,000 challenge grant in September 2004. The Center has until April 2008 to raise $1.5 million in private and non-federal funds to meet the matching requirements."

University System of Maryland  The University System of Maryland (USM) is a public corporation and charter school system comprising 12 Maryland institutions of higher education.  It is the 12th-largest university system in the United States, with over 125,000 undergraduate, 43,000 graduate and roughly 13,000 combined full-time and part-time faculty.  In 1988, it was created from the merger of the five University of Maryland institutions and the six members of the State University and College System of Maryland under the name University of Maryland System. In 1997, its name was changed to the University System of Maryland. In 1999, the Maryland General Assembly transformed the system to the charter model.   The system headquarters are in unincorporated Adelphi in Prince George's County. The merger creating the University of Maryland System was directed by Governor William Donald Schaefer and was overseen by University of Maryland President John S. Toll, who then became the system's first Chancellor.  The current Chancellor is William Kirwan.System membersUniversitiesBowie State UniversityCoppin State UniversityFrostburg State UniversitySalisbury UniversityTowson UniversityUniversity of BaltimoreUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore (The oldest campus in the system, founded in 1807)University of Maryland, Baltimore CountyUniversity of Maryland, College Park (the flagship campus)University of Maryland Eastern ShoreUniversity of Maryland University CollegeCenters and institutesUniversity of Maryland Center for Environmental ScienceSatellite campusesUniversities at Shady GroveUniversity System of Maryland at HagerstownRelationships with other schoolsWhen USM was originally formed in 1988, Maryland's other two state-funded (i.e., public) 4-year institutions (Baltimore's Morgan State University and Southern Maryland's St. Mary's College of Maryland) opted out of the system and made separate funding arrangements with the state.The Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, although state-supported, remained outside the system because of its unique status as an institution jointly funded by Maryland and Virginia.

Point of Rocks, MarylandPoint of Rocks is a community in Frederick County, Maryland.  It is named for the striking rock formation on the adjacent Catoctin Mountain, which were formed by the Potomac River cutting through the ridge in a water gap, a typical formation in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians.  The formation is not visible from the town and can only be seen from boats on the river, or from the southern bank of the river in Virginia.TransportationThe community contains the Point of Rocks Bridge of U.S. Route 15 over the Potomac River into Virginia.  The bridge is the first such crossing of the river upstream of the  American Legion Memorial Bridge on I-495 in Montgomery County. The only other crossing between them is White's Ferry.Point of Rocks is a passenger station stop on the MARC Brunswick Line. The station, designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin, was built by the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) Railroad and completed in 1876. Marking the junction between CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision (the current main line) and the Old Main Line Subdivision, it remains one of the former B&O's signature landmarks, and is a popular subject of railroad photography.HistoryIn 1828, the narrow passage between the rocks at this site provoked a violent legal battle between the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) Canal Company and the B&O Railroad over who could have control of the narrow pass.    After years of disputes, both companies finally compromised and allowed both canal and railroad to build on the right-of-way through the passage,  with a wall between the two to avoid trains scaring the mules that pulled the canal boats.During the American Civil War, the town was often raided by Confederate partisans, such as John S. Mosby, Elijah V. White and John Mobberly, operating in Loudoun County, Virginia.  The presence of the B&O railroad and C&O canal along with many exiled Unionists from Loudoun made the town such an attractive target.In 2001 Duke Energy filed an application with the Maryland Public Service Commission to construct a power plant on the north edge of town. In November 2002, however, Duke officially canceled its proposal, though it retains property in the area. The Point of Rocks Railroad Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and St. Paul's Episcopal Church was listed in 1978.   FloodingOlder portions of the town are on the Potomac River floodplain and have been repeatedly inundated.  An ongoing Federal Emergency Management Agency program to reduce flood insurance payouts has resulted in the purchase and demolition of a large portion of structures on the lowest-lying properties.Noted Residents and Natives Craig Davis, author and international development expertReferences See alsoLoudoun County in the American Civil WarExternal links Point of Rocks Community community website Catoctin Formation

Music of Maryland Maryland is a U.S. state with a musical heritage that dates back to the Native Americans of the region and includes contributions to colonial era music, modern American popular and folk music. The music of Maryland includes a number of popular musicians, folk styles and a documented music history that dates to the colonial archives on music from Annapolis, an important source in research on colonial music. Famous modern musicians from Maryland range from jazz singer Billie Holiday to pop punk band Good Charlotte, and include a wide array of popular styles.Modern Maryland is home to many well-regarded music venues, including the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Baltimore Opera, and the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music. Baltimore, the largest city in the state, is home to many important local venues, such as the Red Room, a center for the local experimental music scene, and the house nightspot Club Choices.   Outside of Baltimore, Frederick's Weinberg Center for the Arts and Rockville's Strathmore are also important regional venues. The Merriweather Post Pavilion and 1st Mariner Arena host most of the largest concerts in the area. Since HFStival ended its successful run in 2006, Virgin Festival has taken over as one of the most popular summer festivals on the east coast since its inaugural year in 2006.InstitutionsMost of the major musical organizations in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music. These include Baltimore Choral Arts and the Baltimore Opera, as well as the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO).   The founding of the Peabody in 1857 would dramatically change the musical life of Maryland. Nearly all of Baltimore's major musical organizations – the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Baltimore Opera, Baltimore Choral Arts, and a host of smaller organizations – owe their existence to Peabody musicians.  The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra formed in 1916 and was the only orchestra in the country to operate as a branch of the city's government.    In 1942, the orchestra was reorganized as a private institution. The Orchestra claims that Joseph Meyerhoff, President of the Orchestra beginning in 1965, and his music director, Sergiu Comissiona, began the modern history of the BSO and "ensured the creation of an institution, which has become the undisputed leader of the arts community throughout the State of Maryland".   Meyerhoff appointed Romanian-born conductor Sergiu Comissiona as music director; together, the visionary philanthropist and the charismatic conductor ensured the creation of an artistic institution, which has become the undisputed leader of the arts community throughout the State of Maryland. Aside from the prominent Baltimore Symphony, Maryland is also home to several other institutions. The Annapolis Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1962, is a well-known organization that has hosted guests like Cuban violinist Guillermo Perich and Charlie Byrd; the Annapolis Orchestra inspired composer David Ott to create the Annapolis Overture, which debuted in 1995.    The Rohrersville Cornet Band, part of Maryland's cornet band heritage, claims to be the oldest continually performing community band in the state, having been founded in 1837; it now performs in a dedicated music hall in Rohrersville.     The Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras (MCYO) was formed in the 1946 to "nurture, develop and advance young talented musicians in a quality orchestral program". Beginning in 1964, the Orchestras began to offer new programs, such as a summer camp that eventually became the Maryland Center for the Arts.   Venues and festivals The largest music venue in Maryland is the Merriweather Post Pavilion, opened in 1967 and designed by architect Frank Gehry to avoid disturbing as much as possible the surrounding Symphony Woods; it is an outdoor performance area, home to most of the largest concerts that come through the area.    In the 1990s and early 2000s, HFStival, held by the WHFS radio station, established itself as an extremely popular annual festival, and became a major draw across the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Since 2006, Virgin Festival has established itself as a hugely popular festival annually held at Pimlico Race Course, drawing in a variety of popular acts.    The Takoma Park Folk Festival is also well-known among folk music aficionados, and has been held annually since 1978 in Takoma Park, Maryland.   Baltimore is home to several important concert spaces, including the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Concordia Hall and the Lyric Opera House. The Meyerhoff is home to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Concordia Hall is a long-standing venue, founded in 1867 by German musical societies, which were then a large portion of Baltimore's population.  The Lyric Opera House, founded in 1894, is another important Baltimore music venue; it has hosted many of the most famous performers and public speakers to come to Baltimore.     Smaller Hardcore and Punk acts play at the Charm City Art Space.The city of Frederick is home to the Weinberg Centre for the Arts, which shows various kinds of theatrical and musical productions. The Weinberg was originally a large movie theater called the Tivoli, opened in 1926; the Tivoli was destroyed in a flood in 1976, and was reopened as the Weinberg Center two years later.    North Bethesda's Strathmore opened in 1976, and is now a home for numerous programs, including the largest of its music venues, the Music Center at Strathmore; the Strathmore has hosted well-known musicians and composers like the cellist Steven Honigberg, pianist Christopher Taylor, jazz singers Nnenna Freelon and Luciana Souza and composers Virgil Thomson and Gunther Schuller, as well as DC-area cult acts like the founder of Go-go, Chuck Brown, and the reunited punk band The Slickee Boys.   HistoryThe documented music history of Maryland begins during the colonial era, in the 18th century. Prior to that, Native Americans lived in the state, but left behind few traces of their musical life. The city of Annapolis was a major center for music during the colonial era; the city's Tuesday Club left behind documentation of musical life in Annapolis, one of the most complete sources for musical knowledge about that era in the United States. The larger city of Baltimore eventually replaced Annapolis as a center for music in Maryland, and eventually became home to most of the prominent music institutions in the state, especially the Peabody Institute. Later still, Baltimore's Pennsylvania Avenue became a very well known home for African American music, especially jazz, while Maryland began producing popular musicians like The Orioles. In modern times, Maryland has been a home for styles including emo and hardcore punk.Colonial eraThere is little historical record of music in Maryland prior to the 18th century; the Native Americans of the area left little or no trace of their musical life. A few instruments, such as drums and trumpets, are known to have existed in the early history of the Maryland colony, probably as a functional means "of calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military"; some folk dancing and ballad singing is also substantiated by the historical record. The early colonists had little tradition of any performance art, due to the small number of individuals, their low standard of living and great poverty and disease.   The few drums, trumpets, and other musical instruments recorded in seventeenth-century Maryland most likely played a functional role in calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military. A few references to ballad-singing and informal dancing pre-date 1700; there is no evidence of theatrical activities at this time. With the arrival of large numbers of slaves, however, some white plantation owners earned enough wealth to invest in music and dance. The upper class used instruments like the flute, violin and harpsichord and danced formal dances like the stately minuet or English country dance, while the lower classes preferred reels and jigs, accompanied by various kinds of guitars, drums, banjos, transverse flutes and recorders, as well as, more rarely, hammered dulcimers and harpsichords. Local music groups during the colonial era did much to sponsor musical development. Annapolis, a major center for colonial music in North America, was home to the Homony Club and the Tuesday Club, while the Freemasons held balls and concerts across Maryland. Unlike the northern United States, religious music did not prosper in Maryland until the end of the colonial period, and then only in Baltimore in the German communities of Carroll, Montgomery and Frederick countries.    Tavern owners frequently sponsored dances and concerts during the colonial era. Beginning in 1752, theater became a major part of Maryland culture for colonists of all classes; performances included light dance and incidental music, ballad operas and the works of William Shakespeare.  David K. Hildebrand and Elizabeth Schaaf date the first theatrical seasons in Maryland as 1752, 1760, and more regularly from 1769 to 1773  Aside from the cultural capital of Annapolis, the cities of Baltimore, Upper Marlboro and Chestertown were major homes for Maryland theater, home to the debuts of the latest and most popular dances. With the French and Indian War and then the American Revolution, soldiers brought back home to Maryland military band music, especially fife and drum ensembles. Early independence and 19th centuryProfessional theater in Maryland died out during the Revolution but was reestablished by 1780, now with Baltimore having replaced Annapolis as a cultural capital in the state.   Although the fear of war forced theater troupes to leave Maryland by 1774, theatrical activities resumed with renewed vigor in the early 1780s in Baltimore, the new state's post-Revolutionary cultural capital.  Maryland ratified the Constitution on April 28, 1788 and became the 7th state. The Holiday Street Theater in Baltimore opened in 1793 and was one of the first large theaters in the country, showcasing light theater, opera, and concerts. In 1822, Arthur Clifton from Baltimore debuted his opera The Enterprise, while religious music flourished after the 1821 opening of the Catholic Cathedral in the country. The African Methodist Episcopal churches in Maryland were home to singing traditions using the shape-note method. By the turn of the century, the middle classes of Maryland were holding regular dances featuring the cotillion, quadrille, schottische, polka and waltz. Eastern European dances were also popular, brought by immigrants from various countries. Many immigrants in Maryland moved to Baltimore, forming their own distinct neighborhoods with German liederkranz singing societies, and Irish St. Patrick's Day parades and Jewish chants flourished among their respective communities. Maryland was home to several folk traditions, including the work songs of rail and canal diggers and the crab- and oystermen of the Chesapeake Bay, whose repertoire varied from hymns to risqué songs and Bahaman shanties. By the middle of the 19th century, Baltimore was a major center of sheet music publishing, home to Joseph Carr, F. D. Benteen, John Cole and George Willig, as well as the piano-building businesses of William Knabe and Charles Stieff. This period also saw the rise of blackface minstrel shows, featuring the pseudo-African American songs of composers like Dan Emmett and Stephen Foster. During the Civil War, Maryland was a border state, home to people who sympathized with both sides of the conflict. Federal troops occupied Baltimore, and some people who wrote music that favored the Confederacy were jailed; these pieces included "The Confederacy March", "Stonewall Jackson's Way" and "Maryland, My Maryland", the last later becoming Maryland's state song. The Civil War left several lasting effects on American music nationwide, most importantly the normalization of white and black cultural mixing, especially in music, caused by the mixing of soldiers in multiracial units; military brass bands became a popular part of the music scene during and after the war, one of the first being the Moxley Band from Frederick. The middle of the 19th century saw a wave of immigration from Europe into the United States, including a large number of German musicians who settled in Baltimore; the presence of these musicians, as well as the general growth in urban population with the industrial revolution and the continued rise of the music publishing industry, helped make music training more affordable for more Americans. Conservatories, institutes of music education, were introduced to the United States in the mid to late 19th century, beginning with Baltimore's Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music, founded in 1857. The Peabody trained numerous musicians who went on to found most of Baltimore's major musical organizations, including the Baltimore Opera, Baltimore Choral Arts and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Though founded in 1857, the Peabody Institute did not hold an orchestral concert until after the Civil War, when James Monroe Deems directed a concert; Deems was a musician and composer, known for Nebuchadnezzar, one of the first American oratorios. He was succeeded by Lucien Southard, who failed to organize the Institute (then known as the Academy of Music), blaming the lack of a "proper musical atmosphere" in Baltimore. It was not until Asger Hamerik's reign that the Peabody Symphony Orchestra finally became successful, one of only five professional orchestras in the country at the time. Hamerik was an advocate of American music and regularly included the works of American composers, eschewing the more typical European programs. The Peabody during Hamerik's leadership produced such noted individuals as Otto Sutro, publisher, music store owner and host of a music society called the Wednesday Club, and with fellow Peabody alum Fritz Finke, founder of the Oratorio Society. In 1871, Ford's Grand Opera House opened, followed three years later by the Academy of Music; this new Academy of Music shared the name with the Peabody Institute's organization, but in the same year changed to the Conservatory of Music. The Academy's conductor, Adam Itzel, Jr. was a very popular composer, known for the national hit light opera The Tar and the Tartar. Early 20th centuryThere were a number of mostly informal musical societies in Maryland by the end of the 19th century, including the famous Saturday Night Club of H. L. Mencken and the influential Florestan Club, which hosted such musicians as Mischa Elman, Leopold Stokowski and Walter Damrosch. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra was the first permanent orchestra in the city since 1895, when the Peabody Orchestra dissolved; it opened in 1916 with conductor Gustav Strube; this came only three year's after the formation of the short-lived Baltimore Opera Society, which was eventually replaced by the Baltimore Opera in 1927. While the largely white middle- and upper-class Baltimoreans supported the orchestras and other societies, the city's African Americans formed their own Coloured Symphony Orchestra in 1931, which was municipally supported just like the BSO; the first performance included Ellis Larkins and Anne Brown, the latter known for creating the role of Bess in Porgy and Bess. At the time, Pennsylvania Avenue (often known simply as The Avenue) was the major scene for Baltimore's black musicians, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others.   Folk musicMaryland's folk music heritage remains little studied. There have been no major musicological studies in Maryland, though some Anglo-American and African American folk songs have been documented. The Library of Congress' American Folklife Center has a library of recorded Maryland folk music, which includes a wide array of songs and styles, including Bahamanian spirituals, Mexican music, African American blues, Appalachian folk music, steelpan and gospel music, and Piscataway Native American music.    Maryland's folk heritage also includes the traditional music of the German communities of central and western Maryland. Cornet bands, such as the Rohrersville Cornet Band, are also a prominent part of Maryland's folk heritage.The oystermen and others who work on the Chesapeake Bay have their own distinct folk song styles which include hymns and work songs. Some locally popular performers have used these folk themes in their music, including Bob Zentz and Steve Keith, all of whom have appeared on records by the Annapolis Maritime Museum's Chesapeake Music Institute. The Piedmont blues, a style of blues music, is most closely associated with the music of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina, but also exists in Maryland, which has produced modern performers like Warner Williams and Jay Summerour. Bill Jackson, born 1906, from Granite, Maryland was an obscure Piedmont blues guitarist and singer. He was discovered by Pete Welding and recorded his first and only record in 1962. The Piedmont blues arose from a mixture of black gospel music with white string ensembles, and is characterized by a style of guitar playing influenced by ragtime and country music.   Popular musicMaryland has produced popular musicians from many fields, including doo wop and hardcore punk, as well as the gangsta rap of Tupac Shakur, the contemporary R&B of Toni Braxton and the pop of Cass Elliott. Though doo wop can be traced to many urban areas across the United States, especially New York City, Sonny Til's 1946 band called The Vibranaires, later known as The Orioles, can be considered the first doo wop group.     The genre-crossing Frank Zappa was also from Maryland, as was Tupac Shakur, who was born in Harlem, though he began his career in Baltimore, eventually becoming one of the most famous rappers in hip hop history. Maryland has also produced many renowned jazz musicians, such as Eubie Blake, Elmer Snowden and Billie Holiday.  The Urbanite magazine describes Baltimore jazz as variously a wildly varying array of styles or a "hard bop town, where R&B, gospel and bebop meet"; The Urbanite The varying styles claim is cited to Andy Bienstock of WYPR, while the "hard bop town" is attributed to Benny Russell of the Maryland Conservatory of Music's Jazz Department  during the middle of the 20th century, Baltimore produced a vibrant local jazz tradition characterized by the use of the B3 organ. Many modern Baltimorean jazz musicians are renowned saxophonists, including Gary Thomas, Gary Bartz and the Afro-Caribbean influenced TK Blue. Internationally acclaimed jazz ensemble Fertile Ground lead by Baltimore native James H. Collins Jr. are also based in Baltimore. Famed Talking Heads lead singer David Byrne lived in Baltimore. Jimmie's Chicken Shack, Good Charlotte, All Time Low, and O.A.R. are other popular American rock bands with strong ties to Maryland.Mama Cass Elliot of The Mamas & the Papas was from Maryland, and began her singing career there. Another Maryland band similar to the Mamas and Papas, the Peppermint Rainbow, was discovered by Mama Cass and had a top forty hit with the song "Will you be staying after Sunday". Maryland-based band The Ravyns are also notable for having their song "Raised on the Radio" appear on the soundtrack to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The Dundalk-based Chorus of the Chesapeake won international championships in 1961 and 1971.Baltimore's hardcore punk scene has been overshadowed by DC's, but included locally renowned bands like Law & Order, Bollocks, OTR, and Fear of God; many of these bands played at bars like the Marble Bar, Terminal 406 and the illegal space Jule's Loft, which author Steven Blush described as the "apex of the Baltimore (hardcore) scene" in 1983 and 1984. The 1980s also saw the development of a local New Wave scene led by the bands Ebeneezer & the Bludgeons, Null Set, and Here Today (later Vigil (band)). Later in the decade, emo bands like Reptile House and Grey March had some success and recorded with Ian MacKaye in DC.     Some early Baltimore punk musicians moved onto other local bands by the end of the 1990s, resulting in local mainstays Lungfish and Fascist Fascist, who became regionally prominent.  The Urbanite magazine has identified several major trends in local Baltimorean music, including the rise of psychedelic-folk singer-songwriters like Entrance and the house/hip hop dance fusion called Baltimore club, pioneered by DJs like Rod Lee. More recently, Baltimore's indie rock scene has produced performers like Slot Racer, Cass McCombs and Mary Prankster.   Maryland has had a thriving doom metal scene since the early 90s, and is now considered to have its own "Maryland doom" sound.  This scene was started in the late 70s with The Obsessed, a band led by Scott "Wino" Weinrich. During this time, Northern Virginia's Pentagram also had a heavy influence on the Maryland scene. After disbanding The Obsessed in the mid 80s and moving to California to sing with doom legends Saint Vitus, Wino reformed The Obsessed and signed to the German based Hellhound Records. With The Obsessed on board, Hellhound began to sign other Maryland bands, such as Wretched, Iron Man, Unorthodox, Internal Void, and Revelation (who already had an album on Rise Above Records). After Hellhound's demise in the late 90s, many Maryland doom bands were picked up by various other labels, including Southern Lord Records. After The Obsessed second break up, Wino formed Spirit Caravan and The Hidden Hand. Both have been very successful in the doom genre. Other current Maryland doom bands include Earthride, Nitroseed, and Black Manta.80's metal band, Kix are from Hagerstown. Death metal band Dying Fetus are from Upper Marlboro. Heavy Metal band Incision are from Maryland. Progressive metal band Periphery are from Bethesda.The annual Maryland Deathfest has become a popular festival for extreme music.Maryland has a thriving experimental music scene, based around Baltimore. The local scene is led by artists and groups such as Dan Deacon, Double Dagger and North Carolina imports Future Islands. Famed group Animal Collective had their beginnings in the suburbs surrounding Baltimore, and named their breakout 2009 album Merriweather Post Pavilion after the famed Pavilion in Columbia.See alsoMusic of the Mid-Atlantic United StatesReferences and notes   
Maryland, London  Maryland is a location in east London.  It forms the northeastern part of Stratford in the London Borough of Newham.  The area borders Leytonstone to the north, Stratford New Town to the west and Forest Gate to the east, with the centre of Stratford to the south-west.HistoryMaryland's earliest known recorded appearance is on a map of Essex published by J. Oliver in 1696, where it is marked as 'Maryland Point'.  The name originated with a rich local merchant who bought land and built in the area having returned from the American colony of Maryland.  London's Maryland is therefore an unusual example of a place in Britain named after an American location, rather than vice versa.Various attempts have been made to identify the merchant.  The most likely candidate seems to be Richard Lee  (d. 1664), who emigrated to Virginia around 1640.  His estate there included land on the Maryland side of the Potomac River, near a place known as Maryland Point (later to be the site of the Maryland Point Light).  On returning to England in 1658, Lee bought land in Stratford, and in 1662 was recorded as owning a large house there.Notable people associated with MarylandCharles Edmund Clutterbuck, stained glass artistDorothy Kilner (1755–1836), children's writerAnna Kingsford, anti-vivisectionist, theosophist, suffragette and campaigner for women's rights, née Bonus, born Maryland Point 1846Tempa T, Grime artist and creator of underground hit "Next Hype"TransportMaryland Station is served by trains operated by Greater Anglia, with a frequency of approximately 10 minutes in each direction.  Trains towards central London stop at Stratford before terminating at Liverpool Street station, with a journey time of just 10 minutes.  To the East, trains run a stopping service terminating at Shenfield.  Maryland Station will be served by Crossrail trains when that project is completed.Maryland is served by bus routes 69 (24hr), 257, 308, and night bus N8.RegenerationMany small and ongoing redevelopment programmes are linked to the opening of the Stratford International station on High Speed 1, the 2012 Olympic Games, and the Stratford City complex, all of which are adjacent to Maryland.EducationFor details of education in Maryland see the List of schools in the London Borough of NewhamReferences

Maryland Transit Administration  The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated mass transit administration in Maryland, and is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is better known as MTA Maryland to avoid confusion with other cities' transit agencies who share the initials MTA. The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. There are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car,  the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture. The system has many connections to other transit agencies of Central Maryland: WMATA, Charm City Circulator, Howard Transit, Connect-A-Ride, Annapolis Transit, Rabbit Transit, Ride-On, and  TransIT.History The MTA took over the operations of the old Baltimore Transit Company on April 30, 1970.    It was originally known as the Baltimore Metropolitan Transit Authority, then the Mass Transit Administration before it changed to its current name in October 2001. Many of the routes of most of the agency's current bus lines are based on the original streetcars operated by the Baltimore Transit Company and its parent companies from the 1890s to the 1960s. All these routes were ultimately converted to rubber tire bus operations, and many of them were consolidated, extended into newly developed areas, or otherwise reconfigured to keep up with the ridership demands of the times.  Additional routes and extensions were added in later years to serve communities that were later developed, and to feed into Metro and Light Rail stations that were later built.With the growth in popularity of the private automobile during the 20th century, streetcar and bus ridership declined, and the needs for public transportation changed. Mass transit in Baltimore and other cities shifted from a corporate operation to a tax-subsidized state-run service. The amount of service provided was greatly reduced, and some areas once served by streetcars are currently served by buses very minimally or not at all. The demise of the Baltimore streetcar took place between the years of 1947 and 1963, as operators found buses to be low maintenance and more cost-efficient. As rails were demolished, Baltimore was no longer a streetcar city.  As transit needs and trends changed, rail transit did return to the city, with the Metro Subway opening in 1983 and the Light Rail in 1992. Bus services Bus services operate throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and other parts of the state. These include local bus routes which serve areas of Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Anne Arundel County. Neighborhood shuttle service operating in specific Baltimore City areas, mainly in the northwest region. QuickBus operates limited-stop service throughout the city. Commuter, express, and intercounty connector bus routes operate within other parts of the state usually via highways or Interstate.Local busLocal bus lines are identified by a one- or two-digit number. There are currently forty-five local bus routes throughout the urban and suburban area of Baltimore City numbered 1 through 99. Bus Routes. MTA Maryland. Retrieved 2010-08-30 QuickbusThe MTA currently operates four limited-stop routes known as Quickbus or qb, which are designated as routes qb40, qb46, qb47, and qb48. Neighborhood Shuttle BugThe MTA has two neighborhood shuttle routes: The Mondawmin Shuttle Bug Route 97 and the Hampden Shuttle Bug Route 98. These routes can be identified by their distinctive brand colors and logosExpress busThe MTA operates four express bus lines in the Baltimore area, which are the 104, 120, 150, and 160. Commuter busIndependent bus companies operate 21 commuter bus routes in the Washington D.C and Baltimore regions. There are five Baltimore-bound bus lines numbered in the 300 and 400 range; while the sixteen Washington-bound bus lines are numbered in the 900 range.  These routes range from 310 through 995.Intercounty Connector busBuses travelling on MD 200 are numbered in the 200 range. Five routes ranging 201 through 205. Rail servicesHeavy rail (Metro Subway) This system operates elevated and underground from a corporate and shopping complex in Owings Mills in Baltimore County into the heart of Downtown Baltimore City's business, shopping and sightseeing districts to the world-renowned Johns Hopkins Medical Center Complex. The   northwest-southeastbound route includes 14 station stops.  Its route through the densest parts of the city is underground, from Hopkins Hospital to a portal west of Mondawmin station, where it immediately rises to an elevated concrete right of way parallel to Wabash Avenue practically at the city line.Entering Baltimore County, the line goes to surface, passing through and virtually dividing communities along the way to commuter based stops at Milford Mill Road (Pikesville) and Old Court Road (Pikesville). From Old Court, the tracks pass underneath the I-695/795 interchange, and travel the median of 795 till their end at Owings Mills (Painter's Mill Road) This station is the centerpiece of a huge project intending to urbanize that immediate area, with a Baltimore County Public Library branch, and classroom space for the Community College of Baltimore County under construction.  Residential and commercial development is planned to follow the completion of the education buildings.There are efforts underway to extend the line northeast through the city with phase 1 to Morgan State University and phase 2 beyond the city limits to the White Marsh Town Center area. If they come to fruit, the line will be renamed the Green Line, coordinating with the new Red Line (east-west Woodlawn/Security-Hopkins Bayview Hospital) in its preliminary engineering stage. Funding for the Green Line extension is still years from being secured but includes an option to extend it as light rail or BRT from Johns Hopkins Hospital.Light rail This service travels from a corporate, hotel, and shopping complex in Baltimore County’s Hunt Valley, through the suburbs north of Baltimore and northern Baltimore City and into the heart of downtown Baltimore's shopping, sightseeing, dining, and entertainment districts, past the harbor and through southern Baltimore City and finally to BWI Marshall Airport and Cromwell Station/Glen Burnie in Anne Arundel County. There is also a spur to Amtrak’s Baltimore Penn Station.The Light Rail operates at grade for the most part, though it travels on bridges crossing several bodies of water. There are 33 station stops along the   system. Although much of the line was single-tracked when it was built, the MTA completed a double-tracking project on February 26, 2006,  and now only a few short single-track sections remain.Commuter rail (MARC) This service operates three lines that provide commuter rail service to riders out of and into Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Frederick, Perryville, and Martinsburg, WV, as well as several other locations in between.Mobility servicesParatransitThe MTA began offering paratransit service for persons with disabilities in 1978 when it took over a mobility service in Baltimore previously operated by Lutheran Family Services.  This mobility service is a "non-fixed route" service and consists of a fleet of specially converted Ford E-Series vans and Ford Crown Victorias. Some service is contracted out to MV Transportation and Veolia Transportation, but all vehicles are owned by MTA.Taxi AccessA sub-service of the Paratransit program is MTA's Taxi Access program, designed with technology made by a company called MJM Management. The Taxi Access program ensures that any sufficiently physically disabled person that consistently requires Paratransit service can also qualify for the Taxi Access program. The Taxi Access program allows the bearer of a Taxi Access card to take a taxicab door-to-door within the limits of anywhere MTA Paratransit vans go; i.e. within 1/3 of a mile of an MTA public transit stop of any kind. Once the trip is complete, total out-of-pocket cost for the customer is $3.00, and the MTA picks up the rest of the price of the fare, "paying" it to the driver in the form of a voucher that s/he later redeems at his/her cab company headquarters. Proposed servicesCurrently the MTA is studying a number of proposed services, which includes the Red Line (a proposed east–west light rail line that would pass from Woodlawn pass near Patterson Park) to Johns Hopkins Bayview Med. Ctr. and the Green Line (a proposed north–south line that would extend from the Johns Hopkins Hospital into northeast Baltimore, possibly as an extension of the Metro Subway). As of summer 2011, the Red Line has received federal permission to enter preliminary engineering.  Efforts to fund both lines continue, with overall priority going to the Red Line as of now.Outside of Baltimore the MTA is also studying the Purple Line between Bethesda and New Carrollton, and the Corridor Cities Transitway between Gaithersburg and Clarksburg. Both studies are evaluating bus rapid transit and light rail options.FaresThese are the current fare prices for MTA buses, Light Rail, and Metro Subway travel.  There is a separate fare structure for MARC Train services.

ParatransitType Cost (USD) One-Way $1.85  Note: People who qualify for paratransit services can use all MTA rail and bus services free of charge.Fare collection methodsPrior to the summer of 2005, the MTA used an older fare collection system. Day passes purchased on buses were printed out by a separate machine from the bus fareboxes. It was possible to alter these passes so that they could used on other days and to sell them to other passengers ot make duplicate passes and sell them to others for cheaper than the MTA's official fares. This was despite the fact that they were officially non-transferable.The MTA has since installed new fareboxes on all of its buses that issue daily passes with magnetic strips; new ticket vending machines at Light Rail and Metro Subway stations issue identical passes including the weekly and monthly passes. Weekly and monthly passes are not sold on buses. The newer day passes can be used only on the appropriate day because the machine encodes the date and expiration time in the magnetic strip, which is read when swiped through the magnetic reader. Swiping the pass also sets a time waiting period on reuse so the pass cannot be immediately handed to a different passenger and used for free boarding. This also makes it difficult for passengers to use counterfeit passes when boarding the bus, Light Rail, and Metro Subway.The MTA continues to struggle with passengers who purchase day passes, use them, then resell them at a direct loss to the agency. State employees who possess a Maryland State Employee ID card can ride MTA local bus, Light Rail, and the Metro Subway free of charge. Any state employee with the ID card can get a continuation ticket to get through the gates on the Metro Subway. For the bus, the person shows the state employee ID card to the driver when boarding. On the Light Rail, they have to show the ID card only in the event of a fare inspection while other passengers show their tickets. MTA employees can also ride free of charge if they carry their MTA employee ID card. The MARC train service is preparing for the eventual integration with the regional SmarTrip smartcard-based fare system.  The system will involve conductors using hand-held units to validate SmarTrip cards as well as the MTA's Maryland Transit Pass.Maryland transit pass The MTA plans to begin selling smart cards under the name CharmCard.  These will be similar to, and compatible with, the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority's regional smart card system, the SmarTrip card. When the CharmCard system is fully implemented, it will be used not only on Maryland Transit Administration transit services, but will also be able to be used in Washington D.C. on all WMATA buses, the Washington Metro and on most local bus services in Northern Virginia. Likewise, the WMATA SmarTrip card will be accepted by the fareboxes used by the MTA. Special programsBaltimore City Public School SystemAn agreement between the Baltimore City Public School System and the Maryland Transit Administration provides eligible BCPSS students (usually students who live outside a predetermined area surrounding the school) during a school year with a color-coded booklet of dated tickets each month and an identification card. The tickets allow students to ride on MTA buses, light rail, and subway free going to and from school.  The farebox is able to issue magnetic transfers to ticket holders who must use more than one bus.  They're valid for 90 minutes of unlimited travel at the driver's discretion. MTA college passThe Maryland Transit Administration has a special program set up with 24 Baltimore area colleges and universities which allows college students who are enrolled in a minimum of 6 hours per week can receive a monthly pass for $39.00.

In addition to the enumerated rules of behavior, Section 7-705 also allows the MTA to enforce local government laws on public transit vehicles. Many of these rules are conspicuously posted on transit vehicles, bus stops and rail platforms.References External linksOfficial MTA site (Mobile)What is the CharmCard site Taxi Access II trip planner for Taxi Access program.

University of Maryland, Baltimore County   The University of Maryland, Baltimore County   (often referred to as UMBC) is an American public research university, located in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, mostly in the community of Catonsville. Established as a part of the University System of Maryland in 1966, the university specializes in the natural sciences and engineering, while also offering programs in the liberal arts.   Academics UMBC offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a variety of areas of study.  There are 54 majors, 42 minors and 20 certificate offerings in its undergraduate program.  UMBC's Graduate School offers 33 master's degree programs, 23 doctoral degree programs and 20 graduate certificate programs.  The university is divided into three colleges, two schools, as well as its graduate school.CollegesThe College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences includes the Departments of  Biological Sciences, Communication, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, and Physics.  It also home to the new Department of Marine Biotechnology. The College of Engineering and Information Technology offers different areas of study in five departments: the Departments of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Information Systems, and Mechanical Engineering. The College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences houses the most departments in the university and awards more than half of all undergraduate and graduate degrees.   Among many others, it includes the departments of Ancient Studies, History, Music, Political Science, Sociology, and Visual Arts.  Many of the departments will be soon housed in the new Performing Arts and Humanities Building.  Groundbreaking  and a grand opening ceremony for the Performing Arts building was held on September 19, 2012. SchoolsThe Erickson School of Aging offers undergraduate and graduate level programs that focuses on various aspects of aging studies, including policy and management issues.The School of Social Work links with the University of Maryland, Baltimore's (UMB) School of Social work in offering undergraduate and graduate level programs.GPAThe average cumulative GPA of all undergraduates in the Spring 2009 semester was 2.8 CampusLocationUMBC's campus is located on 500 acres.  It is 15 minutes from Baltimore's Inner Harbor and 45 minutes from Washington, D.C. Baltimore Washington International Airport is five minutes away, as are AMTRAK and light rail stations.  UMBC, three miles outside the Baltimore city limits, successfully lobbied the government to use 'Baltimore' as its address.  While its suburban campus has minimal interaction with its surroundings, students variously consider it to be located in the towns of Catonsville (by CDP) or Arbutus (whose street grid it borders). The campus is undercut by a series of tunnels, which are underground, where tunnels usually are.Research and Technology ParkUMBC Research and Technology Park is a 71 acre development on the campus hosting technology, bioscience and research organizations, many of which are engaged in partnership with the University.     Research Park tenants include the US Geological Survey, US Forestry Service, CardioMed Device Consultants, Audacious Inquiry, Med-IQ, Physician Practice, Inc., Retirement Living TV, Ascentium Corporation, Solvern Innovations, RMF Engineering, Inc., Convergent Technology, Clear Resolution Consulting, Fearless Solutions, and Goddard Earth Science and Technology Center.Campus policeUMBC maintains a 24-hour police staff of sworn officers, supplemented by non-sworn security officers and student marshals.  Unlike the campus police of the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the campus police are not accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.    Accreditation is expected by the University System of Maryland mandated 2013 deadline.   The UMBC police logs all crime reports and statistics as required by law on the UMBC Police Webpage. Student life The Resident Student Association and Student Events Board provide social programming during all academic semesters at UMBC. Over 200 student-run organizations exist on campus. There are many squirrels on campus who are not afraid of people.LLC (Language Literacy & Culture)This unique interdisciplinary doctoral program draws upon faculty from disciplines in the humanities and social sciences from eight departments and programs at UMBC: Africana Studies; American Studies; Education; English; History; Gender and Women's Studies; Modern Languages, Linguistics and Intercultural Communication;	and Sociology and Anthropology. Greek LifeUMBC has 23 officially registered sororities and fraternities with nearly 5% of UMBC's undergraduate students belonging to one of them. Residential lifeThere are ten housing areas housing approximately 3,900 students, which are: Potomac Hall, Chesapeake Hall, Erickson Hall, Harbor Hall, Patapsco Hall, Susquehanna Hall, Hillside Apartments, Terrace Apartments, Walker Avenue Apartments, West Hill Apartments.    Shared rooms (usually two students per room)  Shared bathrooms (usually four students per bathroom/two rooms per bathroom)  Includes basic furniture (bed, desk, chair, closet), Internet access (Ethernet), a telephone, and access to cable television  Special activities and events every week in the dormitories  Potomac Hall is open all year, including holiday breaks (called "continuous occupancy"). Most international students prefer Potomac Hall because it is always open. (The other dormitories close during Thanksgiving, winter, and spring breaks.)     ChessUMBC has won the Pan American Chess Tournament 9 times in 13 years (1996–2009).  The school provides substantial chess scholarships to outstanding high school graduate players at the International or Grandmaster level.  Former UMBC team captain GM Alexander Onischuk has gone on to become US Champion in 2006.   Professor of Computer Science Alan Sherman has been instrumental in building up the UMBC chess dynasty by recruiting players from around the world.Athletics The school's sports teams are called the Retrievers, with colors black and gold. The mascot of the University is the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, the state dog of Maryland, named True Grit. There is a statue of True Grit that stands in front of the Retriever Activities Center (RAC). The Retrievers participate in NCAA Division 1 as a part of the America East Conference, fielding 17 varsity sports; eight men and nine women. The Retrievers fight song is the UMBC Riser, and was written by Dr. George LaNoue, a professor of policy sciences.In 2009, the men's lacrosse team secured their fifth consecutive outright or shared America East regular season championship and their third America East tournament championship in four years. UMBC has secured a berth in the NCAA tournament each of the past four seasons.  All-Time Records (PDF), 2009 UMBC Retrievers Men's Lacrosse Media Guide, p. 41–50, UMBC, 2009.  In 2007, the unseeded Retrievers upset seventh-seeded Maryland, 13–9, in the NCAA tournament to advance to the Division I second round for the first, and so far only, time in school history. The Retrievers won their first regular season American East Men's Basketball title in 2007-08, and also qualified for their first NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. They had previously competed in the Division II men's basketball tournament.The Retrievers Men's Soccer Team won the America East Conference in 2010 receiving an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I men's soccer tournament. The Retrievers won their first round game against Princeton but lost in the second round in a shootout to a ranked William and Mary team. This is the best UMBC has ever done at the tournament. Star striker, Levi Houapeu, from that 2010 team was drafted as a 5th pick in the 3rd round of the 2011 MLS Superdraft by the Philadelphia Union. He is the first UMBC player to be drafted into the MLS.  The men also won the conference again in 2012, and advanced to the NCAA tournament once again.  They won their first round game against Old Dominion, but lost in penalty kicks in the second round to defending champion, UNC Chapel Hill.The Retrievers, Men's Swimming and Diving Program captured their 13th straight conference championship in the 2009-2010 Season.  Since Joining the America East Conference in 2004, the Retriever Men have not lost their crown.Retrievers Basketball games are broadcast by Paul Mittermeier and Gary Stein as well as Troy Greene and Dan Levin.In 2010, a contest was launched to find a new logo for Athletics.  In May 2010, the UMBC Athletic Department unveiled a new logo for the Retrievers created by Jim Lord.Financial aid and scholarshipsThe Meyerhoff Scholarship Program at UMBC is a program focused on the cultivation of underrepresented minority scholarship and awareness in the math, science, and engineering disciplines. Other scholarship programs include the CWIT Scholars Program, the Humanities Scholars Program, the Linehan Artist Scholars Program, the Sondheim Public Affairs Scholars Program and the Sherman Teacher Education Scholars Program.Rankings   UMBC rankings   font-size:larger; ">     USNWR National University   157         USNWR Up-and-Coming Schools     1      USNWR Public Universities   83     USNWR High School Counselor   147     USNWR Undergraduate Teaching   4     USNWR Engineering   118     USNWR Computer Science   72     USNWR Public Affairs   67     USNWR Mathematics     98     USNWR Physics   122     USNWR Psychology   117     USNWR Chemistry   107 The University is ranked 160th in the latest 2013 U.S. News and World Report rankings of "National Universities" across the United States, and it is ranked 87th nationally among public universities.UMBC ranks fourth among U.S. research universities in the production of IT degrees and certificates, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

The Carnegie Foundation classifies UMBC as a research university with high research activity.  UMBC is one of 50 public institutions in the United States recognized by The Princeton Review as a “Best Value College” offering a combination of educational excellence and affordability.The honor is the third major national distinction UMBC has received from leading higher-education rankings publications this academic year. For the second year in a row, UMBC was named America’s #1 “Up-and-Coming” national university by U.S. News and World Report.The Princeton Review recognizes UMBC, a research university with nearly 13,000 students, for attracting serious students and supporting them with undergraduate research opportunities throughout the Baltimore-Washington region and beyond. The campus location near BWI-Marshall Airport gives students access to internships with government agencies, nonprofits and leading private-sector companies. Approximately 77 percent of students at UMBC receive some financial aid in the form of scholarships, loans and grants.UMBC has earned an honorable mention on The Princeton Review’s recently released list: “Top Schools to Study Video Game Design for 2012.” The recognition places UMBC among schools like Georgia Institute of Technology, UC Santa Cruz, and Northeastern University.Released annually, the list features 50 schools from around the country, including their “top ten” undergraduate and graduate schools in this category. The rankings were based on a survey administered by The Princeton Review during the 2011-2012 academic year that consulted administrators at 150 schools and universities. The winning schools were judged on the quality of their curriculum, faculty, facilities, and infrastructure, as well as their scholarship, financial aid, and career opportunities.Both UMBC’s Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department and its Visual Arts Department offer programs for students interested in pursuing a career in video game development. Artists can concentrate on “Animation and Interactive Media,” while computer programmers can pursue the “Game Development” track within the Computer Science major. In addition, UMBC has a Game Development club, and has been a host site of the International Development Association’s Global Game Jam for the past four years.

Seabrook, Maryland Seabrook is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George's County, Maryland, about   east of Washington, D.C.  As of the 2010 census, the population of the CDP was 17,287.    Prior to 2010, Seabrook was part of the Lanham-Seabrook census-designated place. HistorySeabrook takes its name from Thomas Seabrook, who was a topographical engineer with the Pennsylvania Railroad. He originally built three cottages and a park with fenced-in tame deer in the area near the rail station  in the early 1870s. A school was built in 1895.The community developed in direct relationship with the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. The railroad's main branch into Washington opened in July 1872, with stations established at Glenn Dale, Seabrook, and Lanham, among others.  Thomas Seabrook, an engineer for the railroad, purchased   of land in 1871 around the location of a planned station for the purpose of creating a retreat community. By 1880, a station building and three Gothic cottages had been built, followed by commercial buildings and a schoolhouse. By 1914, the community remained small with just a few buildings located at the intersection of Seabrook Road with the railroad. By 1957, the community had grown to include approximately 185 houses along 10 streets. The streets were arranged in a grid pattern roughly parallel to the railroad line. The community extended from present-day Good Luck Road south to Annapolis Road.Residential development continued on vacant lots within the community throughout the 20th century, while commercial development focused along the main roads. Commercial strip development is located along Annapolis Road and Lanham-Severn Road. The original railroad station and early commercial buildings are no longer extant, though the old schoolhouse and a few of the early dwellings survive.    Most of the more recently built Seabrook (some of which was originally called Seabrook Acres) is a development of red brick homes along the Lanham-Severn Road, now Maryland Route 564 in Maryland, approximately one half mile east of the Capital Beltway. Many of its homes were built in the 1950s to serve the needs of new employees at the newly established NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which is located immediately to the north.  Development of apartment complexes and other large structures has occurred during recent years of developer expansion. However, Seabrook remains a residential area with numerous single homes surrounded by green lawns shaded by century old oak trees.GeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Seabrook census-designated place has a total area of  , all land. BusinessesSeabrook has its own MARC commuter rail station (Seabrook Station). Seabrook residents are served by a large number of small businesses, including restaurants, fast foot eateries, banks, lawyer services, laundry services, veterinary services, car repair, and numerous other businesses which are located at the Seabrook Station. Seabrook shoppers also tend to shop at the supermarkets and stores at Glenn Dale, slightly to the east on Route 564, or drive east approximately   to Bowie, with its large shopping complexes such as the Bowie Towne Centre.Lanham-SeabrookLanham, Maryland, an older community, lies to the west on both sides of the Washington Beltway. Within the Lanham-Seabrook area, there is only one post office (20706), located a half mile east of Seabrook Station on route 564, which both towns must share. As a result, since the post office has been designated "Lanham", all mail to both the Seabrook and Lanham area is town-designated as "Lanham" or "Lanham-Seabrook."References   
St. Mary's City, Maryland St. Mary's City, in St. Mary's County, Maryland, is a small unincorporated community near the southernmost end of the state on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  It is located on the eastern shore of the St. Mary's River, a tributary of the Potomac. St. Mary's City is the fourth oldest permanent settlement in British North America.  It is considered the birthplace of religious tolerance in the United States, as the colony passed the Maryland Toleration Act (1649). Until 1695 St Mary's City was the capital of the Province of Maryland.A section of the community, Historic St. Mary's City, was declared a National Historic Landmark on August 4, 1969.    and    Note: A National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination document should be available upon request from the National Park Service for this site, but it appears not to be available on-line from the NPS Focus search site. HistoryBeginningsSt. Mary's City was founded in 1634 by a group of English settlers. They arrived on the ships Dove and Ark.  Leonard Calvert, a Roman Catholic and younger brother of Cecilius Calvert, the 2nd Baron Baltimore, led the group of settlers.  Originally land in the colony was given to their father George Calvert by King Charles I, but the senior Calvert died before the claim was established. The original St. Mary's was laid out according to a Baroque town plan, but most residents of St. Mary's City preferred to live on their tobacco plantations in the surrounding countryside. The settlement was meant to be the capital of the new Maryland Colony. A Yaocomico village had formerly occupied the location, but the Tayac Kittimundiq, paramount chief of the Piscataway nation, ordered the village cleared and gave it to the English newcomers.  He wanted to develop them as allies and trading partners.  For some time, the Piscataway, their tributary tribes, and the English coexisted peacefully.ExpansionIn the second half of the 17th century, St. Mary's City had an economic boom due to successful tobacco farming, which was the most important export commodity.  An increasing town population contributed to the desire for constructing public buildings, some of which were a state house, a Jesuit chapel, a jail, and an inn. During and after the English Civil War, fights between Protestants and Catholics developed in the colonies as well. About forty years later, in 1689, the religious tensions became so great that Protestant settlers revolted against the Lords Baltimore. The English Crown took over the Maryland colony and appointed royal governors.DeclineMaryland governor Sir Francis Nicholson relocated the capital from St. Mary's to the more central Annapolis in 1695.  The colonial statehouse in St. Mary's was turned into a Protestant church the same year.With the seat of government gone, the town lost its reason to exist.  Remaining inhabitants were mostly farmers. The former town center was converted to agricultural land, and archaeological remains from the colonial town were undisturbed in the ground. The smaller farms were consolidated into a large plantation by the Brome-Howard family, which operated through the 19th century.  Much of the historic area remained under a single property owner well into the 20th century. By the mid-20th century, few 17th-century buildings still stood.  The town center site appeared to be farmland with a few private residences, and an expanding school that would become St. Mary's College of Maryland.PresentPresent-day St. Mary's City is primarily the location of St. Mary's College and the Historic St. Mary's City museums. The museum complex is staffed by archaeologists.  It includes a visitor center/museum building, outdoor living history exhibits, reconstructed colonial buildings, the St. John's site museum, and a working 17th-century-style farm. This complex, developed to interpret the site for visitors, was created after Historic St. Mary's was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1969.   and    Archaeological historySt. Mary's City is known for its archaeological sites. After explorations by Henry Chandlee Forman in the 1940s, excavations began in 1971  with the creation of the Historic St. Mary's City Commission. The Commission was a state institution tasked with preserving the archaeological remains, establishing a museum on the site, and conducting archaeological research. Since then, much of the old city has been found. Historic St. Mary's City continues to excavate areas of the town today.Some important discoveries include:A 1645 fort with a surrounding moat, claimed to be the only structural remains of the English Civil War in the American Colonies. Façon de Venise glassware;A set of Kutahya ceramics, one of only two known examples found in the United States; Three 17th-century lead coffins;The foundation of a Jesuit chapel;A quantity of lead type, indicating that the site where it was found was the documented William Nuthead Printing House.

Glassmanor, Maryland Glassmanor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Prince George's County, Maryland, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 17,295.    Prior to 2010, the United States Census Bureau had placed Glassmanor and the adjacent community of Oxon Hill in the "Oxon Hill-Glassmanor" census-designated place for statistical purposes.The original Glassmanor apartments were built about 1950 by the Glassman company just outside the border of southeast Washington, D.C.  In the mid-1950s the Eastover shopping center was built across the highway, followed by other adjoining apartment projects in the 1960s. U.S. Senator George McGovern, who was the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in 1972, lived briefly in Glassmanor while a freshman congressman   The area has undergone tremendous demographic and social changes since that time.GeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Glassmanor has a total area of  , all of it land.  The CDP is bordered by Washington, D.C. to the northwest, the town of Forest Heights to the west, Oxon Hill to the south, Temple Hills to the southeast, Marlow Heights to the east, and Hillcrest Heights to the northeast.  Interstate 495/95, the Capital Beltway, forms the southern boundary of the Glassmanor CDP.See alsoOxon Hill, MarylandReferences   
Capital punishment in MarylandCapital punishment is a legal form of judicial punishment in the U.S. state of Maryland. It has been in use in the state — or more precisely, its predecessor colony — since June 20, 1638, when two men were hanged for piracy in St. Mary's County. A total of 309 people were executed by a variety of methods from 1638 to June 9, 1961, the last execution before Furman v. Georgia. Since that time, five people have been executed. Executions in Maryland are currently suspended as a result of a court case until the procedures used to perform the execution are approved using the process required by state law.HistoryUp until the second half the 20th century, most executions were by hanging. The exceptions were a soldier shot for desertion, two slaves hanged in chains, and one female slave who was burned at the stake. All hangings were performed in public in the county where the offence took place. In 1809, the Maryland legislature enacted laws that provided for murder in varying degrees. The mandatory punishment for first-degree murder was given as death. New laws came into force in 1908 which allowed the sentencing judge discretion, giving the option of life imprisonment. Then in 1916, the jury was given the option of deciding if they wished to impose the death penalty during their deliberations. They could now return a sentence of guilty "without capital punishment."This changed under new state laws in 1922, which required all hangings to be executed at the Metropolitan Transition Center (formerly known as the Maryland State Penitentiary) in Baltimore. It was designed to get rid of "the curious mobs that frequent hangings taking place in the counties of this State, and who attempt to make public affairs of the same." 75 men were hanged on the Penitentiary gallows. Of these, 12 hangings were double hangings and on two occasions triple hangings took place. The first indoor hanging in the state, would come before this time though, with an execution on 3 January 1913 in the Baltimore City Jail, which only had invited guests present.There is one known instance of a botched execution by hanging. On 30 January 1930, Jack Johnson stood on the trapdoor after being convicted of a double murder. But as he fell through, the rope snapped and he fell to the ground below. He was left badly injured and carried to the top of the gallows on a stretcher. There, a new rope was placed around his neck and he was hanged, supported by a stretcher. The Maryland government decided in 1955 to change the method of execution to the use of lethal gas in the gas chamber. A total of four men were executed in this fashion. The first was on 28 June 1957. During the 20th century number of convicts were also executed for rape. Constitutional challengesAfter the Furman v. Georgia decision of the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that death penalty statutes were unconstitutionally arbitrary in their application, the Maryland legislature removed all arbitrariness by making death the mandatory punishment for first-degree murder once again. Such laws were found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional in Woodson v. North Carolina. As such, the Maryland legislature took the route which the Supreme Court had found acceptable in Gregg v. Georgia and introduced bifurcated trials, where the jury first decided guilt and then punishment, mandatory appellate review, and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.    Further laws changes in 1987 and 1989 excluded juveniles and the mentally retarded from execution.The first person to be sentenced to death under Maryland's current statute was Richard Danny Tichnell, who was found guilty of murdering Garrett County Sheriff's Deputy David Livengood in 1979. Tichnell's sentence was overturned on appeal, as were two successive death sentences that prosecutors won against him. A fourth jury declined to impose the death penalty, and Tichnell died in 2006 of natural causes while serving a life sentence.  In 1994, the method was changed to lethal injection for persons convicted after March 25, 1994.  For person sentenced before 25 March 1994, the condemned is given the choice between the gas chamber and lethal injection. John Thanos was put to death using lethal injection on 16 May 1994. This was the first execution in Maryland in over 30 years.Governor Parris N. Glendening halted executions in Maryland by executive order on 9 May 2002, while a state-ordered University of Maryland, College Park study of capital punishment was conducted.  The study eventually concluded that there are racial and geographic disparities in the application of the death penalty in the state, but the subsequent governor, Robert Ehrlich, ended the moratorium and resumed executions in 2004. Administrative law challengeIn 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals in Evans v. Maryland ruled that state executions would be suspended because the manual that spells out the protocol for lethal injections was not adopted using the process required by the state Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Evans v. Maryland, 396 Md. 256, 914 A.2d 25 (2006).  The state APA requires state administrative agencies to adopt regulations, which are defined as statements that have general application and are adopted by an agency to detail or carry out a law that the agency administers, using a process that includes a review by the Attorney General, review by a legislative committee, and publication for public notice and comment. The state's Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services had adopted the manual without following any of these activities. The Court of Appeals noted that the procedures for execution in the manual were clearly regulations, and because they had not been properly adopted, they could not be used until they had been either adopted as required by the APA or the state law was changed.  The ruling in Evans, while not significant from an administrative law aspect as it was consistent with state case law, will prevent executions until the agreement is reached regarding both the need for the death penalty and in the method and procedure to be used to carry it out. The Maryland General Assembly in 2008 has established the Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment to provide recommendations concerning the application and administration of capital punishment in the state so that they are free from bias and error and achieve fairness and accuracy.  Following a series of public hearings, the Commission on November 12, 2008, voted 13-7 to recommend that the General Assembly repeal the capital punishment statutes as carries the real possibility of execution of innocent persons and may be biased against African Americans.  The Commission submitted its final report, along with a minority report, to the General Assembly dated December 12, 2008 which "strongly recommends that capital punishment be abolished in Maryland." On 6 March 2013, the Maryland State Senate voted 27-20 in favour of SB 276, a bill to repeal the death penalty  . This was followed by floor debates in the House of Delegates, and a vote on the bill may come as early as 15 March 2013. On 15 March 2013 the House approved the legislation by a 82-56 vote and sent the bill to the Governor who will sign it. So with this action, Maryland will become the 18th state in the US to ban the death penalty .Current state lawOnly first degree murder is a capital offense in the state of Maryland. Criminal Law § 2-201 of the Annotated Code of Maryland defines murder in the first degree as:A deliberate, premeditated, and willful killing.Committed by lying in wait.Committed by poison.Committed in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate arson, burglary, carjacking, escape from prison, kidnapping, mayhem, rape, robbery, sexual offense, sodomy, or bomb-making.If the offender willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation intended the death of a law enforcement officer.The state's attorney in a case involving a capital punishment eligible crime must give the defendant notice at least thirty days prior to the trial that the death penalty will be sought and the aggravating circumstances that the state will present to the jury. Under Criminal Law § 2-303, the sentence of death is imposed:"…by intravenous administration of a lethal quantity of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate or other similar drug in combination with a chemical paralytic agent."The lethal injection procedure used in Maryland consists of the anesthetic drug sodium pentothal, followed by the paralytic drug pancuronium bromide, which is also known as Pavulon, and lastly a drug which stops the heart, potassium chloride.  The execution is completed when, using an electrocardiogram, a physician declares the convict to be dead. Unlike most states, Maryland does not offer the condemned a special last meal; instead the prisoner receives whatever food the general prison population is served the day of the convict's death.As in any other state, people who are under 18 at the time of commission of the capital crime  or mentally retarded  are constitutionally precluded from being executed.Post-Gregg executionsA total of 5 individuals convicted of murder have been executed by the state of Maryland since 1976. All were executed by lethal injection.!Executed person Date of execution Victim(s) Under Governor 1 John Frederick Thanos May 16, 1994 Billy Winebrenner, Gregory Allen Taylor, and Melody Pistorio William Donald Schaefer 2 Flint Gregory Hunt July 2, 1997 Vincent Adolfo Parris Glendening 3 Tyrone Delano Gilliam, Jr. November 16, 1998 Christine Doerfler 4 Steven Howard Oken June 17, 2004 Dawn Marie Garvin, Patricia Hirt, Lori Ward Robert Ehrlich 5 Wesley Eugene Baker December 5, 2005 Jane Tyson Current Death Row Inmates5 men are currently sentenced to death in Maryland who are housed at the North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax facility located near Cumberland.!Inmate Date of crime Victim(s) 1 John Booth-El May 20, 1983 Rose and Irvin Bronstein 2 Vernon Lee Evans April 28, 1983 David Scott Piechowicz and Susan Kennedy 3 Anthony Grandison April 28, 1983 David Scott Piechowicz and Susan Kennedy 4 Heath William Burch March 19, 1995 Robert and Cleo Davis 5 Jody Lee Miles April 2, 1997 Edward J.

List of United States Senators from MarylandThis is a List of United States Senators from Maryland. Maryland ratified the Constitution on April 28, 1788, becoming the seventh state to do so.  To provide for continuity of government, the framers divided Senators into staggered classes that serve six-year terms, and Maryland's Senators are in the first and third classes.  Before the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which allowed for direct election of Senators, Maryland's Senators were chosen by the Maryland General Assembly. Until the assembly appointed George L. Wellington of Cumberland in 1897, Senators in class 3 were chosen from the Eastern Shore while Senators in class 1 were chosen from the remainder of the state.Class 1Class 1 U.S. Senators belong to the electoral cycle that were elected for one session of the U.S. Congress in the first election of 1788 and whose seats in recent years are contested in 1994, 2000, 2006, and 2012.# Senator Party Years Congress Term Electoral history 1  Charles Carroll Pro- Administration March 4, 1789 – November 30, 1792 1 1 Elected in 1789 2 2 Re-elected in 1791  Resigned to remain in the Maryland Senate Vacant November 30, 1792 – January 10, 1793 2  Richard Potts Pro- Administration January 10, 1793 – October 24, 1796 2  (Continued)  Elected to finish Carroll's term  Resigned 3 4 Vacant October 24, 1796 – November 30, 1796 3  John Eager Howard Federalist November 30, 1796 – March 3, 1803 4  (Continued)  Elected to finish Potts's term 5 3 Re-elected in 1796    6 7 4  Samuel Smith Democratic-Republican March 4, 1803 – March 3, 1815 8 4 Elected in 1803 9 10 11 5 Re-elected in 1809    12 13 Vacant March 4, 1815 – February 4, 1816 14 6 Legislature failed to elect 5  Robert Goodloe Harper Federalist February 5, 1816 – December 6, 1816 Elected late in 1815    Vacant December 6, 1816 – December 20, 1816 6  Alexander Contee Hanson Federalist December 20, 1816 – April 23, 1819 14  (Continued)  Elected to finish Harper's term  Died 15 16 Vacant April 23, 1819 – December 21, 1819 7  William Pinkney Democratic-Republican December 21, 1819 – February 25, 1822 16  (Continued)  Elected to finish Hanson's term 17 7 Re-elected in 1821  Died Vacant February 25, 1822 – December 17, 1822 8  Samuel Smith Democratic-Republican December 17, 1822 – March 3, 1833 17  (Continued)  Elected to finish Pinkney's term Crawford Republican 18 Jacksonian 19 20 8 Re-elected in 1827 21 22 9  Joseph Kent Anti- Jacksonian March 4, 1833 – November 24, 1837 23 9 Elected in 1833  Died 24 Whig 25 Vacant November 24, 1837 – January 4, 1838 10 William Duhurst Merrick Whig January 4, 1838 – March 3, 1845 25  (Continued)  Elected to finish Kent's term 26 10 Re-elected in 1839 27 28 11  Reverdy Johnson Whig March 4, 1845 – March 7, 1849 29 11 Elected in 1845  Resigned to become U.S. Attorney General 30 31 Vacant March 7, 1849 – December 6, 1849 12  David Stewart Whig December 6, 1849 – January 12, 1850 Appointed to continue Johnson's term  Retired when successor elected 13  Thomas Pratt Whig January 12, 1850 – March 3, 1857 Elected to finish Johnson's term 32 12 Re-elected in 1851 33 34 14  Anthony Kennedy American March 4, 1857 – March 3, 1863 35 13 Elected in 1857 36 37 15  Reverdy Johnson Unionist/ Democratic March 4, 1863 – July 10, 1868 38 14 Elected in 1863  Resigned to become Ambassador to England 39 40 Vacant July 10, 1868 – July 13, 1868 16  William Pinkney Whyte Democratic July 13, 1868 – March 3, 1869 40  (Continued)  Appointed to finish Johnson's term  Retired 17  William Thomas Hamilton Democratic March 4, 1869 – March 3, 1875 41 15 Elected in 1869  Retired to run for Governor 42 43 18  William Pinkney Whyte Democratic March 4, 1875 – March 3, 1881 44 16 Elected in 1875  Lost re-election 45 46 19  Arthur Pue Gorman Democratic March 4, 1881 – March 3, 1899 47 17 Elected in 1881 48 49 50 18 Re-elected in 1887 51 52 53 19 Elected in 1893  Lost re-election 54 55 20  Louis E.

Maryland General Assembly The Maryland General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland. It is a bicameral body. The upper chamber, the Maryland State Senate, has 47 representatives and the lower chamber, the Maryland House of Delegates, has 141 representatives. The General Assembly meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2,300 bills including the State's annual budget, which it must pass before adjourning. The 428th Session began on January 13, 2011 and adjourned on April 12. Like the Governor, members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.The Maryland General Assembly convenes within the State House in Annapolis.HistoryThe forerunner of the Maryland General Assembly was the colonial institution, an assembly of free Marylanders, which bore the same name.Maryland's foundational charter created a state ruled by the Palatine lord, Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter, and possessed absolute authority over his domain.However, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the House of Commons of England. Andrews, p.70  An act was passed providing that:"from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly...together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them...shall think good".In addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he desired. In some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that "assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least", ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.  During the American Revolution the colonial Assembly ceased to exist, and was replaced by its modern successor.Qualifications and membershipEach senator or delegate must be a citizen of Maryland and a resident of the state for at least one year preceding his or her election. A prospective legislator must have resided for the six months prior to election in the legislative district the candidate seeks to represent. A senator must be at least twenty-five years of age at the time of election and a delegate at least twenty-one. Persons elected to or holding a civil or military office other than as a member of a reserve component under the federal or State government are not eligible for election to the General Assembly.Each term lasts four years. However, members of the General Assembly are not term limited. If a vacancy occurs in either house through death, resignation, or disqualification, the Governor appoints a replacement whose name is submitted by the State Central Committee of the same political party as the legislator whose seat is to be filled.Legislative districtsThe current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial U.S. Census. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. In most districts, the three delegates are elected at large from the whole district via block voting. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state, the districts are divided into subdistricts for the election of delegates: either into three one-delegate subdistricts or one two-delegate subdistrict and one one-delegate subdistrict.LeadershipThe Senate is led by a President and the House by a Speaker whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders.Overview of legislative procedureA bill is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. A House Bill (HB) is one introduced in the House of Delegates (for example: HB 6);  a Senate Bill (SB), in the Senate.Bills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, HB 16 refers to the sixteenth bill introduced in the House of Delegates. The numbering starts afresh each session. The names of the sponsor (and co-sponsors, if any), the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title. Bills listed as "The Speaker (By Request of Administration)", "The President (By Request of Administration)", "Minority Leader (By Request of Administration)", or "Committee Chair (By Request of Department)" are bills proposed by the Governor and his agencies and are not proposals of the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader, or the respective Committee Chair. They are listed with the official title of a legislator rather than the Governor due to requirements in the Maryland Constitution. The legislative procedure, is divided into distinct stages:. The procedure begins when a Senator or Delegate decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the Department of Legislative Reference's bill drafting division, where it is drafted into bill form. The draft of the bill is returned to the legislator for introduction.Introduction or First Reading. A bill is introduced or read the first time when the bill number, the name of the sponsor, and the descriptive title of the bill are read on the floor of the house.Committee hearing. After introduction, a bill is assigned to the appropriate policy committee, appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. Notice of the hearing is published in the Maryland Register to allow for public comment. During the committee hearing the sponsor presents the bill to the committee, and testimony may be heard in support or opposition to the bill from any member of the public. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership for a bill to be passed and sent to the next committee or to the floor.Second reading. A bill recommended for passage by committee is read a second time on the floor of the house. Legislators, not on the committee where the bill received its public hearing, may only offer amendments to the bill at this stage. House bills in the Senate may be amended by Senators on second or third reading and Senate bills in the House may also be amended on second or third reading. After all amendments are considered, the presiding officer orders the bill to be printed for third reading. This printing would include any committee or floor amendments.Third reading. A roll call vote is taken. An ordinary bill needs a majority vote to pass. An emergency bill requires a two-thirds vote, a bill requiring the Maryland Constitution to be amended requires a three-fifths vote.Second house. If the bill receives a constitutional majority from the first house, the bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor's desk.Resolution of Differences (concurrence or conference). If a measure is amended in the second house and passed, it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may concur with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house conference committee. Appointed by the Senate President and the House Speaker, a conference committee consists of three members of each house. The committee sends a report of its recommendations to each chamber which then can adopt or reject it. If the report is adopted, the bill is voted upon for final passage in each house. If the report is rejected by either house, the bill fails.Governor's action. All passed bills, except the budget bill and constitutional amendments, must be presented to the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may veto bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.Veto overrides. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor's veto; a three-fifths vote of both houses is required to override a veto.Effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the Secretary of State. These chaptered bills are statutes, and ordinarily become part of Maryland law. Ordinarily a law passed during a regular session takes effect October 1 of the same year. Emergency bills go into effect as soon as the governor signs them; these include acts calling for special elections and emergency measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.

Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, 23rd Proprietary Governor of Maryland (c. 1741 – 2 September 1784) was a British colonial official and the last Royal Governor of Maryland. Although a popular governor and an able administrator, Eden's authority was overthrown by the events of the American Revolution, and in June 1776 he was invited by the Maryland Convention to leave for England. Eden was well-regarded at home and in the same year, 1776, he was made a baronet. He eventually returned to Maryland where he died in 1784 at the age of 43. He was buried in Annapolis and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Frederick, a noted author.Early lifeEden was born in Durham, England, on 14 September 1741, Eden at www.findagrave.com Retrieved January 2011  the second son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of West Auckland, and the brother of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley and a relative of North Carolina Governor Charles Eden.CareerIn 1763 Eden made an advantageous marriage, wedding the Hon. Caroline Calvert, daughter of Maryland's proprietor Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. In 1766 Caroline bore a son, Frederick. Three years later, in 1769, aged just 28, Robert Eden succeeded Horatio Sharpe as Governor of Maryland, the highest office in the Province. As Governor, Eden would attempt to maintain authority over the increasingly rebellious Province during the tumultuous years preceding the American Revolution. Maryland and the American War of Independence Eden was not among those who believed that coercion would force Marylanders into loyalty to the mother country. During the 1770s opposition to British taxation grew, and the Governor's authority began to falter. On April 19, 1774 Eden was forced to prorogue the Colonial Assembly, the last occasion on which it would convene.   From this point on the government of Maryland was increasingly in the hands of the Revolutionaries. On October 19, 1774 the Peggy Stewart was burned in Annapolis harbour in protest against taxes on tea, in imitation of the famous Boston Tea Party, which took place on December 16, 1773.   On December 30, 1774 Eden wrote:"The spirit of resistance against the Tea Act, or any mode of internal taxation, is as strong and universal here as ever. I firmly believe that they will undergo any hardship sooner than acknowledge a right in the British Parliament in that particular, and will persevere in their non-importation and non-exportation experiments, in spite of every inconvenience that they must consequently be exposed to, and the total loss of their trade." Although Eden had some sympathy with the colonists' grievances, he was firmly opposed to armed opposition to the Crown. In the event, Maryland was the only state that did not forcibly eject its last proprietary governor from office, choosing instead a formal and largely courteous transfer of power. By 1775 Eden's authority had been effectively usurped by the Annapolis Convention and Eden was eventually asked by the Maryland Council of Safety to step down as governor. The Maryland Convention had been pressed by the Continental Congress (and the Virginians in particular) to arrest and detain Eden but they demurred, preferring to avoid such an "extreme" measure. Instead they argued that:"This Convention, and the Council of Safety for the time being, were the only proper and adequate judges of the propriety and expediency of suffering Governor Eden to depart out of this Province, and have proceeded in that matter upon evidence which was satisfactory to themselves, and to which the convention of Virginia were strangers" Andrews, p.317 Eventually the Maryland Convention formally asked the Governor to leave, and Governor Eden finally departed Maryland for England in the ship Fowey on June 23, 1776,.  He was created a baronet, of Maryland in North America, in 1776.Family lifeIn 1763 Eden married Caroline Calvert, daughter of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore,  and in 1769 he succeeded Governor Horatio Sharpe as Governor of Maryland. Caroline was half-sister to Benedict Swingate Calvert, a Judge of the Land office with whom Eden shared a love of horse racing.

Glenmont, Maryland Glenmont is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. The U.S. Census Bureau combines Glenmont with nearby Wheaton to create the Census Designated Place of Wheaton-Glenmont.LocationDue to its unincorporated nature, the boundaries are difficult to precisely define, but the center of the community is located at the intersection of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue (Maryland State Highway 97).TransportationGlenmont is a suburban crossroads of sorts. Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97) passes through the community. Southbound along Georgia Avenue is Wheaton, downtown Silver Spring, and the District of Columbia. North of Glenmont on Georgia Avenue is Aspen Hill (another unincorporated community) and Leisure World, a large retirement community. Route 97 continues north through Howard and Carroll counties to Pennsylvania.Meeting Georgia Avenue at the heart of Glenmont is Randolph Road. The intersection of Georgia Avenue and Randolph Road is heavily congested, and there are plans to replace the current, at-grade intersection with a grade-separated interchange. Georgia Avenue is under study as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route in the Countywide Transit Corridors Functional Master Plan. The State Highway Administration is also studying BRT along Georgia Avenue between Glenmont and Olney.Layhill Road (Maryland Route 182) has its southern terminus at Georgia Avenue, just north of Randolph Road.The Glenmont Metro station serves the area.   This underground station, which opened in 1998, is at the east end of the Red Line, and has a large parking garage.  From Glenmont, the Red Line heads south to downtown Silver Spring and to the District of Columbia before re-entering Montgomery County and terminating at Shady Grove. Public safetyThe Kensington Volunteer Fire Department has a fire station at the intersection of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue.  Montgomery County Police District 4 headquarters is also located at the intersection.  The Maryland-National Capital Park Police has its headquarters in an old elementary school on Layhill Road.ShoppingThere is a large shopping center on the northeast corner of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue. It has a supermarket, pharmacy, office supply store, one gasoline service station, local pub, convenience store, barber shop, sporting goods store, numerous small markets and restaurants, and a branch office of the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. There are also other restaurants and stores scattered along Georgia Avenue.HousingThere are three large garden apartment complexes and a condominium at the heart of Glenmont. The rest of the area consists of single family homes and a few townhouses. Most of the housing stock west of Georgia Avenue is older and smaller; east of Georgia Avenue, the homes are newer and larger. However, there are a few sites west of Georgia Avenue where homeowners have demolished small, older homes and built larger, newer ones in their place. Nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of the area's housing units are owner-occupied, though this is less than the countywide homeownership rate of 75 percent.EducationTwo public high schools (John F. Kennedy High School and Wheaton High School) serve Glenmont. There is at least one elementary school, Glenallan, in the community. Not far from the unofficial boundary with Aspen Hill, but inside the area commonly considered to be part of Glenmont (3100 Regina Drive), can be found the community's other elementary school, Georgian Forest.There is also Highland Elementary School.TerrainThe area consists of modest rolling hills broken by small streams, all of them fed mainly by run-off from storm drainage, although the community contains at least one natural spring still producing acquifer-fed water. All streams to the east side of Glenmont are part of the Anacostia River watershed; they flow into the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia, which empties into the Potomac. Streams to the west of Glenmont generally reach the Potomac by way of Rock Creek, with Georgia Avenue serving as a rough dividing line between the two drainage areas.Civic AssociationIn October 2008, the Greater Glenmont Civic Association (GGCA)   was founded to address rising crime rates in Glenmont, and to encourage the Montgomery County government to re-vitalize the Glenmont area, just as the county had done in the neighboring Wheaton and Silver Spring areas.  According to GGCA documents, crime has been reduced in the Glenmont area by about 15% as of June, 2010.  The GGCA has won several awards and grants for its activities.

Interstate 795 (Maryland) Interstate 795 (I-795), also known as the Northwest Expressway, is a nine-mile (14 km) freeway linking Baltimore's northwestern suburbs of Pikesville, Owings Mills and Reisterstown, Maryland to the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695).  The route bypasses Maryland Route 140 (MD 140), Reisterstown Road), carrying part of the Baltimore Metro Subway in its median for a four-mile stretch, and provides direct access to Owings Mills Mall.  It never connects to its parent, I-95, except via I-695.Route descriptionI-795 begins in Pikesville at a directional T interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway), which heads south toward Glen Burnie and east toward Towson. I-695 provides access to I-95 in the directions of Washington and New York and to highways into Baltimore. Immediately to the east of the interchange is the Old Court station of the Baltimore Metro Subway, which passes through the interchange and settles into the median of the six-lane freeway as they cross Gwynns Falls. I-795 parallels and has two crossings of CSX Transportation's Hanover Subdivision as the freeway and transit line head northwest. The subway line ends just north of its and the highway's second crossing of Gwynns Falls at the terminal Owings Mills station.  Immediately to the northwest of the subway terminus is I-795's interchange with Owings Mills Boulevard (unsigned MD 940), which is a partial cloverleaf interchange with flyover ramps from northbound I-795 to southbound Owings Mills Boulevard and from the southbound boulevard to the southbound Interstate. The interchange also features direct ramps with Owings Mills Town Center to and from the direction of Baltimore and direct ramps with the subway station to and from the direction of Reisterstown. I-795 continues northwest as a four-lane freeway. The highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Franklin Boulevard before reaching its northern terminus at MD 140 on the edge of Reisterstown. The terminus consists of direct ramps with MD 140 to and from the direction of Westminster and an intersection with MD 140 (Westminster Pike) and MD 795, an unnamed and unsigned connector between the intersection and an intersection with MD 30 and MD 128 on the north side of Reisterstown.  HistoryThe Northwest Expressway was one of the first freeways planned for construction in the state of Maryland. The first four-mile (6 km) section to the Owings Mills exit was completed in 1985; the remaining five miles (8 km) were completed in 1987.The original plan was for the highway to run into the City of Baltimore along a similar route to that of the Metro Subway. Plans to extend the highway beyond its current configuration have not been sought out by highway officials in Maryland. This alignment would most likely have terminated at Wabash Avenue, which parallels the elevated section of the Metro Subway. Exit list       See also References External links MDRoads: I-795Scott M.

Carrollton, Maryland Carrollton is a locality in Carroll County, Maryland, USA.  It is not to be confused with Carrollton Manor in Frederick County, from which Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a prominent signer of the Declaration of Independence, took his name. It also should not be confused with New Carrollton, MD which is located in Prince George's County. New Carrollton, a Washington suburb created in the 1950s, was originally also called "Carrollton, Maryland," until a name change occurred in 1966.

Claiborne, MarylandClaiborne is an unincorporated community in Talbot County, Maryland. The village is located on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay near the mouth of the Eastern Bay at  , and uses ZIP code 21624. The 2000 U.S. Census lists the population as 147 and the number of homes as 84, slightly down from its 1941 population of 156. Between 1890 and 1952, the village was a busy port for passenger and then automobile ferry service across the Chesapeake Bay, with numerous stores and motels/resorts, including Maple Hall. A post office was added in 1893 and  the Protestant Episcopal Church of Claiborne was built in 1898. In 1912 an elementary school and Methodist Church were added. Before 1912, students attended school in nearby McDaniel. The town's first school consisted of the kitchen of the local railroad pavilion, used as a classroom, where Miss Dolly Thompson taught. Teachers in later years included Grace Oldham, Alice Dawson, Edna Harrison, and Lida Smith. In 1913, the town became home to the Claiborne Fresh Air Association, Inc., (“Miracle House”) which was formed for the purpose of providing 10 weeks of fresh air and summer vacation for children who had been exposed to tuberculosis.HistoryPrior to the 1870s, Claiborne was part of the nearby McDanieltown postal community (now McDaniel). Its name can be traced back in honor of William Claiborne, a fur trader who founded an English settlement on nearby Kent Island in 1631. Early land patents in Claiborne included "Rich Neck Manor," which was first granted to James Mitchell in 1652. Either Mitchell or the subsequent owner of Rich Neck, Philip Land, built a chapel in the 1650s. The Rich Neck Manor Chapel still stands and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, but is private property. Rich Neck was also home to Matthew Tilghman, the head of the Maryland delegation to the Continental Congress, and Lloyd Tilghman, Confederate general.It was past the entrance to today's Claiborne harbor that British vessels passed during the War of 1812, landing in McDanieltown, within sight of Claiborne. The area of town now known as "Old Claiborne," was located on Tilghman’s Creek facing the Miles River. It included a steam sawmill started by John Hansel Tunis around 1867. "Bingham's Steamboat Wharf" was also in use for steamboats on their way up the Miles River to St. Michaels. By 1877, John Tunis' son, Joseph Tunis, had added the Claiborne Oyster Company, a boatyard, a few homes, two more steamboat wharves, and expanded his father's sawmill into the Claiborne Saw and Planing Mills. At the foot of Rich Neck Road was a general store. Tunis also laid out grids for a new community of 188 lots and advertised them for between $18 and $40. A plat of it appears in an 1877 county atlas, showing eight main streets with the names: Rich Neck Road, Leeds, Ward, Progress, Monument, Tilghman, and Dom Pedro. At its center was Henry Clay Square, a large area reserved for public buildings. Joseph Tunis provided a slogan: “Young man don’t go West, but to Claiborne.” The village did not develop as Tunis had hoped and by 1893, Tunis had abandoned his plans. In later years several families from North Carolina who knew or where employed by the Tunis family in their North Carolina lumber mills relocated to "Old Claiborne", for example Ben Perry whose home in "Old Claiborne" was built in 1905.A second community, the "new" Claiborne, was started in 1886 when Gen. Joseph B. Seth and the Baltimore & Eastern Railroad Company agreed to begin ferry and railroad service between Claiborne and Bay Ridge, on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Seth along with Theophilus Tunis and Frank Turner envisioned a resort community similar to Bay Ridge and laid out plans for the "new" Claiborne, calling it "Bay City”.Although "Bay City" never developed as expected, Claiborne’s importance was raised once the ferries began operating with Claiborne as a primary terminus on the Eastern Shore. In 1890 the Baltimore & Eastern Railroad completed a railroad line from Claiborne to Easton so that passengers coming into Claiborne could continue through to Ocean City. Later operated by the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway, the railroad service continued until 1928, although by 1924 the BC&A had already shifted most of its traffic to Love Point. In 1927 the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway filed for bankruptcy and was sold at foreclosure on March 28, 1928. One parcel was for the company's railroad and the Claiborne ferry, and was sold for $650,000. The ferry operation by the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway was almost halted in 1915 due to a decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission against the BC&A's parent company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, dictating that the company surrender some of the steamboat lines which they operated on the Chesapeake Bay. In the end, the Pennsylvania Railroad had to sell off or end all its ferry lines operating between Baltimore and points on the Eastern Shore other than the one at Claiborne.A second ferry company, owned by the son of Hetty Green, began service in 1916 between Claiborne and Annapolis using the steam yacht "Texas". The business failed in 1919.In 1919, a competing ferry, the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company, began service between Claiborne and Annapolis. On Sunday evening it was not uncommon for traffic to be backed up several miles into Claiborne, waiting for the return ferry trip across the Chesapeake Bay. The increased automobile traffic to Claiborne forced the state to take the then unusual step of passing a special roads bill to improve the road between Claiborne and Easton, Maryland. In 1921, bus service was added from Claiborne to Easton, Hurlock, and Cambridge. This may have been in part because of accusations that the BC&A's passenger railroad service out of Claiborne would often intentionally leave early to strand passengers arriving on the competing boats of the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company. In 1938 the ferry route was changed to run from Claiborne to Romancoke on Kent Island, and then Matapeake on Kent Island to Sandy Point, on the western shore. Ferry service stopped running in 1952 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built.Jolly Sam, the Christmas pony, now resides at Mineral Spring Farm, in Claiborne, he arrived in early spring 2007.Pictures1877 AtlasReferences"Denton Journal", 23 Aug 1890. article: "The Tuckwogh Chartered as a Transfer""Denton Journal", 15 Oct 1890. article: Timetable advertised for Balto. and Eastern Shore Railroad in effect for 29 Sep 1890"Denton Journal", 2 Dec 1893. article: "Claiborne now has a postoffice""Denton Journal", 28 Aug 1915. article: "TO RESTORE COMPETITION""Denton Journal", 17 Jan 1920. article: "The Governor has decide to have the Claiborne road built"PRR Corporate HistoryGuide to the Checklist of Maryland Post Offices"Talbot County: A History", Dickson Preston"Steamboats Out of Baltimore", Robert H.

Flag of Maryland The flag of the state of Maryland consists of the heraldic banner of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. It is the only state flag in the United States to be based  on English heraldry. (While the flag of Washington, D.C., is a representation of the coat of arms of the Washington family, Washington, D.C., is not a state.) It was officially adopted by Maryland in 1904.DesignThe black and gold design on the flag is the coat of arms of the Calvert family. It was granted to George Calvert as a reward for his storming a fortification during a battle (the vertical bars approximate the bars of the palisade).  The red and white design is the coat of arms of the Crossland family, the family of Calvert's mother, and features a cross bottony. Since George Calvert's mother was an heiress, he was entitled to use both coats of arms in his banner.HistoryThe Maryland colony was founded by Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, hence the use of his coat of arms in the flag. At first, only the gold and black Calvert arms were associated with Maryland, being reintroduced in 1854. Maryland State Flag History (Maryland Secretary of State.) Retrieved August 29, 2012.  The red and white Crossland arms, which belonged to the family of Calvert's paternal grandmother, gained popularity during the American Civil War, during which Maryland remained with the Union despite many citizens' support for the Confederacy. Those Marylanders who supported the Confederacy, many of whom fought in the Army of Northern Virginia, adopted the Crossland banner, which was red and white with the botony (trefoil) cross   (seen as "secession colors"). . The black and gold (yellow) colors with the chevron design of the Calvert family were used in the flags and devices of the Union regiments in the Army of the Potomac.After the war, Marylanders who had fought on either side of the conflict returned to their state in need of reconciliation. The present design, which incorporates both of the coats of arms used by George Calvert, began appearing. At first, the Crossland coat of arms was put in the upper-left corner, but this was supposedly swapped with the Union's Calvert arms because of the Union victory. The flag in its present form was first flown on October 11, 1880, in Baltimore, Maryland, at a parade marking the 150th anniversary of the founding of Baltimore. It also was flown on October 25, 1888, at the Gettysburg Battlefield during ceremonies dedicating monuments to Maryland regiments of the Army of the Potomac. However, it was not officially adopted as the state flag until 1904 (Chapter 48, Acts of 1904, effective March 9, 1904). In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Maryland's flag fourth best in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territory flags ranked. Legal descriptionSection 13–202 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland provides:(a) The State flag is quartered.(b) The 1st and 4th quarters are paly of 6 pieces, or and sable, a bend dexter counterchanged. Thus, the 1st and 4th quarters consist of 6 vertical bars alternately gold and black with a diagonal band on which the colors are reversed.(c) The 2nd and 3rd quarters are quarterly argent and gules, a cross bottony counterchanged.  Thus, the 2nd and 3rd quarters are a quartered field of red and white, charged with a Greek cross, its arms terminating in trefoils, with the coloring transported, red being on the white ground and white on the red, and all being as represented upon the escutcheon of the State seal.The Maryland Secretary of State publishes a "Protocol for the Maryland State Flag" which, among other things, specifies the colors of the flag:1.04. The red and yellow colors in the Maryland flag should conform to the following Pantone Matching System colors:red on coated stock: PMS 201red on uncoated stock: PMS 193yellow on coated stock: PMS 124yellow on uncoated stock: PMS 124Flagpole restrictionsMaryland is the only state in the union that has a specific guideline not only on how to display the flag but on what the flagpole should look like as well. In 1945, the Maryland General Assembly made a gold cross bottony the official ornament for any flagpole carrying the state flag. Some time before October 10, 2007, Government House (the governor's mansion) in Annapolis ceased to display the cross bottony at the top of the flag pole, but the flags at the State House continue to do so (adhering to Maryland Code Section 13-202 and 203). All other government buildings, including public schools, obey this guideline, but many private individuals and businesses do not.Cultural impactThe Calvert and Crossland coats of arms, and the flag itself, have been adapted for use in various ways across the state.On September 9, 2008, the University of Maryland painted both end zones at Byrd Stadium with the flag's two patterns.Some Maryland counties and municipalities have arms and/or flags incorporating elements of the arms, including the city of Baltimore, Baltimore County, Howard County, Calvert County, Caroline County and Worcester County.The University of Maryland athletic teams have long used the colors of the state flag. All four colors from the flag are currently used, with the primary colors being red and white, with black and gold used as accent colors. The men's basketball team uses gold and the football team uses black as alternate colors. The Maryland flag is also displayed on the right shoulder of the football uniforms. At the start of the 2011 football season, the team unveiled a new uniform designed  by Baltimore-based sportswear company Under Armour combining both parts of the flag. Similarly, the men's lacrosse team features designed from the flag on the jersey shoulders. The end zones of Byrd Stadium are often decorated in a Maryland flag motif, and the state flag is run onto the field during almost all the athletic games.The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), also in the University System of Maryland, has all four colors located in its main logo.The shield of Loyola University Maryland utilizes both the Calvert shield in its upper-left quadrant, as well as a stylized red and yellow quadrant, symbolic of the Maryland state flag.The seal of The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore features the same design and colors as the Maryland flag. The Johns Hopkins colors are sable and gold, taken from the Calvert coat of arms (though the athletic colors are blue and white, as the school mascot is the Blue Jay).The secondary logo of the Baltimore Ravens in the National Football League is a shield with alternating Calvert and Crossland Banners interlocked with a stylized "B" and "R".Starting with the 2009 season, the Baltimore Orioles baseball club has added a patch to the left arm of their uniforms that features a round version of the Maryland flag.The gold and black Calvert coat of arms and red and white Crossland coat of arms are featured in the seal of the town of Ferryland, Newfoundland, present day site of Calvert's Colony of Avalon.Southwest Airlines changed the livery of a 737-700 to a Maryland state flag theme in 2005, dubbed Maryland One.

UMB graduate school offers 43 degree programs in total.Library FacilitiesThe University of Maryland, Baltimore has two main libraries on its campus: the Health Sciences & Human Services Library (HS/HSL) and the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.UMB's Health Sciences & Human Services Library was founded in  1813 from the collection of Doctor John Crawford, a former British naval surgeon, and is the origin of the entire University of Maryland Library System. Dr. Crawford's initial donation of books remains within the library's Historical Collections department as the Crawford Collection (comprising some 569 items).  The first location of the library was the Provost's Office within the original medical school building, now known as Davidge Hall. Under the leadership of its first official library, Dr. Eugene F. Cordell (who served as library director from 1903-1913), the library grew rapidly, incorporating book collections from the schools of pharmacy and dentistry, and moving into its own building, a former church on the southeast corner of Lombard and Green Streets. The church was later razed in 1957 to make way for a new library that began construction in 1958 and opened in 1960. The library has since moved, in 1998, into a large modern building. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library, named for Baltimore native and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, is the law library for the University of Maryland School of Law. The Marshall Law Library is found inside the law school's building, accessible through the main entrance. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library contains over 400,000 volumes of Anglo-American legal materials as well as outstanding international and foreign law collections. Extensive collections of both primary sources and secondary materials such as treatises are available.  The library is open to all faculty, staff and students on the campuses of the University System of Maryland; University of Maryland School of Law alumni; attorneys; and members of the general public. Name of the InstitutionThe professional schools housed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore may also simply use the name "University of Maryland" when describing themselves even though the University of Maryland, College Park also refers to itself simply as the University of Maryland. There is relatively little confusion resulting from the shared name because the University of Maryland, College Park offers largely research-oriented graduate programs and houses fewer professional schools. The University of Maryland, Baltimore does not offer NCAA sports. Although this university mainly offer graduate and professional study, it offers few undergraduate courses, which include nursing, dental hygiene and medical technology. By law and tradition each school is entitled to use the "University of Maryland" name in recognition of their shared history.  While both schools are University System of Maryland institutions, neither is a part of the other.The University of Maryland, Baltimore is also often mistaken for the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), which is a separate University System of Maryland institution located in the town of Catonsville, outside the City of Baltimore.CampusThe campus is composed of 58 buildings located near Camden Yards and Baltimore's famous Lexington Market. Construction on a new   campus center began at the start of 2007 and opened in August 2009 as the Southern Management Corporation Campus Center (SMC Center).  The SMC Center contains dining facilities, meeting locations and the campus's gymnasium and recreation facility, URecFit. UMB has also recently undertaken a vast west campus expansion. This   project, known as BioPark, will create ten new buildings containing a total of   of classroom, lab, and office space.  In addition, University of Maryland Medical System has cleared a downtown site for the construction of a $329 million ambulatory care center.The university is served by the University Center/Baltimore Street station of the Baltimore Light Rail system, which is at the eastern edge of campus. The Orange Route of the free Charm City Circulator provides service to both the BioPark and through the UMB campus to the inner harbor and points east.Starting with the 2012-2013 school year, the University launched a new shuttle bus service for university students, staff, and faculty and University of Maryland Medical Center employees free of charge. The shuttle runs 3 routes from the university to West Baltimore (the new BioPark center), Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon. Campus PoliceThe university is protected through the University of Maryland, Baltimore Police Department. The UMB Police department is a state and nationally accredited police agency providing law enforcement services to the UMB campus and surrounding communities.    Through an agreement signed between the UMB Police Department and the Baltimore City Police Department, UMB Police officers have the same jurisdiction and authority as Baltimore City Police officers throughout the campus of the university.  The UMB police force is composed of both sworn officers and unarmed security guards who are located in university-owned buildings to control access to the buildings and for other security purposes.  The UMB Police force also provides escort services to students and university personnel throughout the campus, either though an escort vehicle, or a walking escort by an officer.

Robert Alexander (Maryland) Robert Alexander (c. 1740 – 1805) was an American planter, lawyer, and Tory political leader during the American Revolution. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress for Maryland in 1776.BackgroundRobert Alexander was born on his family's estate at Head of Elk in Cecil County, Maryland about 1740. He was educated to the law and admitted to the bar, and practiced in Baltimore. From 1774 to 1776, he attended the Annapolis Convention as a representative of Baltimore County. He also represented Baltimore in the state's Committee of Safety. On December 9, 1775 the Convention named Alexander one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. He attended sessions starting in January 1776, and on January 16 the Congress added him to their Secret Committee. Then in April he was added to the Marine Committee. He was re-elected, 4 July 1776, but soon after the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence he sailed for England with other Baltimore loyalists.In August 1777, after British forces had landed at Head of Elk, he was visited at his home, first by George Washington on the 27th, and then by British General Howe three days later. When the British moved north towards Philadelphia he accompanied them, and was never to return. By the summer of 1778, when Howe abandoned the occupation of Philadelphia, Alexander fled to the Royal Navy, and made his way to London in 1782.In 1780, the State of Maryland judged Alexander guilty of high treason, and seized most of his property. His estate became the town Elkton, Maryland, although the wife he had abandoned was allowed to keep the main house that his father had built in 1735. The house still stands, and is located at 323 Hermitage Drive in Elkton.Alexander died in exile in London, England on November 20, 1805.References Further readingJanet B.

Clarksville, MarylandClarksville is the name of an unincorporated community in Howard County, the third wealthiest county in the United States according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The community is named for William Clark, a farmer who owned much of the land on which the community now lies.According to the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau, Clarksville District 5 had a population of 56,239, with median income of $150,272. The estimated average income in 2009 was $195,124, with median income of $160,606. Some of the most expensive homes on the East Coast are located in or around the town, whose property values are among the highest in the country.The villages of River Hill  and Pheasants Ridge are contained within Clarksville, the newest additions to the planned community of Columbia.Clarksville's public schools, part of the Howard County public school system, are among the highest-ranked in the nation and often have significantly higher funding than competing private and charter schools. The area is located southwest of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C., and many residents of Clarksville commute to work in one of these two cities or their close-in suburbs.Montrose and Richland Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.   SchoolingClarksville is perhaps best known for its highly successful high school, River Hill. The school made the 397th rank on Newsweek's Top 1,200 High School    River Hill, opened in 1996  It has 1,652 students and ranks as one of the top schools in the state of Maryland.  In 2005, River Hill has a 97.55% graduation rate, ranking the highest in Maryland.  86.3% of its students passed the HSA (High school Assessment). River Hill is also very successful in sports, capturing numerous state titles in many sports. The boy’s soccer team has captured three of the last four class 3A state titles (losing in 2006 to rival Mount Hebron).  In 2007 River Hill won five state championships in the fall: Football, Boys and Girls Soccer, and Boys and Girls Cross Country. In addition, Clarksville Middle School's Wind Ensemble attended the prestigious Midwest Clinic in 2009, being the first middle school from Maryland to perform there.Pop cultureClarksville, MD was referenced in the Fox television show 24 as the target for surface missiles by terrorists in the seventh season episode having the original air date 4/13/09.References

Maryland State House The Maryland State House is located in Annapolis and is the oldest state capitol in continuous legislative use, dating to 1772. It houses the Maryland General Assembly and offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The capitol has the distinction of being topped by the largest wooden dome in the United States constructed without nails. The current building, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960     is the third statehouse on its site. The building is administered by the State House Trust, which was created in 1969.ConstructionConstruction began in 1772 and was not completed until 1779 due to the ongoing American Revolutionary War. The statehouse was designed by Joseph Horatio Anderson, a noted architect of the time. The two-story building is of brick construction in the middle of State Circle. The building is designed in the popular Georgian style of the day. A small portico juts out from the center of the building and is topped by a pediment, two high arched windows frame the entrance. On both floors, large rectangular windows line the facade. A cornice is topped by another pediment and the sloping roof gives way for a central octagonal drum atop which rests a dome. The large dome is topped by a balustraded balcony, another octagonal drum and a lantern capped by a lightning rod. The rod was constructed and grounded according to the direct specifications of its inventor, Benjamin Franklin.    The dome of the statehouse is depicted on the Maryland state quarter.RotundaIn the rotunda is the Maryland Federalist a replica built in 1987 of the miniature ship Federalist. Large Corinthian columns support the arches bracing the large dome above. A balustrade lines the second floor balcony.The replica of the Maryland Fedealist is actually on a more or less permanent display in the Lobby at the Thurgood Marshall Baltimore Washington International Airport Terminal. Later in the summer of 2012, the original handwritten text of George Washington's Resignation Letter will be on display in the Rotundra of the Capital. This can be confirmed by contacting the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis, MD.ChambersOld Senate ChamberTo the right of the entrance is the old Senate Chamber. Chairs and desks were added to the room in the exact number (16) as originally furbished. The desk for the president is an original piece made by John Shaw in 1797.It was in the Old Senate Chamber that George Washington famously resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. A mannequin of George Washington stands in period clothing at the front of the room.Less well known, but important nonetheless, is the historic event that occurred on February 2, 1781 when Governor Thomas Sim Lee, in the presence of the members of both Houses of the State Legislature, signed and sealed the "act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the Articles of Confederation."   The decision established the requisite unanimous consent of all thirteen states for the formation of a Perpetual Union. This was the final act of formation of the United States of America as a nation. The approval of the much awaited law also removed any doubt about the resolve of the states to unite during the Revolutionary War. In 1861, the fact that "the faith of all the then thirteen States was expressly plighted and engaged that [the Union] should be perpetual" was considered of major importance by President Abraham Lincoln when declaring the secession of the southern states from the Union to be illegal.The chamber had extensive investigation beginning in 2007 to solve water leakage problems. As a result of this study, restorers have determined that previous restoration attempts in 1905 and 1940 did not accurately recreate many elements of the room. A report of their findings was issued in January 2010 and work continues.   Working Senate ChamberThe Senate chamber is located in a wing added to the original structure between 1902 and 1905. The room is illuminated by a Tiffany-style skylight above. Red carpet emblazoned with the state seal covers the entire floor. Large Ionic columns line the walls and support the viewing gallery. The marble along the walls and the columns are flecked with rust and black, Maryland's official colors.Two famous Marylanders are featured in statues flanking the podium: John Hanson, the first president by the Articles of Confederation, and Charles Carroll, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Four portraits of Declaration of Independence signatories for Maryland hang on the walls: William Paca, Thomas Stone, Samuel Chase, and Charles Carroll.    There are also portraits of Edwin Warfield and John Walter Smith.   Working House ChamberThe House of Delegates chamber is also in the new wing to the building. The carpet is navy blue and designed with a diamond and olive sheaths. The same rust and black marble lines the chamber and forms the Ionic columns along the walls. A spectators' gallery is above the rostrum. The speaker sits in front of a broken marble pediment supporting a clock. Portraits of former Speakers of the House hang on the walls.Governor's Reception RoomThe Governor's Reception Room is on the second floor. The room is mainly ceremonial and used for bill signings. Portraits of former governors hang on the walls. Portraits of Henrietta Maria and Queen Anne hang nearby.   United States CapitalFrom November 26, 1783 to August 13, 1784, Annapolis was the capital of the United States. The Congress of the Confederation met in the Maryland State House. Subsequently, Annapolis was a candidate to become the new permanent national capital before Washington, D.C. was built.United States district courtThe United States District Court for the District of Maryland met there for the first decade of its existence.    In 1800, judge Samuel Chase tried a local postmaster for embezzlement and sentenced him to thirty-nine lashes. To execute the sentence, the defendant was tied to one of the statehouse columns.

University of Maryland University College  The University of Maryland University College (UMUC) is located in the unincorporated community of Adelphi in Prince George's County, Maryland in the United States. Serving over 90,000 students worldwide, UMUC is one of the largest distance learning universities    that is open to all applicants with a 100 percent acceptance rate for undergraduate programs.    The university offers 120 academic programs in instructor-led and online classes, including bachelor, masters, and doctoral degrees as well as undergraduate and graduate certificates. Profile - USM   UMUC is a member of the University System of Maryland, which includes eleven separate public universities in Maryland.  History UMUC is an outgrowth of the evening program for adults at the University of Maryland that began in the 1920s. In 1947, the College of Special and Continuation Studies (CSCS) was established. Page Does Not Exist   In 1959, The CSCS became the University of Maryland University College (UMUC). In 1970, UMUC became an independent institution, and it became a member of the University System of Maryland in 1988. UMUC formerly had an international campus in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany (near Stuttgart) until 2001. It also ran a 2-year residential campus in Munich, Germany from 1950 to 1992, which then moved to Augsburg, Germany from 1993 to 1994, and then to Mannheim, Germany in 1995 until it finally closed in 2005.  The residential campus offered a two-year Associates degree and mainly served high school graduate children of U.S. military and government personnel stationed in Europe.UMUC offers courses on over 130 military installations at locations throughout Europe and the Middle East, as well as in Asia.  In 2004, UMUC shared the ICDE Prize of Excellence from the International Council for Open and Distance Education.  In FY 2007, UMUC offered onsite classes in 22 countries throughout the world, enrolling 16,908 and 21,554 individual students, respectively, through its Asia and Europe divisions, including the Middle East. University nameUMUC is a college in the traditional American sense of the word, albeit one associated with a university—hence, "University College." The "University of Maryland" prefix indicates the historical entity to which the college belonged originally. In the university's name, "University College" represents "the specialized concentration on professional development," while "University of Maryland" represents the affiliation of the university with the University System of Maryland.    To American ears, the words "university" and "college" may sound synonymous, and "University College" would be redundant in its name. Among the collegiate universities of Europe, however, the practice of giving one college in the university the name "University College" is not uncommon. In England, for example, one of the 39 colleges of the University of Oxford is called University College, Oxford. When UMUC first opened in 1947, the school was named College of Special and Continuation Studies to distinguish it as an institution independent from the University of Maryland, College Park.  In 1953, Raymond Ehrensberger, chancellor of the institution at that time, wanted to change the name to something more meaningful and less cumbersome for people to say and remember. Early suggestions for the name included College of General Studies, College of Adult Education and University College.  In 1959, Chancellor Ehrensberger persuaded the University System of Maryland's Board of Regents to change the name to University of Maryland University College. The name "University College" was adopted from the British university system to depict an educational institution offering "courses and programs from all academic departments outside the university's walls and normal class times."  Therefore, UMUC is not a division of the University of Maryland, College Park, but rather a separate institution within the University System of Maryland.Academic and degree programsUMUC is one of the largest providers of distance education in the United States.    Courses are delivered in traditional classroom settings, as well as online. Even before the advent of online education by way of the Internet, UMUC was a distance education pioneer and offered distance learning using its WebTycho interface by way of dial-up access. UMUC later adopted the use of the Internet for connectivity to its online classrooms, as well as using television and correspondence courses to deliver course content.Colleges and schoolsUndergraduate SchoolGraduate SchoolUndergraduateThe Undergraduate School offers 32 bachelor's degree programs and 48 undergraduate certificates,  which are awarded in business management, computers/information technology, communications, criminal justice/legal studies, and social sciences.  Undergraduate students can earn credit through classroom-based and online courses or through the Cooperative Education and Prior Learning programs. The Undergraduate program serves as a continuation of the Community Colleges of Maryland and elsewhere. The Cooperative Education and Prior Learning programs offer an escalated degree option for education and training completed in the workplace or military.  This program provides general education credits that can be applied towards a degree at UMUC.GraduateThe Graduate School offers 18 master's degree programs, 38 graduate certificates, and a Doctor of Management.  Most graduate programs are available in both classroom and online formats. Several master's degrees are available in an accelerated Executive format.Deployed LocationsUMUC offers face-to-face courses and support in Afghanistan and Djibouti, Africa. UMUC deploys both faculty members and staff members to bases throughout Afghanistan and at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti to support the war-fighters on those bases. UMUC has accompanied the war-fighters in downrange locations since the Army gave them clearance in 2005.AfghanistanCurrently, UMUC offers courses and services at the four main Army Education Centers, located in Bagram Air Field, Kabul (Camp Phoenix), Salerno and Kandahar. Bagram Air Field is the largest site in Afghanistan, with about 275 active enrollments each session, and up to twenty face-to-face courses. All four sites have collegiate professors and Field Representatives stationed on them to assist soldiers, airmen, Marines, and sailors with UMUC's programs and courses.Field Representatives, commonly referred to as Field Reps, deploy with faculty members to help promote and facilitate UMUC's program at each site. Field Reps assist students with enrollment, tuition assistance, and textbook sales, as well as guidance and assistance with academic goals and careers. The Field Rep is also responsible for the local program, to include marketing and maintaining relationships with military personnel.Faculty members assigned to a downrange location teach service members wherever they may be. Classroom space is limited in Afghanistan, and faculty members teach their classes anywhere they can, to include hangars, unit conference rooms, dining facilities, even chapels and picnic benches. Faculty members, known and referred to as instructors, also assist the Field Rep located where they are in assisting students and promoting classes and programs.DjiboutiClasses are held at Camp Lemonnier on the Naval base in Djibouti City.  Classes are taught by on site faculty members and can also be taught by military personnel who hold Master's or Doctoral degrees and have prior teaching experience.  A full-time UMUC faculty member also serves as a counselor for students already enrolled in UMUC programs, and to those military members who would like to take classes.  Most students at Lemonnier receive tuition assistance through military programs to support higher education for its members.Campus and facilitiesHeadquarters/main campusThe headquarters for UMUC is located in Adelphi, Maryland near the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park. Until late 2000, the UMUC headquarters was listed in College Park, Maryland. In an attempt to establish its own identity as an independent university and move away from the common notion of serving as the "night school" for non-traditional students, UMUC changed its postal address to Adelphi, an unincorporated community that borders College Park. The address change with the U.S. Postal Service involved no physical move of people and facilities. The marketing decision to change its postal address was one of many undertaken by UMUC to distinguish the university as one of the largest distance-education centers, with over 80,000 students enrolled worldwide.Academic buildingsAcademic Center at LargoStudent & Faculty Services Center (SFSC) (Headquarters)Inn & Conference Center (ICC)UMUC purchased for $38 million its new headquarters building in Largo, Maryland, which was once the headquarters site for Hechinger and corporate offices of Raytheon.    UMUC retrofitted its new headquarters to meet "green" building requirements for LEED certification.  UMUC followed the same process as it did to achieve LEED certification in 2005 for its Inn & Conference Center, which became the first hotel complex in the United States to achieve certification as a green building.  UMUC began relocating its academic departments and offices to its new Academic Center at Largo in September 2009, and completed the process in 2010.    UMUC began offering on campus classes at its new Academic Center in the Spring 2010 semester. Satellite campusesUMUC operates satellite campuses across the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, throughout Maryland, as well as in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.Baltimore-Washington metropolitan areaIn the greater Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, daytime, evening and weekend classes are held at 21 locations, including holding many of its classes at the University of Maryland, College Park campus.  The satellite campuses offer varying academic services, including advising, computing, and library facilities (extensive library services are available to distance education students via the University's Information and Library Services department).UMUC operates a facility in Dorsey, Maryland adjacent to the Dorsey MARC Train Station.  In partnership with Maryland community colleges and other University System of Maryland institutions, UMUC offers courses and degree programs at several higher education centers throughout the state. In conjunction with the College of Southern Maryland, it operates the Waldorf Center for Higher Education in Waldorf, Maryland.  A consortium of universities led by Anne Arundel Community College, including UMUC, operates a higher education center adjacent to Arundel Mills mall in Hanover, Maryland.  In addition, the University offers courses at the Universities at Shady Grove and University System of Maryland at Hagerstown, which are part of the University System of Maryland.Global locationsIn Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, UMUC offers courses on military bases for service members, contractors, Federal employees, and their families.  In addition to distance learning via the Web, the university offers on-site, instructor-led classes at 130 overseas US military bases in 22 countries throughout the world.  Overseas instruction is coordinated through its European,  which covers USCENTCOM installations in the Middle East, and Asian  Divisions. UMUC divisional headquarters are located in Heidelberg, Germany near United States Army Garrison Heidelberg and on Yokota Air Base, Tokyo, Japan, respectively.  Student profileUMUC specializes in distance learning for adult, non-traditional students in Maryland, across the country, and around the world by operating satellite campuses and offering online instruction.  The university educates 50,000  active-duty service members at over 130 military installations.  In FY 2009, more than 30,000 Marylanders attended UMUC.   The USM Board of Regents predicts UMUC's enrollment will increase 48% by 2018. About three quarters of the undergraduate students attend part-time. Best Colleges | Find the Best College for You | US News Education   Over ninety-two percent of UMUC students are employed full-time.  The majority of undergraduate students are female.  The median age of stateside undergraduate students is 31.  Almost two-thirds of the graduate MBA students are married, half are female, and over a third are minorities.  Over a third of UMUC's stateside students were African-American, and this minority group earned over a third of the degrees awarded by the university. AwardsIn 2011, UMUC received the Institution Award from the Council of College and Military Educators (CCME), a not-for-profit organization founded to promote, encourage and deliver quality education to servicemembers and their families in all branches of the U.S. armed services. The Institution Award is given to a college or university that supplies quality education programs to the armed services. CCME selected UMUC due to its dedication, leadership and numerous accomplishments in providing quality, voluntary off-duty education programs.

Cresaptown, Maryland Cresaptown is a community located in Allegany County, Maryland, United States of America. It is an unincorporated community which, for United States Census Bureau purposes, is united with Bel Air to form the census-designated place of Cresaptown-Bel Air. Cresaptown's post office was established December 22, 1800.  Cresaptown is several miles southwest of Cumberland, Maryland.HistoryPrior to 1728, Cresaptown was the site of a former Shawnee village along the Potomac River.  The inhabitants of this region were a portion of the Shawanese tribe, a sub-division of the Algonquian group, one of the most warlike combinations of that period. The warriors engaged in hunting and fishing for food and furs, while their families were left at home to tend the maize and grass that grew in the rich soil of the Potomac valley. The maize was ground into corn meal and made into Shawnee cake a popular diet of the Shawnees living in the valley. William Harrison Lowdermilk, "History of Cumberland, Md", Harvard University, 1878, page 19-20 The Shawanees in the valley lived in shelters composed of two forked posts that were driven into the ground and on these was laid a ridge pole.  small saplings, cut to a length of about eight feet, were laid against the pole, one end resting on the ground, forming a shelter similar to a V shaped tent.  This was covered with bark and skins and made tight enough to protect against rain or snow.  The floors were spread with furs, which made sure for seats or beds. IndustryThe North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax prison facility, is located in Cresaptown.  The 372nd Military Police Company, known for participating in Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, is based here, though is slated to move to Grand Prairie, Texas.Nearby CitiesCumberland, MarylandSee alsoThomas CresapRegional BusinessesReferences

Maryland railway station   Maryland railway station is located in Maryland, an area of Stratford, in the London Borough of Newham in east London, England. It was originally known as Maryland Point, and is just east of Stratford station in Travelcard Zone 3, on the Great Eastern Main Line. The station was first opened on 6 January 1873, and was fully rebuilt in 1891 when the line was quadrupled.  It adopted its current name on 28 October 1940. "News in Brief", The Times, 23 October 1940, p. 2.  Of the four platforms, only those serving the 'slow' lines are in regular operation, the 'fast' line platforms being used only when necessary during temporary train path diversions.The station is one of the primary rail access points for the residential areas in the north of Stratford and the south of Leytonstone in east London. The area surrounding the station has seen much redevelopment in recent years, with ongoing improvements underway related to the nearby Olympic Park.  Notably, the "Twisted Clock" timepiece/sculpture formerly installed outside Stratford Station has been relocated to Maryland.In May 2012, train operator Greater Anglia announced the start of a half-million pound investment programme for Maryland Station, including redecoration, re-roofing of platform canopies, and repairs to guttering.  Further upgrading of the station is expected in preparation for the arrival of Crossrail services in 2018.Train ServicesThe following services currently call at Maryland:Operator Route Material Frequency Notes Greater Anglia London Liverpool Street - Stratford - Maryland - Forest Gate - Manor Park - Ilford - Seven Kings - Goodmayes - Chadwell Heath - Romford - Gidea Park - Harold Wood - Brentwood - Shenfield Class 315 6x per hour        OlympicsDuring the 2012 London Olympics Maryland station would have been heavily used by fans who want to get into the venues in Stratford.

The platforms are too short for Crossrail's ten-car trains, and cannot easily be lengthened due to physical contraints.  Nevertheless Crossrail has committed to providing a full service, making use of Selective Door Operation, such that doors on some end carriages will remain closed. An agreement was also reached about improving access to the station. Crossrail trains are due to replace the present Shenfield Metro service in 2018, which will result in a greatly increased range of direct destinations served by trains from Maryland.ServicesThe station is served by Greater Anglia metro services between   and  .

Hunt Valley, Maryland  Hunt Valley is an affluent unincorporated community in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States.  It lies just north of the city of Baltimore, along Highway 145 off Interstate 83. Loch Raven Reservoir. Located at a latitude of 39.5° North and longitude 76.7° West.  Hunt Valley is the home of Systems Alliance, Inc., BreakAway Games, Sinclair Broadcast Group, McCormick & Company, AAI Corporation, Dunbar (Armored Vehicles), TESSCO Technologies,  KCI Technologies, Inc. and ZeniMax Online Studios.  It was the former home of Noxell Corporation, makers of Noxzema, before Noxell was acquired by Procter & Gamble in the early 1990s. It was also the former home of  PHH and Firaxis Games, both of which now reside in Sparks, Maryland which is a few miles to the north of Hunt Valley.MicroProse, a leading video game developer from the 1980s, was originally based in Hunt Valley.The Hunt Valley Inn is the most popular hotel in Maryland for Science fiction conventions. Over the years it has hosted Balticon, Shore Leave, Horrorfind, Monster Mania, Nostalgia Con, FaerieCon, ClipperCon and Farpoint. Hunt Valley is served by the Cockeysville, Maryland post office, and also is home to a satellite campus of the Community College of Baltimore County.Many Baltimore County residents declaim that Hunt Valley doesn't actually exist—it is often grumbled that "Hunt Valley" is a fanciful name cooked up by real estate developers during the development of the area in the 1970s and 1980s; that is, "Hunt Valley" is more of a name brand than an actual place. People of noteSid Meier, Canadian video game designerPublic transportationHunt Valley is well known in the Baltimore area as a result of its public transportation. It is the northern terminus of the Light Rail line, and is also served by the Route 9 bus. Only one-half of light rail trains operate to the Hunt Valley terminus, with the remainder only running as far as Timonium. The frequency of service is every 15 minutes all day daily and on weekends and holidays. Route 9 operates on an approximately 20 minute interval daily.  See   and          County, Maryland}} 
Loyola University Maryland   Loyola University Maryland is a Roman Catholic, Jesuit private university in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Established as Loyola College in Maryland by John Early and eight other members of the Society of Jesus in 1852, it is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities,  the ninth-oldest Jesuit college in the United States, and the first college in the United States to bear the name of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus.  Loyola's main campus is in Baltimore and features Collegiate Gothic architecture, as well as a pedestrian bridge across Charles Street.  Academically, the university is divided into three schools: the Loyola College of Arts and Sciences, the Loyola School of Education, and the Sellinger School of Business and Management. It operates a Clinical Center at Belvedere Square in Baltimore and has graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.The student body is composed of a little less than 4,000 undergraduate and 2,600 graduate students, representing 34 states and 20 countries, and 84% of undergraduates reside on campus. The average class size is 25, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1. Approximately 65% of the student body receives some form of financial aid. Campus groups include the Association of Latin American & Spanish students (ALAS) and the college newspaper, The Greyhound.Notable alumni include Tom Clancy, author of The Hunt for Red October, Mark Bowden, and author of Black Hawk Down. Loyola's sports teams are nicknamed the Greyhounds and are best known for the perennially ranked men's and women's lacrosse teams. The men's lacrosse team's biggest rival is nearby Johns Hopkins University. The annual lacrosse games played between these two institutions is known as the "Battle of Charles Street",  The school colors are green and grey. History FoundingLoyola College in Maryland was founded in 1852 by John Early and eight other members of the Society of Jesus, and was the first college in the United States to bear the name of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Loyola College in Maryland is the ninth-oldest among the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges and universities.The college's first campus was on Holliday Street in downtown Baltimore. In 1855, Loyola relocated to a larger facility in the city's historic Mount Vernon neighborhood, and moved to its present Evergreen campus in north Baltimore in 1922. Evening classes commenced in 1942.ExpansionIn 1949, the college established a graduate division in education, adding a graduate degree program in business management in 1968, a graduate program in speech pathology in 1971, and finance in 1973. Today, the college's list of graduate programs has grown to include psychology, modern studies, pastoral counseling, computer science, and software engineering.Loyola became coeducational in 1971, following its joining with Mount Saint Agnes College, a neighboring women's college that was experiencing financial difficulties and closed following the joining. That same year, the college's Board of Trustees elected its first lay chairperson.Working from these foundations, Loyola has transformed itself from a small, commuter college into a residential college with an undergraduate population of more than 3,000 students. In 1981, Loyola established a separate business school: The Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, Jr., School of Business and Management. The school would expand geographically with two graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.Designation changeThe Executive Committee of the college's Board of Trustees announced on August 20, 2008 its decision to change the institution's name to Loyola University Maryland.  Its request was approved on March 25, 2009 by the Maryland Higher Education Commission, with the change officially taking effect five months later on August 19.    The Reverend Brian F. Linnane, the university's president, stated that the "college" designation no longer fit the school and that its comprehensive array of academic fields, some with graduate programs, was better reflected in its new name. Some alumni were disappointed because they felt the change made the institution less distinct from Loyola University Chicago, Loyola University New Orleans and Loyola Marymount University. Jesuit tradition Loyola University Maryland was founded by the Society of Jesus in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola.      The Society of Jesus, and therefore Loyola University Maryland, operate according to the mandate Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (AMDG), directing their ends toward that which brings forth the "greater glory of God". This cornerstone of the Jesuit philosophy functions to remind students that their education is meant to be applied toward the betterment of humanity and the worship of God, in particular. Loyola's focus on cura personalis, or the education of the whole person, functions to attain that end. A broad base of knowledge, supported by a strong liberal arts core, prepares Jesuit students to undertake the goal of AMDG.In keeping with this overarching principle, Loyola undergraduates must complete the core curriculum which includes courses in English, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, natural science, and social sciences.  Though Loyola encourages plurality, its religious heritage is preserved and cultured by encouraging all of its students and faculty to cultivate and live by the core values of the Society of Jesus.In 1950, Loyola was awarded the Sidney Hollander Award for its contribution to the establishment of civil and political rights for African Americans in Maryland. EndowmentLoyola's endowment operates under the umbrella of "Preparing Tomorrow: The Campaign for Loyola College Maryland."   The endowment mainly supports academic programs and scholarships.  Major contributions include a $1 million grant from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation to increase enrollment of low income students.  By June 2005, the campaign reached $93 million. Academic programsThe foundation of a Loyola education is a broad core program that covers basic knowledge and concepts in the humanities, math and science, and the social sciences. The purpose is to balance general education and specialized study in the major. Undergraduate degrees are awarded in three schools, Loyola College, the School of Education, and the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management. The university operates on a semester system. Loyola CollegeCoinciding with the university's transition to its new name, the College of Arts and Sciences became Loyola College on August 19, 2009.  It offers degrees in biology, chemistry, classics, communication, comparative cultures and literary studies, computer science, economics, education, engineering science, English, fine arts, French, German, global studies, history, an honors program, interdisciplinary studies (including American, Asian, Catholic, film, gender, Latin American/Latino and medieval studies), law, mathematical science, military career, modern languages and literatures, nursing, philosophy, physics, political science, pre-health curriculum/programs (including medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and optometry/podiatry), psychology, sociology, Spanish, speech-language pathology/audiology, theology, and writing.Sellinger School of Business and Management The Sellinger School of Business and Management offers degrees in accounting, business economics, finance, general business, international business, management, management information systems, marketing, and the Sellinger scholars program. In 1984 the business school was formally named the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management in honor of the late Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger, earning accreditation in all programs by AACSB (The International Association for Management Education) in 1988. Loyola is the only private institution in the state of Maryland with a nationally accredited business school.  In 1990, the accounting department earned specialized national accreditation from AACSB. School of EducationSince 1946 the department of education has been one of the stronger academic pillars at Loyola. With the 2009 name designation change, President Linnane announced the opening of The School of Education which was to be led by Peter C. Murell, Jr. as the first dean. The School was officially opened on October 14, 2009.  The School now offers undergraduate majors in Elementary Education and minors in Secondary Education and Special Education. Its graduate department offers Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (M.Ed.), the Certificate of Advanced Study in School Management (C.S.M.), and the Certificate of Advanced Study in Education (CASE).Admission   More than 10,000 students apply for admission as freshmen for approximately 1,000 spaces. Strong grade performance is particularly emphasized in Loyola’s admission evaluation. Loyola students typically have achieved a 3.5 grade point average in their high school work, and are evaluated based on the rigor of their high school curriculum. The class of 2013 was the last applicant class that was required to submit SAT scores. The admission office has now begun a four-year pilot program that does not require standardized test scores, deeming them optional.

In addition, Loyola has two satellite campuses in Timonium and Columbia for graduate classes. The college also owns   in the mountains of western Maryland, used for the Rising Phoenix Retreat Center. The Loyola Clinical Centers are located just a short drive from the college’s main campus, in Belvedere Square. The Clinical Centers offer individuals in the community a broad range of services addressing educational, language, and psychological issues.At the western side of the Quad on the Evergreen campus lies the Alumni Memorial Chapel. Formally dedicated on September 15, 1952, the chapel features Gothic architectural influences with large stained-glass windows and a long, narrow nave situated along the east-west axis. A statue of Our Lady of Evergreen, Queen of Peace, is situated above the front façade.On the eastern side of the Quad, and in the center of campus, is the Tudor-style Humanities Center, originally built by the Garrett family in 1895 as a wedding gift for one of their children. Unfortunately, the child died during a trip to England, and the residence became a rehabilitation center for men blinded during the war. In 1921, Loyola's Jesuits purchased the Evergreen property from the Garretts and gradually moved the college from its location on Calvert Street. The mansion was originally used for classes, but then became the Jesuit residence. In 1955, it suffered severe fire damage and was converted to offices following the restoration. Today, the Humanities Center houses 16 departments, including Admissions, Alumni Relations, Financial Aid and the Philosophy, Theology, and History departments.In the northern side of the Quad lies the Sellinger School of Business and Management, which opened in January 2000. The   facility features a more contemporary style, with Spanish influences, including a soaring, five-story glass façade, open atrium, a four-story glass tower, and three seminar rooms.On the southern side of the Quad lies Beatty Hall, Jenkins Hall, and Xavier Hall. Each of these buildings, used to house classrooms and various departments, is heavily influenced by Gothic and Edwardian architectural styles.The dormitories housing students are located west of the main campus, and are connected by Loyola's pedestrian bridge (or USF&G Pedestrian Bridge), spanning Charles Street. Loyola's dormitories, in most cases purchased apartment buildings, include Newman Towers, Campion Tower, and Seton Court. Further up North Charles Street is the Fitness and Aquatic Center, which opened in fall 2000, featuring a   fitness center with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, stair climbers, free weights, selectorized weight circuit and stretching area. The Mangione Aquatic Center features an eight-lane,   swim course; a shallow lane and diving well; as well as an on-deck sauna and hot tub. The   indoor rock climbing wall and bouldering area is designed for all levels. The FAC also has a two-court gymnasium used for club sports, intramural sports, and informal recreation. The Multi-Activity Court features a sport court surface ideal for indoor soccer, volleyball, and inline sports. The FAC also features an elevated walking/jogging track, two group exercise studios, an Outdoor Adventure Center, classroom and conference room, an equipment room, locker rooms, four racquetball and two squash courts, and an outdoor grass field.Loyola shares with the Notre Dame of Maryland University (formerly College of Notre Dame of Maryland) the Loyola Notre Dame Library, located between the two schools, and features a   interior; interactive study and instructional spaces; an exhibition area and curatorial space for special collections; expanded stack areas for humanities print collection; a café fully wired for voice, data, and video; five high-tech seminar rooms; digital studio for collaborative student and faculty projects; a media center with 96-seat auditorium; and a 24-seat, fully wired bibliographic classroom. SustainabilityThe University employs a full-time administrator and several student staff members dedicated to advancing sustainability on campus.    Two roof-top solar panels were installed during the summer of 2008, and a green residence hall features recycled metal beams, a green roof, and geothermal heating and cooling.

Students take one class and one lab each week, plus physical fitness training three times per week. Courses cover everything from the structure of the Army to military operations and tactics. Upon completion of the program, cadets are commissioned as officers in the U.S. Army and must complete a period of service in either the Active Duty, Army Reserve or Army National Guard. Since its inception in 1952, the ROTC program has commissioned more than 1,100 cadets. Loyola's Army ROTC program has a partnership with Towson University, the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, and Goucher College.More than half of the student population has participated in some community service activity during their time at Loyola. The Center for Community Service and Justice engages students by developing service opportunities in a wide variety of areas. The center offers nearly 40 ongoing community service programs, more than 15 one-time service opportunities throughout the year, and several immersion programs. Students also have an opportunity to become involved through service learning, which pairs community service with academic coursework.Sixty-five percent of Loyola's undergraduate students studied abroad during their junior year.

Suitland, Maryland Suitland is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George's County, Maryland, about   southeast of Washington, D.C. As of the 2010 census, the population of the CDP was 25,825.    Prior to 2010, Suitland was part of the Suitland-Silver Hill census-designated place.The community was named for 19th century landowner and businessman, State Senator Samuel Taylor Suit, whose estate, "Suitland," was located near the current intersection of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads.   GeographyAs an unincorportaed area, Suitland's boundaries are not officially defined.  The U.S. Geological Survey locates the center of Suitland at 38°50'49"N 76°55'33"W.   This area is roughly bounded by Southern Avenue (D.C. Line) to the north, Branch Avenue (MD 5) to the west, Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) to the east, and Donnell Drive/Suitland Parkway/Meadowbrook Drive (Henson Creek) to the south. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland has a total area of  , a 25% reduction from the 5.6 sq. mi. used in previous years.   While the Census Bureau defines the CDP as all land, the Suitland Bog and portions of Henson Creek, a tributary of the Potomac, are located off of Suitland Parkway near the southern border of the CDP.  Suitland Bog is one of the last of the natural bogs in the D.C. region, which numbered around thirty before the onset of suburban development.     This wetland ecosystem features sweet bay magnolias and other rare species of plants, including northern pitcher-plants, lady slipper orchids, sundews, and sphagnum moss.Parks and RecreationThere are two community recreation centers (Bradbury Heights Recreation Center and William Beanes Community Center) and 4 parks (Auth Village Neighborhood Park, Douglas Patterson Community Park, Dupont Heights Neighborhood Park, and Michael J. Polley Neighborhood Park) maintained by the Prince George's County Department of Parks and Recreation. Demographics 2010Note: For the 2010 Census the boundaries of the Suitland CDP were changed reducing the land area by approx. 25%. As a result, the population count for 2010 shows a 22.9% decrease, with a population density increase of 4%. As of the 2010 census, there were 25,825 people and 10,139 households residing in the Suitland CDP.  The population density was 6148 people per square mile. There were 10,805 housing units at an average density of 2572 per square mile. The racial makeup of the community was 91.9% African American, 2.6% White, 0.4% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 4.7% Latino, 1.7% from other races, and 2.1% from two or more races. There were 10,139 households out of which 3,682 were households with no family and 6,457 were identified as household with families.  Of those households, 30.9% were married couples living together, 32.4% had a female householder, and 9% had a male householder.  The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 3.19.In the census area, the population was spread out with 23.9% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 17.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.5 years. The median income for a household in the census area was $56,217, and the median income for a family was $61.393.  The per capita income for the area was $26,040. 7.4% (+/- 2.0%) of the population and 6.5% (+/-2.4%) of families were below the poverty line.

European settlers established their first Maryland colony on Saint Clement's Island (renamed Saint Mary's City) in 1694, and by the 1660s-1680s, settlers had moved into what is now known as Prince Georges County.  Faced with this encroachment, the Piscataways left the area in 1697, moving north to what is now known as Conoy Island, and eventually moving further north into Pennsylvania and Michigan.  The sole export of the incoming settlers was tobacco, and slaves were first brought to the county in the 1700s.Nineteenth centuryPrior to the Civil War, as a result of tobacco production, Prince Georges County was one of the wealthiest counties in Maryland and half of the county's population were slave.   After the war, old plantations were broken up and replaced by communities of centered around small farming and country villages.In 1867, Samuel Taylor Suit moved to Maryland and purchased more than 800 acres near Washington, D.C.   In the 1870s-1880s, the Suitland estate was visited by prominent guests, including U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, and was the site where an international tribunal of representatives settled negotiations for the 1871 Alabama claims.  After Suit's death in 1888, portions of the estate were sold (circa 1892-1903) to William A. Harrison, and the land was subsequently subdivided and sold over the years.  Suit's son, Arthur B. Suit, retained 3 acres of land near the corner of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads, where he maintained a general store, bar, bowling alley, and the community's one-room jailhouse. Twentieth centuryBy the turn of the century, the village of Suitland had added a post office, churches, and several houses.   On August 10, 1909, local residents met at the home of George J. Hess and organized the Suitland Improvement Association of Maryland to raise funds for a community meeting hall.  Three officers were elected to serve one year posts: President - Dr. C.M. Emmons; Vice President - C.L. Jenkins; and Secretary and Treasurer, George J. Hess.  The Association was incorporated on November 17, 1950 and is now known as the Suitland Civic Association. There are two historic cemeteries in Suitland, Cedar Hill and Lincoln Memorial.   Cedar Hill Cemetery was founded in 1901 and built on the former Nonesuch Plantation.  Prior to 1913, it was known as Forest Lake Cemetery and was likely renamed after the cedar trees that lined both sides of Suitland Road from the D.C. line to Silver Hill Road.  Early churches performed baptisms at this location and it is also the burial site for victims of the 1906 Terra Cotta Railroad wreck.   Lincoln Memorial Cemetery was founded in 1927 on the former Landon dairy farm and is the site where many prominent African-Americans are buried.  Individuals include Dr. Charles Richard Drew, who established improved techniques for blood storage and developed large scale blood banks early in World War II, and Nannie Helen Burroughs, educator and civil rights activist. The first one-room schoolhouse was built in 1891 on land purchased by the community.  A two-room schoolhouse was later built in 1915 on Silver Hill Road, expanded to four rooms in 1922, and saw additions to the building in 1928, 1941, and 1957. Property owned by James West and Joseph Friday, located near the current intersection of Swann and Silver Hill Roads, was used as an airfield from 1938 to 1941.   Named "Skyhaven" by a local student who won the naming contest sponsored by West and Friday, Skyhaven Airfield hosted a flying club that served 20 small planes, including Wacos, Great Lakes, and Pipers.Suitland remained a rural farming community until the onset of World War II.  To meet the need for additional office space to support the war effort, in September 1941, the Public Buildings Administration awarded a $2,749,000 contract to McCloskey and Co. of Philadelphia to develop a new federal office building in Prince Georges County, Maryland.     Later that year, 437 acres of farm and dairy land were purchased in Suitland to build the Suitland Federal Center.  The 12 existing residences on this property included the former dairy and summer home of Albert Carry, the German-American founder of the National Capital Brewing Company and the Carry Ice Cream Co.  The Suitland House, built by Lowell O. Minear, a pioneer designer of memorial parks, is the sole remaining residence on the Federal Center property.  A colonial-revival style home, it now serves as office space for the U.S. Census Bureau and is included in the Prince Georges County Planning Department's 2010 Approved Historic Sites and Districts Plan. In 1942, the Suitland Manor apartments were built in anticipation of new federal workers.  Parkway Terrace, Whitehall Square, and Marlborough House developments soon followed to accommodate the influx of Census Bureau and other federal employees.  In 1943, the Census Bureau turned 14 acres of land at the Federal Center site into the largest Victory Garden in the Washington metropolitan area.   The land was a parceled into 616 plots and plowed, fertilized, and tended by census employees.  As late as 1989, 110 garden plots were still available for summer rental on a first come, first serve basis for $7.00 each.  These gardens were located at the site of the current Navel Intelligence Building.In 1944, the Suitland Parkway was opened to connect the Army's Bolling Air Force Base (Bolling Field) to the Camp Springs Army Military Reservation, now known as Andrews Air Force Base.   The   of highway, originally named the Fighter Command Station Access Parkway, was initially limited to military use only and came under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in 1949.Suitland Junior-Senior High School, was the first high school in Suitland.   The building was dedicated on November 15, 1951 to the high ideal of freedom of education, with John W. McNamara presiding as master-of-ceremonies and principal Thomas Warthen accepting the dedication on behalf of the students and faculty.The 1950s-1960s were a period of major growth for Suitland, as new middle and working class families settled into the newly built residential communities.  However, this population boom came to an end around 1970 due to several converging factors.  These include the availability of cheaper land and lower taxes in neighboring county jurisdictions; the ending of the postwar baby boom; the slowdown in the rate of federal government growth; and migration patterns spurred by school busing mandates leading to regional demographic shifts.   The 1970s were both the beginning of a period of population adjustment and a recognition of Suitland's unique local history.  Beginning in 1973, Prince Georges County became the largest school district to adopt a busing plan after the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education.   The demographic changes caused by desegregation busing changed the county, transforming a great number of neighborhoods that were formerly middle-class and white to black and upper-middle class, and these shifts are reflected in the current population demographic of the Suitland CDP.In 1975, local historian Darlene Norton was elected to draft a local history of the township in preparation for Suitland's centennial celebration.    A History of Suitland, Maryland, 1867-1976 (1976) includes a detailed history of early residents, businesses, land purchases, and the development of Suitland civic, public, and private enterprises.  That same year, local resident Walter Coley organized a committee within the Suitland Citizen's Association to preserve the Suitland Bog, which led to the purchase of 20 acres of woods and wetland by the Maryland National Capitol Park and Planning Commission.   In the 1980s, crime associated with vandalism, property violations, landlord absenteeism, and drugs were seen as a threat to the federal workers who were now commuting into Suitland from outside the community, and in 1983, a razor wired fence was erected around the Federal Center complex.     Through most of this decade, neighborhoods near the Federal Center remained distressed and in need of a plan for positive change and growth.In the mid-1990s, county executive Wayne Curry conceived a plan to revitalize Suitland as part of a greater county-wide effort to improve townships located inside the Beltway.   In 1997, as the first stage of the Prince Georges County Redevelopment Authority project to revitalize the site, the Manchester Square housing development was turned over to the county.  Two years later, the fence surrounding the Federal Center was replaced with a regular wrought iron fence.Twenty-first centuryThe Suitland Metro, an extension of the Washington Metro Transit Authority's Green Line, opened to the public January 13, 2001.In 2004, Windsor Crossing, a $45 million multifamily condominium complex built by Stavrou Associates in partnership with the Prince Georges Redevelopment Authority, was completed on the former Manchester Square development.   In 2005, the $15.7 million Suitland Elementary School was opened to the public as part of the revitalization plan.   The Redevelopment Authority is currently planning on developing the 22-acre Suitland Manor site into a mixed-use Town Center project.In 2006, multi-million dollar federal renovations of the U.S. Census Building and National Oceanic and Atmospheric headquarters were completed.  Major renovations were also completed at the the Spauldings Branch Library in 2012, which serves Suitland and surrounding communities.In addition, two revitalization projects were detailed to the public in 2012, the Buy Suitland initiative and the Green Suitland Neighborhood Stabilization Project.  The Buy Suitland initiative offers up to 5% purchase price to first time home buyers, up to 7% purchase price to local civic workers, or 35% of purchase price or $40,000 to debt-to-income candidates for properties located in 11 census tracts.  Green Suitland NSP is allocating over $2 million dollars for the purchase of foreclosed and abandoned homes to be rehabilitated with enviro-friendly, cost-saving upgrades before they are offered up for resale. TransportationThe major roads in Suitland are mostly 2-3 lane highways.  Suitland Parkway runs through the entirety of the Suitland CDP, and the Capital Beltway can be accessed from Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) and Branch Avenue (MD 5).  The community is served by the Washington Metro Suitland station (Green Line), located at the intersection of Silver Hill Road and Suitland Parkway.Major highways Interstate 95 enters the county at Laurel.

Following a referendum in 1853, the colony declared its independence from the Colonization Society and formed the Republic of Maryland. It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro Rivers. In 1856, the independent state of Maryland (Africa) requested military aid from Liberia in a war with the Grebo and Kru peoples who were resisting the Maryland settlers' efforts to control their trade in slaves. President Roberts assisted the Marylanders, and a joint military campaign by both groups of Americo-Liberian colonists resulted in victory.

Wilde Lake, Columbia, MarylandWilde Lake is a reservoir and also the name of the surrounding neighborhood, or "village", located in Columbia, Maryland, just north and west of the Columbia Town Center.   It was the first portion of the "New Town" of Columbia to be built during the late 1960s, and was occupied in 1967. Mitchell, pp. 58, 79-81, 151   The lake and village are named for Frazar B. Wilde, a past chairman of the board of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. "The Neighborhoods of Wilde Lake", columbiamaryland.com, accessed May 29, 2009   In 1963, the company agreed to invest in the project and, in return, acquired an equity participation. This arrangement was subsequently formalized by the creation of The Howard Research and Development Corporation, the joint venture established to develop Columbia. Kimco Realty Corporation, the current owner of the village center, proposed a controversial redevelopment plan in 2008, that would have torn down buildings and built a large number of apartments in a mixed-use project.  A Kimco executive declared that plan to be "null and void" at a June 1, 2009 meeting.  The vice-president of Acquisitions and Development said: "I have no idea what the concept is [now]."  NeighborhoodsNeighborhoods in the Village of Wilde Lake include: Bryant Woods (named for William Cullen Bryant), Faulkner Ridge (named for William Faulkner), Running Brook (where the streets are named for Robert Frost's poems and Aesop's Fables) (The Birches is located within Running Brook). ServicesThe village center is located in the Wilde Lake Village Green, and has a small grocery store, various restaurants, and other retail establishments.   The Wilde Lake Community Center, called Slayton House, was named for John Slayton, first manager of the Columbia Association. The Wilde Lake Interfaith Center is located in the village center. EducationWilde Lake High School, alma mater of actor (and grandson of Columbia founder James W. Rouse) Edward Norton,    is located in the Village of Wilde Lake. Wilde Lake High School was the first high school to open in Columbia in 1971. It was the "first in the country to use individual study 'learning activities packages' for self-paced learning." The school has 3 stories with skylights, and open hallways that overlook a central hallway nicknamed "Main Street." It is home to The Jim Rouse Theater, which houses performing arts performances for both the school's programs and for organizations throughout Columbia. The school is well known for its performing arts program. "Wilde Lake High School Profile, 2008-2009", www.hcpss.org, accessed May 29, 2009  Wexler, Kathryn. "New Beginning For Old School; Rebuilt Wilde Lake Opens to Raves", The Washington Post, August 29, 1996, WEEKLY - MD; Pg. M01 The original high school was demolished in 1996 and a new one constructed.  The former design was oval and two stories, with a windowless doughnut layout with classroom clusters,  and a media center located in the center and accessible from the second level. Other schools in the Village of Wilde Lake include Bryant Woods, Running Brook, and Faulkner Ridge elementary schools, and Wilde Lake Middle School. RecreationThe Columbia Swim Center, which contains three indoor pools and a water slide called "Splashdown," is located in the village center.   There are also outdoor pools in each neighborhood. The walking path around the   lake is   long. References NotesMitchell, Joseph Rocco and Stebenne, David.

Sailing by way of St. Kitts, and St. Thomas, Maryland escorted a large convoy of American and British merchant vessels to safe waters, in addition to capturing Aerial, an American merchantman without papers, 2 September.She arrived Baltimore 1 October for repairs. Maryland departed Baltimore 22 March 1801 with Congressman John Dawson of Virginia, President Adams’ designated bearer of the amended and ratified Treaty of Mortefontaine with France, and arrived Havre de Grâce, France, in early May. The sloop remained until 15 July, when, because of difficulties in obtaining ratification, she was released by Congressman Dawson and sent home. Carrying several diplomatic passengers and important letters and dispatches, she returned to her home port Baltimore 28 August. Captain Rodgers discharged the crew and then sold Maryland 2 October 1801 for $20,200.References

Symbolism of the USS Maryland insigniaDark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the United States Navy. The arms of Maryland hail the state's historical roots, while the submarine indicates the present-day USS Maryland is an Ohio-class submarine. The trident represents U.S. Navy weaponry and sea prowess; its bottom spike points to the ocean depths, the area of Maryland s operations. The heraldic dolphins symbolize speed, intelligence, and the ability to penetrate the deep. The laurel wreath is emblematic of excellence and accomplishment; its seven stars commemorate both the seven battle stars that battleship   earned in World War II and that the state of Maryland was the seventh state to be admitted to the Union.SealMarylands coat of arms is emblazoned upon a white oval enclosed by a blue collar edged on the outside with gold rope and is inscribed in gold letters with the words "USS Maryland" above, and "SSBN-738" below.BlazonThe shield features the arms of the state of Maryland, which historically derives from the quartered arms of the Calvert and Crossland families. Its main color is blue, highlighted with silver. Beneath the shield is a scroll in blue, displaying the motto Timete Deum Solum et Ignominiam ("Fear Only God and Dishonor") inscribed in gold letters. This is all superimposed upon a trident wreathed in laurel decorated with seven stars. The trident's bottom spike is flanked by two dolphins.In popular cultureIn the 1994 Tom Clancy novel, Debt of Honor, Maryland is one of several submarines sent to deal with a Japanese invasion of the Northern Mariana Islands.In the 1998 television film Ice, Maryland is sent to evacuate VIPs from the frozen West Coast of the United States after the coastline has become ice-bound, preventing surface vessels from approaching the shore.References USS Maryland SSBN-738 Commissioning Booklet (1991)External links   USS Maryland (SSBN-738) command histories – Naval History & Heritage Command

Wicomico River (Maryland eastern shore)The Wicomico River   is a   U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011  tributary of the Chesapeake Bay on the eastern shore of Maryland. It drains an area of low marshlands and farming country in the middle Delmarva Peninsula. The name "Wicomico" derives from the words wicko mekee, meaning "a place where houses are built," apparently referring to an Indian town on the banks. The river is one of two in Maryland with this same name, along with the Wicomico River (a tributary of the Potomac River) in south central Maryland.It rises in northern Wicomico County, close to the Delaware state line, and flows generally southwest, through Salisbury, its head of navigation. It enters Monie Bay on the eastern edge of the Chesapeake Bay between Mt. Vernon and Waterview approximately   southwest of Salisbury. The lower   of the river form a tidal estuary.The gentle free-flowing river is a popular destination for recreational canoeing and kayaking, as well as recreational fishing. The river has also become a hot spot for water sports such as wake boarding and water skiing due to its consistently smooth surface. Barge traffic on the river has made Salisbury the primary shipping points for goods on the Delmarva Peninsula over the last several centuries. Two automobile cable ferries cross the river at the at Whitehaven and Upper Ferry.References External linksThe Wicomico River
