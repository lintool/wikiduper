Maryland         Maryland ( )  is a U.S. state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. Maryland was the seventh state to ratify the United States Constitution, and has three occasionally used nicknames: the Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State.Maryland is one of the smallest states in terms of area, but it remains one of the most populous and the most densely populated states of the United States.  The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis.  The state is named after Queen Henrietta Maria.   Of the 50 U.S. states, Maryland has the highest median household income, making it the wealthiest state in the nation. Ethnically, the majority of Marylanders are of German and Irish descent, though the state has a large group of African Americans. Geography Physical geography  Maryland has an area of   and is comparable in overall area with the European country of Belgium ( ).  It is the 42nd largest/9th smallest state, and is closest in size to Hawaii ( ), the next smallest state. The next largest state, Maryland's neighbor West Virginia, is almost twice the size of Maryland ( ).Maryland possesses a variety of topography, contributing to its nickname, "America in Miniature."  It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forest in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the mountains to the west.    Maryland is bounded on its north by Pennsylvania, on its west by West Virginia, on its east by Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean, and on its south, across the Potomac River, by West Virginia and Virginia. The mid-portion of this border is interrupted on the Maryland side by Washington, D.C., which sits on land that was originally part of Maryland and Montgomery and Prince George's Counties north of the Potomac River, and including the town of Georgetown, Maryland and was ceded to the Federal Government in 1790 to form the District of Columbia along with a part from Virginia south of the Potomac, including the town of Alexandria, Virginia (Virginia retro-ceded its portion which was returned in the 1840s).  The Chesapeake Bay nearly bisects the state, and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the Eastern Shore.  Most of the state's waterways are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western Garrett County (drained by the Youghiogheny River as part of the watershed of the Mississippi River), the eastern half of Worcester County (which drains into Maryland's Atlantic coastal bays), and a small portion of the state's northeast corner (which drains into the Delaware River watershed). So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the Bay State, a nickname that has actually been used by Massachusetts for a long time.The highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of  , is Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain, in the southwest corner of Garrett County, near the border with West Virginia and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River.  Close to the small town of Hancock, in western Maryland, about two-thirds of the way across the state, there is   between its borders. This geographical curiosity makes Maryland the narrowest state,  bordered by the Mason-Dixon Line to the north, and the northwards-arching Potomac River to the south.Portions of Maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions. For example, the Delmarva Peninsula is composed of the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland, the entire state of Delaware, and the two counties that make up the Eastern Shore of Virginia, whereas the westernmost counties of Maryland are considered part of Appalachia. Much of the Baltimore–Washington corridor lies just south of the Piedmont in the Coastal Plain,  though it straddles the border between the two regions.A quirk of the geography of Maryland is the absence of any natural lakes,  though there are numerous ponds. During the latter Ice Ages, the glaciers did not reach as far south as Maryland, and therefore they did not carve out the deep natural lakes that exist in states farther north. There are numerous man-made lakes, the largest of these being the Deep Creek Lake, a reservoir in Garrett County in westernmost Maryland. The lack of a glacial history also accounts for Maryland's soil, which is sandier and muddier than the rocky soils farther to the north and northeast. Human geography  The majority of Maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding Washington, D.C., and also in and around Maryland's most populous city, Baltimore. Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the Fall Line, the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and/or waterfalls. Maryland's capital city, Annapolis, is one exception to this pattern, since it lies along the banks of the Severn River, close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay.The other population centers of Maryland include suburban areas of Columbia and Ellicott City in Howard County; Silver Spring, Rockville, and Gaithersburg in Montgomery County; Laurel, College Park, Greenbelt, Hyattsville, Landover, Clinton, Bowie, and Upper Marlboro in Prince George's County; Frederick in Frederick County; Hagerstown in Washington County; Waldorf in Charles County; Pikesville, Essex, and Towson in Baltimore County; and Glen Burnie and Hanover in Anne Arundel.The eastern, southern, and western portions of the state tend to be more rural, although they are dotted with cities of regional importance such as Salisbury and Ocean City on the Eastern Shore, Lexington Park and Waldorf in Southern Maryland, and Cumberland in Western Maryland. Maryland's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and Southern regions of the United States. Generally, rural Western Maryland between the West Virginian Panhandle and Pennsylvania has an Appalachian culture; the Southern and Eastern Shore regions of Maryland embody a Southern culture,  while densely populated Central Maryland—radiating outward from Baltimore and Washington, D.C.—has more in common with that of the Northeast.  The U.S. Census Bureau designates Maryland as one of the South Atlantic States, but it is commonly associated with the Mid-Atlantic States and/or Northeastern United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents.                ClimateMaryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to downslope winds.The eastern half of Maryland lies on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, with very flat topography and very sandy or muddy soil. This region has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with hot, humid summers and a short, mild to cool winter; it falls under USDA Hardiness zone 8a.    This region includes the cities of Salisbury, Annapolis, Ocean City, the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.Beyond this region lies the Piedmont, with average seasonal snowfall totals generally exceeding   and, as part of USDA Hardiness zones 7b and 7a,  temperatures below   are more common. From the Cumberland Valley on westward, the climate begins to transition to a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa). This region includes northern and western greater Baltimore, Westminster, Gaithersburg, Frederick, and Hagerstown.Farther into western Maryland, the higher elevations of Allegany County and Garrett County display more characteristics of the humid continental zone, due in part to elevation, and are more similar to that of south-central Pennsylvania, with Cumberland listed as one of the regional cities by Altoona's WTAJ weather center.  They fall under USDA Hardiness zones 6b and below. Precipitation in the state is characteristic of the East Coast. Annual rainfall ranges from   with more in higher elevations. Nearly every part of Maryland receives   per month of rain. Average annual snowfall varies from   in the coastal areas to over   in the western mountains of the state. Because of its location near the Atlantic Coast, Maryland is somewhat vulnerable to tropical cyclones, although the Delmarva Peninsula, and the outer banks of North Carolina to the south provide a large buffer, such that a strike from a major hurricane (category 3 or above) is not very likely but is not impossible. More often, Maryland might get the remnants of a tropical system which has already come ashore and released most of its wind energy. Maryland averages around 30–40 days of thunderstorms a year, and averages around six tornado strikes annually.   NOAA National Climatic Data Center. Retrieved on October 24, 2006.

A good dose of annual precipitation helps to support many types of plants, including seagrass and various reeds at the smaller end of the spectrum to the gigantic Wye Oak, a huge example of White oak, the state tree, which can grow in excess of   tall.Middle Atlantic coastal forests, typical of the southeastern Atlantic coastal plain, grow around Chesapeake Bay and on the Delmarva Peninsula. Moving west, a mixture of Northeastern coastal forests and Southeastern mixed forests cover the central part of the state. The Appalachian Mountains of western Maryland are home to Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. These give way to Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests near the West Virginia border.   Many foreign species are cultivated in the state, some as ornamentals, others as novelty species. Included among these are the Crape Myrtle, Italian Cypress, live oak in the warmer parts of the state,  and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state.  USDA plant hardiness zones in the state range from Zone 5 in the extreme western part of the state to 6 and 7 in the central part, and Zone 8 around the southern part of the coast, the bay area, and parts of metropolitan Baltimore. Invasive plant species, such as kudzu, tree of heaven, multiflora rose, and Japanese stiltgrass, stifle growth of endemic plant life.  Maryland's state  flower, the Black-eyed Susan, grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state.  The state insect, the Baltimore Checkerspot Butterfly, is not common as it is near the southern edge of its range.  435 species of birds have been reported from Maryland.    Fauna The state harbors a great number of deer, especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state, and overpopulation can become a problem from year-to-year.  Mammals can be found ranging from the mountains in the west to the central areas and include bears,   Maryland's Public Information Network Retrieved on 4-9-2008.  bobcats,     foxes, coyote,     raccoons, and otters. There is a population of rare   wild horses found on Assateague Island. Every year during the last week of July, wild horses are captured and waded across a shallow bay for sale at Chincoteague, Virginia. This conservation technique ensures the tiny island is not overrun by the horses.  The ponies and their sale were popularized by the children's book, Misty of Chincoteague. They are believed to be descended from horses who escaped from shipwrecks.The purebred Chesapeake Bay Retriever dog was bred specifically for water sports, hunting and search and rescue in the Chesapeake area.    In 1878 the Chesapeake Bay Retriever was the first individual retriever breed recognized by the American Kennel Club. Maryland's reptile and amphibian population is led by the Diamondback Terrapin turtle, which was adopted as the mascot of University of Maryland, College Park. The state is the territory of the Baltimore Oriole, which is the official state bird and mascot of the MLB team the Baltimore Orioles.  Environmental awarenessIn 2007, Forbes.com rated Maryland as the fifth "Greenest" state in the country behind three of the Pacific States and Vermont. Maryland ranks 40th in total energy consumption nationwide, and it managed less toxic waste per capita than all but six states in 2005.  In April 2007 Maryland joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—a regional initiative formed by all of the Northeastern states, Washington D.C., and three Canadian provinces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. EarthquakesEarthquakes in Maryland are infrequent due to its distance  from tectonic plates and seismic/earthquake zones. The earthquakes that do occur are small, but may be felt over wide areas.   The M5.8 Virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout Maryland. Buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage easily.  History  17th century In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore in the Irish House of Lords, fresh from his failure further north with Newfoundland's Avalon colony, applied to Charles I for a royal charter for what was to become the Province of Maryland. Calvert's interest in creating a colony derived from his Catholicism and his desire for the creation of a haven in the New World for Catholics. He wanted a share of fortunes, such as those made by the sale of the commodity tobacco in Virginia, and hoped to recoup some of the financial losses he had sustained in his earlier colonial venture in Newfoundland.      George Calvert died in April 1632, but a charter for "Maryland Colony" (in Latin, "Terra Maria") was granted to his son, Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Lord Baltimore, on June 20, 1632. The new colony was named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I of England.  The name recorded in the charter was phrased "Terra Mariae, anglice, Maryland". The English name was preferred over the Latin due in part to the undesired association of "Mariae" with the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana of the Inquisition.  To try to gain settlers, Maryland used what is known as the headright system, which originated in Jamestown. Settlers were given 50 acres of land for each person they brought into the colony, whether as settler, indentured servant or slave.On March 25, 1634, Lord Baltimore sent the first colonists into this area. Although most of the settlers were Protestants, Maryland soon became one of the few regions in the English Empire where Catholics held the highest positions of political authority. Maryland was also a key destination for transport of tens of thousands of English convicts to work as indentured servants.The royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania. The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. But the terms of the grant clearly indicate that Charles II and William Penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to New Castle, Delaware when it falls north of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682, which might have resolved the issue, was undermined by Penn's receiving the additional grant of what is now Delaware—which previously had been part of Maryland.    The dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century, carried on by the descendants of William Penn and Lord Baltimore—the Calvert family, which controlled Maryland, and the Penn family, which controlled Pennsylvania.  18th centuryThe conflict led to the Cresap's War (also known as the Conojocular War), a border conflict between Pennsylvania and Maryland, fought in the 1730s. Hostilities erupted in 1730 with a series of violent incidents prompted by disputes over property rights and law enforcement, and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737. The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A provisional agreement had been established in 1732. Negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. The agreement defined Maryland's border with what is now Delaware as well as Pennsylvania. The border between Maryland and Pennsylvania was defined as the line of latitude   south of the southernmost house of Philadelphia, a line now known as the  Mason-Dixon Line. Maryland's border with Delaware was based on a Transpeninsular Line and the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle.  After Virginia made Anglicanism the established religion in the colony, numerous Puritans migrated from Virginia to Maryland. They were given land for a settlement called Providence (now Annapolis).  In 1650, the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government and set up a new government that prohibited both Catholicism and Anglicanism. In March 1654, the 2nd Lord Baltimore sent an army under the command of Governor William Stone to put down the revolt, but his forces were decisively defeated by a Puritan army near Annapolis in what was to be known as the Battle of the Severn.  During the persecution of Catholics in the Puritan revolt, Protestants burned down all of the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. The Puritan revolt lasted until 1658, when the Calvert family regained control of the colony and re-enacted the Toleration Act. However, after England's "Glorious Revolution" of 1688, when William of Orange came to the throne and established the Protestant faith in England, Maryland outlawed Catholicism. This lasted until after the American Revolutionary War.  Many wealthy Catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy.St. Mary's City was the largest site of the original Maryland colony, and was the seat of the colonial government until 1708. St Mary's is now a historical site, with a small tourist center. In 1708, the seat of government was moved to Providence, which had been renamed Annapolis. The city was renamed in  1694 in honour of Anne then Princess of Denmark, later Queen of England and Scotland, which later in her reign formed Great Britain.Most of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as indentured servants, and had to serve a several years' term as laborers to pay for their passage.  In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed many unions. Mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662. During the colonial era, families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and African men. Many of the free black families migrated to Delaware, where land was cheaper. Paul Heinegg. Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware. Retrieved 15 February 2008.  As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, planters in Maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened. The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted first to the production of tobacco as the commodity crop.Maryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. On February 2, 1781, Maryland became the 13th state to approve the ratification of the Articles of Confederation which brought into being the United States as a united, sovereign and national state. It also became the seventh state admitted to the U.S. after ratifying the new Constitution. In December 1790, Maryland donated land selected by President George Washington to the federal government for the creation of the new national capital of Washington, D.C. The land was provided from Montgomery and Prince George's counties, as well as from Fairfax County and Alexandria in Virginia; however, the land donated by Virginia was later returned to that state by the District of Columbia retrocession. 19th century During the War of 1812, the British military attempted to capture the port of Baltimore, which was protected by Fort McHenry. It was during this bombardment that the Star Spangled Banner was written by Francis Scott Key.Influenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by Methodist and Quaker ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the twenty years after the Revolutionary War. This was a pattern across the Upper South, in which the free black population increased markedly from less than one percent before the war to 13.9 percent by 1810. By 1860 Maryland's free black population comprised 49.1% of the total of African Americans in the state. Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 81–82   This contributed to the state's remaining loyal to the Union during the American Civil War. In addition, Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks temporarily suspended the state legislature, and President Abraham Lincoln had many of its fire eaters arrested prior to its reconvening.  In 1861, Federal regular military units and state militia regiments arrived in the President Street Station (built 1849) east of the "Basin" (Inner Harbor) of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and marched through Baltimore, where they were attacked by an unruly mob. The incident was the first bloodshed in the Civil War and has been dubbed the "Baltimore riot of 1861". When the telegraph lines to Washington and an iron railbridge were destroyed by residents of Baltimore, the federal government was isolated in Washington D.C..  During the fighting between civilians and the soldiers from the 6th Massachusetts Regiment (mostly from Lowell, Lawrence, Stoneham, and Methuen) followed by the unarmed "Washington Brigade" of Pennsylvania state militia from Philadelphia (including the unit's band), several soldiers were hit by stones and a musket was fired. The soldiers were ordered to march at double time, and it became a running gun battle. Two Union soldiers were shot and killed, while two others, including Corporal Needham, were knocked from the ranks and beaten to death by the enraged mob. Eventually the Union troops reached the safety of Camden Street Station (built 1857/67) of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. President Abraham Lincoln promised to avoid having more Northern defenders march through Baltimore while getting to areas to protect the acutely endangered Federal Capital. This forced the majority of forces traveling to reinforce the National Capital to take a slow route by boat which Massachusetts militia Gen. Benjamin F. Butler (1818–1893) did several days later after hearing of the bloody reception in Baltimore by commandeering the P. W. & B. Railroad ferryboat "Harriet Lane"  at the Susquehanna River crossing between Perryville in Cecil County to Havre de Grace in Harford County. Avoiding the riotous city, he steamed down the Chesapeake Bay to anchor at night off the Naval Academy at Severn Point in Annapolis and landing his troops of Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island militia over the protests of Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks (1798–1865) after pulling the old Navy training ship frigate  USS Constitution ("Old Ironsides") further off the shore so that southern sympathizers couldn't attack it. Then recruiting some railroad workers and boilermakers among his soldiers, they rescued a small yard locomotive in the trainyards and pushed up the Annapolis Line of the B. & O. Railroad to Relay Junction near Ellicott City where it joined the Main Line going west to Harpers Ferry, Virginia or south to Washington. The Northern regiments shortly arrived in the station by the U.S. Capitol and camped that evening in the Rotunda under the still un-completed dome under construction tending to their wounded. An additional unit was sent up Pennsylvania Avenue to reinforce the White House where President Lincoln awaited with joy and relief.  Of the 115,000 men from Maryland who joined the military during the American Civil War, 85,000, or 77%, joined the Union army, while the remainder joined the Confederate Army. To help ensure Maryland's inclusion in the Union, Abraham Lincoln suspended several civil liberties, including the writ of habeas corpus, an act deemed illegal by the Maryland native, Chief Justice Roger Taney of the United States Supreme Court.Lincoln ordered U.S. troops to place artillery on Federal Hill to threaten the city of Baltimore, and helped ensure the election of a new pro-union governor and legislature. Lincoln ordered certain pro-South members of the state legislature and other prominent men jailed at Fort McHenry, including the Mayor of Baltimore, George William Brown. The grandson of Francis Scott Key was included in those jailed. Historians continue to debate the constitutionality of these actions taken during the crisis of wartime. The Thomas Viaduct, which crosses the Patapsco River on the B&O Railroad, was considered so strategically important that Union troops were assigned to guard it throughout the entirety of the war.Because Maryland remained in the Union, it was exempted from the abolition provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, which applied only to states in rebellion. In 1864 the state held a constitutional convention that culminated in the passage of a new state constitution. Article 24 of that document abolished slavery. In 1867, following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to freedmen, the state extended suffrage to non-white males. Demographics  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Maryland was 5,884,563 on July 1, 2012, a 1.9% increase since the 2010 United States Census.   As of 2006, Maryland has an estimated population of 5,615,727, which is an increase of 26,128, or 0.5%, from the prior year and an increase of 319,221, or 6.0%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 189,158 people (that is 464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 129,730 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,017 people.In 2006, 645,744 were counted as foreign born, which represents mainly people from Latin America and Asia. About 4.0% are undocumented (illegal) immigrants.  Maryland also has a large Korean American population.  In fact, 1.7% are Korean, while as a whole, almost 6.0% are Asian. Most of the population of Maryland lives in the central region of the state, in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area and Washington Metropolitan Area, both of which are part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The Eastern Shore is less populous and more rural, as are the counties of western and southern Maryland.The two counties of Western Maryland, Allegany and Garrett, are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia more than they do the rest of Maryland.The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Anne Arundel County and Howard County, in the unincorporated town of Jessup.  EthnicityIn terms of race and ethnicity, the state is 58.2% White (54.4% non-Hispanic White alone), 29.4% Black or African American, and 5.5% Asian. Hispanics and Latinos of any race make up 8.2% of the population.  The five largest reported ancestries in Maryland are German (15.7%), Irish (11.7%), English (9%), unspecified American (5.8%), and Italian (5.1%). In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Maryland's population as 17.8% African-American and 80.4% non-Hispanic White. As of 2011, 58.0% of Maryland's population younger than age 1 were minorities.   African-Americans form a sizable portion of the state's population – nearly 30% in 2010    – including many immigrants from Nigeria, particularly the Igbo tribe.  Although populous in most of the state, large concentrations of African-American population can be found in Baltimore City, Prince George's County, Charles County, Randallstown, and the southern Eastern Shore.Most of the Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland are populated by Marylanders of British ancestry, with the Eastern Shore traditionally Methodist and the southern counties Catholic. Western and northern Maryland have large German-American populations. Italians, Poles, Czechs and Greeks are centered mostly in the large city of Baltimore.  Hispanics are numerous in Hyattsville/Langley Park, Wheaton, Bladensburg, Riverdale Park, Gaithersburg and Highlandtown in East Baltimore.  Salvadorans are the largest Hispanic group in Maryland. Other Hispanic groups with significant populations in the state include Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. Though the Salvadoran population is more concentrated in the area around Washington, DC, and the Puerto Rican population is more concentrated in the Baltimore area, all other major Hispanic groups in the state are evenly dispersed between these two areas. Maryland has one of the most diverse Hispanic populations in the country, with significant populations from various Caribbean and Central American nations. Jews are numerous throughout Montgomery County and in Pikesville and Owings Mills northwest of Baltimore. Asian Americans are concentrated in the suburban counties surrounding Washington, D.C., especially evident by a Korean American and Taiwanese American community in Rockville and a Filipino American community in Fort Washington.  Amish/Mennonite communities are found in St. Mary's, Garrett, and Washington counties. Maryland has the fifth largest proportions of racial minorities in the country.        Largest cities, towns and places  ReligionMaryland was founded for the purpose of providing religious toleration of England's Roman Catholic minority. Nevertheless, Parliament later reversed that policy and discouraged the practice of Catholicism in Maryland. Due to immigration patterns, Catholics have not been a majority in Maryland since early Colonial times. Nonetheless, Catholicism is the largest single denomination in Maryland.As of the year 2000, the RCMS    reported that the second and third largest denominational groups in Maryland are Mainline Protestant, and Evangelical Protestant. The Catholic Church has the highest number of adherents in Maryland (at 952,389), followed by the United Methodist Church with 297,729 members reported. Judaism is the largest non-Christian religion with 241,000 adherents, or 4.3% of the total population.  The present religious composition of the state is shown below:     Religions in Maryland   Christian  Other  Roman Catholic 24%   Jewish 4%  Baptist 18% Other 3% Muslim 1%  Methodist 11%   Other Religions 1%  Lutheran 6%   Non-Religious 11%   other Protestant 21%      Despite the Protestant majority, Maryland has been prominent in U.S. Catholic tradition, partially because it was intended by George Calvert as a haven for English Catholics. Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U.S. (1789), and Emmitsburg was the home and burial place of the first American-born citizen to be canonized, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. Georgetown University, the first Catholic University, was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland.  The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States, and the Archbishop of Baltimore is, albeit without formal primacy, the United States' quasi-primate, and often a Cardinal. Economy   The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Maryland's gross state product in 2006 was US$257 billion.    However, Maryland has been using Genuine Progress Indicator, an indicator of well-being, to guide the state's development, rather than relying only on growth indicators like GDP.   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Maryland households are currently the wealthiest in the country, with a 2009 median household income of $69,272    which puts it ahead of New Jersey and Connecticut, which are second and third respectively. Two of Maryland's counties, Howard and Montgomery, are the third and tenth wealthiest counties in the nation respectively. Also, the state's poverty rate of 7.8% is the lowest in the country.    Per capita personal income in 2006 was US$43,500, 5th in the nation.As of March 2012, the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%. Maryland's economic activity is strongly concentrated in the tertiary service sector, and this sector, in turn, is strongly influenced by location. One major service activity is transportation, centered on the Port of Baltimore and its related rail and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.  Although the port handles a wide variety of products, the most typical imports are raw materials and bulk commodities, such as iron ore, petroleum, sugar, and fertilizers, often distributed to the relatively close manufacturing centers of the inland Midwest via good overland transportation. The port also receives several different brands of imported motor vehicles and is the number two auto port in the U.S. A second service activity takes advantage of the close location of the center of government in Washington, D.C. and emphasizes technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. In addition, many educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The Johns Hopkins University and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, white collar technical and administrative workers comprise 25% of Maryland's labor force, attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the Washington Metro Area where the federal government office employment is relatively high.Maryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial fishing, centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the blue crab, oysters, striped bass, and menhaden. The Bay also has uncounted millions of overwintering waterfowl in its many wildlife refuges. While not, strictly speaking, a commercial food resource, the waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen. Maryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and Piedmont zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, tomatoes, muskmelons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.Manufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20% of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at Sparrows Point, still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, bankruptcies, and company mergers. During World War II the Glenn L. Martin Company (now part of Lockheed Martin) airplane factory near Essex, MD employed some 40,000 people.Mining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some surprisingly near Washington, but these no longer exist.Baltimore City is the eighth largest port in the nation, and was at the center of the February 2006 controversy over the Dubai Ports World deal because it was considered to be of such strategic importance. The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs. TaxationMaryland imposes 5 income tax brackets, ranging from 2% to 6.25% of personal income.  The city of Baltimore and Maryland's 23 counties levy local "piggyback" income taxes at rates between 1.25% and 3.2% of Maryland taxable income. Local officials set the rates and the revenue is returned to the local governments quarterly. The top income tax bracket of 9.45% is the fifth highest combined state and local income tax rates in the country, behind New York City's 11.35%, California’s 10.3%, Rhode Island’s 9.9%, and Vermont’s 9.5%. Maryland's state sales tax is 6%. All real property in Maryland is subject to the property tax. Generally, properties that are owned and used by religious, charitable, or educational organizations or property owned by the federal, state or local governments are exempt. Property tax rates vary widely. No restrictions or limitations on property taxes are imposed by the state, meaning cities and counties can set tax rates at the level they deem necessary to fund governmental services. These rates can increase, decrease or remain the same from year to year. If the proposed tax rate increases the total property tax revenues, the governing body must advertise that fact and hold a public hearing on the new tax rate. This is called the Constant Yield Tax Rate process. BiotechnologyMaryland is a major center for life sciences research and development.  With more than 400 biotechnology companies located there, Maryland is the fourth-largest nexus in this field in the United States. Institutions and government agencies with an interest in research and development located in Maryland include the Johns Hopkins University, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, more than one campus of the University System of Maryland, Goddard Space Flight Center, the United States Census Bureau, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Celera Genomics company, Human Genome Sciences (HGS),the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), and MedImmune - recently purchased by AstraZeneca. TransportationThe Maryland Department of Transportation, headquartered in the Hanover area of unincorporated Anne Arundel County,   oversees transportation in the state. Roads  Maryland's Interstate highways include   of I-95, which enters the northeast portion of the state, goes through Baltimore, and becomes part of the eastern section of the Capital Beltway to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. I-68 runs   connecting the western portions of the state to I-70 at the small town of Hancock. I-70 enters from Pennsylvania north of Hancock and continues east for   to Baltimore, connecting Hagerstown and Frederick along the way.I-83 has   in Maryland and connects Baltimore to southern central Pennsylvania (Harrisburg and York, Pennsylvania). Maryland also has an   portion of I-81 that runs through the state near Hagerstown. I-97, fully contained within Anne Arundel County and the second shortest (17.6 miles) one- or two-digit Interstate highway which connects the Baltimore area to the Annapolis area. Hawaii has one that is shorter.There are also several auxiliary Interstate highways in Maryland. Among them are two beltways encircling the major cities of the region: I-695, the McKeldin (Baltimore) Beltway, which encircles Baltimore; and a portion of I-495, the Capital Beltway, which encircles Washington, D.C. I-270, which connects the Frederick area with Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia through major suburbs to the northwest of Washington, is a major commuter route and is as wide as fourteen lanes at points.Both I-270 and the Capital Beltway are currently extremely congested; however, the ICC or Intercounty Connector (MD 200) is hoped to alleviate some of the congestion over time. Construction of the ICC was a major part of the campaign platform of former Governor Robert Ehrlich, who was in office from 2003 until 2007, and of Governor Martin O'Malley, who succeeded him. I-595, which is concurrent with US 50 and US 301, is the longest unsigned interstate in the country and connects Prince George's County and Washington D.C. with Annapolis and the Eastern Shore via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.Maryland also has a state highway system that contains routes numbered from 2 through 999, however most of the higher-numbered routes are either not signed or are relatively short. Major state highways include Routes 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway/Solomons Island Road/Southern Maryland Blvd.), 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue/Southern Maryland Blvd./Patuxent Beach Road/St. Andrew's Church Road), 5 (Branch Avenue/Leonardtown Road/Point Lookout Road), 32, 45 (York Road), 97 (Georgia Avenue), 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway), 210 (Indian Head Highway), 235 (Three Notch Road), 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), 355 (Wisconsin Avenue/Rockville Pike/Frederick Road),  404 (Queen Anne Highway/ Shore Highway), and 650 (New Hampshire Avenue). Airports  Maryland's largest airport is Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (known as Friendship Airport from its construction in 1950 and  renamed in 2005 for Baltimore-born former and first African-American Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall). The only other airports with commercial service are at Hagerstown and Salisbury. The Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also serviced by the other two airports in the region, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Dulles International Airport, both in Northern Virginia.  The College Park Airport is the nation's oldest, founded in 1909, and is still utilized.  Wilbur Wright trained military aviators at this location.    Rail  Amtrak trains, including the high speed Acela Express serve Baltimore's Penn Station, BWI Airport, New Carrollton, and Aberdeen along the Washington D.C. to Boston Northeast Corridor. In addition, train service is provided to Rockville and Cumberland by Amtrak's Washington, D.C., to Chicago Capitol Limited.The Washington Metrobus and Metrorail system provides connections between Washington, D.C. and the surrounding counties of Montgomery and Prince George's, as well as BWI Airport provided by the Route B30. MTA Maryland is the largest private operator in the state. Situated in Baltimore and largely focused in central Maryland, portions of the Eastern Shore are served by commuter and express bus service. Baltimore's Light Rail and Metro Subway systems serve the densely populated inner-city and the surrounding suburbs. The commuter rail service, known as MARC, focuses on the connection of Washington Union Station to Baltimore, Perryville, Frederick and as far as Martinsburg, WV.Freight rail transport is handled principally by two Class I railroads, as well as several smaller regional and local carriers. CSX Transportation has more extensive trackage throughout the state, with  , CSX Transportation. Jacksonville, FL (2010). "CSX and Maryland."  followed by Norfolk Southern Railway. Major rail yards are located in Baltimore and Cumberland,  with an intermodal terminal (rail, truck and marine) in Baltimore. The B&O Railroad, which goes from Baltimore to Ohio, is one of the oldest railroads in North America. Shipping canalsThe Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is a   canal on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.  Law and government     The government of Maryland is conducted according to the state constitution. The government of Maryland, like the other 49 state governments, has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States.Power in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Maryland General Assembly is composed of the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate. Maryland's governor is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting. The legislature may not increase the governor's proposed budget expenditures. Unlike most other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland's counties.Most of the business of government is conducted in Annapolis, the state capital. Virtually all state and county elections are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four, in which the President of the United States is not elected – this, as in other states, is intended to divide state and federal politics.The judicial branch of state government consists of one united District Court of Maryland that sits in every county and Baltimore City, as well as 24 Circuit Courts sitting in each County and Baltimore City, the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over $30,000.00, all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings. The intermediate appellate court is known as the "Court of Special Appeals" and the state supreme court is the "Court of Appeals". The appearance of the judges of the Maryland Court of Appeals is unique; Maryland is the only state whose judges wear red robes.  Elections Since before the Civil War, Maryland's elections have been largely controlled by the Democrats, even as the party's platform has changed considerably in that time. State elections are dominated by Baltimore and the populous suburban counties bordering Washington, D.C.: Montgomery and Prince George's. Forty-three percent of the state's population resides in these three jurisdictions, each of which contain large, traditionally Democratic voting bloc(s): African Americans in Baltimore and Prince George's, federal employees in Prince George's and Montgomery, and postgraduates in Montgomery. The remainder of the state, particularly Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, is more supportive of Republicans.Maryland has supported the Democratic nominee in each of the last five presidential elections, by an average margin of 15.4%. In 1980, it was one of six states to vote for Jimmy Carter. In recent years, Maryland has been among the most reliable states for Democratic nominees. In 1992, Bill Clinton fared better in Maryland than any other state except his home state of Arkansas. In 1996, Maryland was Clinton's sixth best, in 2000 Maryland ranked fourth for Gore and in 2004 John Kerry showed his fifth best performance in Maryland.  In 2008, Barack Obama won the state's 10 electoral votes in 2008 with 61.9% of the vote to John McCain's 36.5%.While Republicans usually win more counties by piling up large margins in the west and east, they are usually swamped by the more densely populated and heavily Democratic Baltimore-Washington axis.  In 2008, for instance, McCain won 17 counties to Obama's six; Obama also carried Baltimore City.  While McCain won most of the western and eastern counties by margins of 2-to-1 or more, he was almost completely shut out in the larger counties surrounding Baltimore and Washington; every large county except Anne Arundel went for Obama. Both of Maryland's U.S. Senators and seven of its eight Representatives in Congress are Democrats, and Democrats hold a supermajority in the state Senate. The previous Governor, Robert Ehrlich, was the first Republican to be elected to that office in four decades, and after one term lost his seat to Baltimore Mayor Martin J. O'Malley, a Democrat.  Ehrlich ran again for Governor in 2010, losing again to O'Malley.U.S. Congressman Steny Hoyer (MD-5), a Democrat, was elected as Majority Leader for the 110th Congress of the House of Representatives, and 111th Congress, serving in that post from 2007 to 2011. His district covers parts of Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties, in addition to all of Charles, Calvert and St. Mary's counties in southern Maryland. The 2006 election brought no significant change in this pattern of Democratic dominance. After Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes announced that he was retiring, Democratic Congressman Benjamin Cardin defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor Michael S. Steele, with 55% of the vote, against Steele's 44%. The governorship was also a point of interest, as Republican incumbent Robert Ehrlich was defeated by Democratic challenger Martin O'Malley, the Mayor of Baltimore, 53% to 46%.While Maryland is a Democratic Party stronghold, perhaps its best known political figure is a Republican – former Governor Spiro Agnew, who served as United States Vice President under Richard Nixon. He was Vice President from 1969 to 1973, when he resigned in the aftermath of revelations that he had taken bribes while he was Governor of Maryland. In late 1973, a court found Agnew guilty of violating tax laws.In 2010 Republicans won control of most counties. The Democratic Party remained in control of eight county governments including Baltimore City.  Education Primary and secondary education  Public primary and secondary education in Maryland is overseen by the Maryland State Department of Education, which is headquartered in Baltimore.   The highest educational official in the state is the State Superintendent of Schools, who is appointed by the State Board of Education to a four-year term of office. The Maryland General Assembly has given the Superintendent and State Board autonomy to make educationally related decisions, limiting its own influence on the day to day functions of public education. Each county and county-equivalent in Maryland has a local Board of Education charged with running the public schools in that particular jurisdiction.The budget for education was $5.5 billion in 2009, representing about 40% of the state's general fund. Maryland has a broad range of private primary and secondary schools. Many of these are affiliated with various religious sects, including parochial schools of the Catholic Church, Quaker schools, Seventh-day Adventist schools, and Jewish schools. In 2003, Maryland law was changed to allow for the creation of publicly funded charter schools, although the charter schools must be approved by their local Board of Education and are not exempt from state laws on education, including collective bargaining laws.In 2008, the state led the entire country in the percentage of students passing Advanced Placement examinations. 23.4 percent of students earned passing grades on the AP tests given in May 2008. This marks the first year that Maryland earned this honor.  Three Maryland high schools (in Montgomery County) were ranked among the top 100 in the country based on these test scores.  Colleges and universities Maryland has several historic and renowned private colleges and universities, the most prominent of which is Johns Hopkins University, founded in 1876 with a grant from Baltimore entrepreneur Johns Hopkins.The first public university in the state is the University of Maryland, Baltimore, which was founded in 1807 and contains the University of Maryland's only public academic health, human services, and one of two law centers (the other being the University of Baltimore School of Law). Seven professional and graduate schools train the majority of the state's physicians, nurses, dentists, lawyers, social workers, and pharmacists.  The largest undergraduate institution in Maryland is the University of Maryland, College Park which was founded as the Maryland Agricultural College in 1856 and became a public land grant college in 1864. Towson University, founded in 1866, is the state's second largest university. Baltimore is home to the Maryland Institute College of Art. The majority of public universities in the state are affiliated with the University System of Maryland. Two state-funded institutions, Morgan State University and St. Mary's College of Maryland, as well as two federally funded institutions, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the United States Naval Academy, are not affiliated with the University System of Maryland.St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland and Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, both private institutions, are the two oldest colleges in the state, and are among the oldest in the country.  Other private institutions include Mount St. Mary's University, McDaniel College (formerly known as Western Maryland College), Hood College, Stevenson University (formerly known as Villa Julie College), Loyola University Maryland, and Goucher College, among others. Sports    With two major metropolitan areas, Maryland has a number of major and minor professional sports franchises. Two National Football League teams play in Maryland, the Baltimore Ravens in Baltimore City and the Washington Redskins in Landover. The Baltimore Colts represented the NFL in Baltimore from 1953 to 1983 before moving to Indianapolis.The Baltimore Orioles are the state's Major League Baseball franchise. The National Hockey League's Washington Capitals and the National Basketball Association's Washington Wizards formerly played in Maryland, until the construction of an arena in Downtown D.C. in 1997 (originally known as MCI Center, renamed Verizon Center in 2006).Maryland enjoys considerable historical repute for the talented sports players of its past, including Cal Ripken Jr. and Babe Ruth. In 2012, The Baltimore Sun published a list of Maryland's top ten athletes in the state's history. The list includes Ruth, Ripken, Johnny Unitas, Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Ray Lewis, Michael Phelps, Jimmie Foxx, Jim Parker, and Wes Unseld. Other professional sports franchises in the state include five affiliated minor league baseball teams, one independent league baseball team, the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team, two indoor football teams, and three low-level outdoor soccer teams. Maryland is also home to one of the three races in horse racing's annual Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes, which is run every spring at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.The official state sport of Maryland, since 1962, is jousting; the official team sport since 2004 is lacrosse.  The National Lacrosse Hall of Fame is located on the Johns Hopkins University campus in Baltimore. In 2008, intending to promote physical fitness for all ages, walking became the official state exercise. Maryland is the first state with an official state exercise.

Montgomery County, Maryland      Montgomery County is a county in the U.S. state of Maryland, situated just to the north of Washington, D.C., and southwest of the city of Baltimore. It is one of the most affluent counties in the United States,  and has the highest percentage (29.2%) of residents over 25 years of age who hold post-graduate degrees.  The county seat and largest municipality is Rockville; although the census-designated place of Germantown is more populous.  As of 2010 the population was 971,777.     Most of the county's residents live in unincorporated locales, the most populous of which are Silver Spring, Germantown and Bethesda, though the incorporated cities of Rockville and Gaithersburg are also large population centers. It is a part of both the Washington Metropolitan Area and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.As of 2008, Montgomery County is the second richest county in terms of per capita income in the state of Maryland. As of 2011, it is the 10th richest in the United States, with a median household income of $92,213.   EtymologyThe Maryland state legislature named Montgomery County after Richard Montgomery; the county was created from lands that had at one point or another been part of the Charles, Prince George's and Frederick Counties. The county's nickname of "MoCo" is derived from a contraction of "Montgomery" and "County". Economy  Montgomery County is an important business and research center. It is the epicenter for biotechnology in the Mid-Atlantic region. Montgomery County is the third largest biotechnology cluster in the USA, holding the principal cluster and companies of large corporate size in the state. Biomedical research is carried out by institutions including Johns Hopkins University's Montgomery County Campus (JHU MCC), and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Federal government agencies engaged in related work include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).Many large firms are based in the county, including Discovery Communications, Coventry Health Care, Lockheed Martin, Marriott International, Host Hotels & Resorts, Travel Channel, Ritz-Carlton, Robert Louis Johnson Companies (RLJ Cos), Choice Hotels, MedImmune, TV One, BAE Systems Inc, Hughes Network Systems and GEICO.Other U.S. federal government agencies based in the county include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).Downtown Bethesda and Silver Spring are the largest urban business hubs in the county; combined, they rival many major city cores. Top employersAccording to the County's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Montgomery County, Maryland Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, for the Year ended June 30, 2011  the top employers by number of employees in the county are:  # Employer  of Employees   1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 29,700  2 Montgomery County Public Schools 22,016  3 United States Department of Defense 12,690  4 Montgomery County 8,849  5 United States Department of Commerce 8,250  6 Marriott International 5,441  7 Adventist HealthCare 5,310  8 Lockheed Martin 4,745  9 Giant 3,842  10 Verizon 3,292   HistoryBefore European settlement, the land now known as Montgomery County was covered in a vast swath of forest crossed by the creeks and small streams that feed the Potomac and Patuxent rivers. A few small villages of the Piscataway, members of the Algonquian people, were scattered across the southern portions of the county. North of the Great Falls of the Potomac, there were few permanent settlements, and the Piscataway shared hunting camps and foot paths with members of rival peoples like the Susquehannocks and the Senecas.Captain John Smith of the English settlement at Jamestown was probably the first European to explore the area, during his travels along the Potomac River and throughout the Chesapeake region.  These lands were claimed by Europeans for the first time when George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore was granted the charter for the colony of Maryland by Charles I of England.  However, it was not until 1688 that the first tract of land in what is now Montgomery County was granted by the Calvert family to an individual colonist, a wealthy and prominent early Marylander named Henry Darnall. He and other early claimants had no intention of settling their families. They were little more than speculators, securing grants from the colonial leadership and then selling their lands in pieces to settlers. Thus, it was not until approximately 1715 that the first British settlers began building farms and plantations in the area. These earliest settlers were English or Scottish immigrants from other portions of Maryland, German settlers moving down from Pennsylvania, or Quakers who came to settle on land granted to a convert named James Brooke in what is now Brookeville. Most of these early settlers were small farmers, growing a variety of subsistence crops in addition to the region's main cash crop, tobacco. They transported the tobacco they grew to market through the Potomac River port of Georgetown.  Sparsely settled, the area's farms and taverns were nonetheless of strategic importance as access to the interior. General Edward Braddock's army traveled through the county on the way to its disastrous defeat at Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Like other regions of the American colonies, the region that is now Montgomery County saw protests against British taxation in the years before the American Revolution. Following the signing of the Declaration of Independence, representatives of the area helped to draft the new state constitution and began to build a Maryland free of proprietary control.  The new state legislature formed Montgomery County from lands that had at one point or another been part of Charles, Prince George's and Frederick Counties, naming it after General Richard Montgomery. The leaders of the new county chose as their county seat an area adjacent to Hungerford's Tavern near the center of the county, which later became Rockville.  The newly formed Montgomery County supplied arms, food and forage for the Continental Army during the Revolution, in addition to soldiers. In 1791, portions of Montgomery County, including Georgetown, were ceded to form the new District of Columbia, along with portions of Prince George's County, Maryland, as well as parts of Virginia that were later returned to Virginia.In 1828, construction on the C&O Canal commenced and was completed in 1850. Throughout the 19th century, agriculture dominated the economy in Montgomery County, with slaves playing a significant role. In the 1850s, crop production shifted away from tobacco and toward corn. Montgomery County was important in the abolitionist movement, with slave Josiah Henson, who wrote about his experiences in a memoir which became the basis for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). Josiah, the inspiration for the character "Uncle Tom", was a slave in the county and a slave cabin where he is believed to have spent time still stands at the end of a driveway off Old Georgetown Road.Until 1860, only private schools existed in Montgomery County. Initially, schools for European American students were built, and in 1872 schools for African-Americans were added.Like most of Maryland, the county's southern sympathies resulted in it being occupied by Union forces during the Civil War. In 1873, the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad opened, with a route between Washington, D.C., and Point of Rocks, Maryland. The railroad spurred development at Takoma Park, Kensington, Garrett Park and Chevy Chase. On July 1, 1997, Montgomery County annexed a portion of Prince George's County, after residents of Takoma Park, which spanned both counties, voted to be entirely within the more affluent Montgomery County. The county has a number of sites on the National Register of Historic Places.    GeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of  , of which   is land and   is water.  Montgomery County lies entirely inside the Piedmont plateau.  The topography is generally rolling.  Elevations range from a low of near sea level along the Potomac River to about 875 feet in the northernmost portion of the county north of Damascus.  Relief between valley bottoms and hilltops is several hundred feet. Adjacent jurisdictions  Frederick County (northwest) Howard County (northeast) Prince George's County (southeast) Washington, D.C.

It has four distinct seasons.  Hot, humid summers and chilly winters are the normal.  Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with annual totals averaging about 44 inches.  Thunderstorms are common during the summer months with about 35 days experiencing thunder in the average year. While heavier precipitation is more common with thunderstorms in the summer, this is the season when droughts are most frequent.  Summer precipitation is more variable than in winter.The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.  The average summer afternoon maximum is about 85 F with the morning minimums about 65 F.  In winter, the average maximum is about 43 F with the morning minimum about 28 F.  Extremes heat waves can produce temperatures around 100 F with extreme cold snaps dropping lows to 0 to -10 F.The average yearly snowfall for the county ranges from 21" in the southernmost extents to 32" across the northern portions where elevations are highest (850 ft. msl) in the Damascus area.  While infrequent, large snowstorms, called nor'easters (named for the northeast movement along the Atlantic Ocean coast and their strong winds blowing from the northeast) can sometimes paralyze the area. During the record snowy winter of 2009-2010, almost 100 inches of snow was officially reported by a National Weather Service observer in Damascus for the winter.  The depth of snow on the ground also reached a all-time historical record of 37 inches during that winter in February 2010. Demographics  At the 2010 census, there were 971,777 people residing in the county. The population density was  . In 2000, there were 334,632 housing units at an average density of  . 2010The ethnic makeup of the county, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, was the following:  49.3% non-Hispanic White 16.6% Black 13.9% Asian 0.4% Native American 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 4.0% Two or more races 6.9% Other races 17.0% Hispanic or Latino (5.4% Salvadoran, 1.5% Mexican, 1.2% Peruvian, 1.1% Guatemalan), of any race   2000In 2000, significant national ethnic groups included people of Irish (8.5%), German (8.1%), English (6.8%) and American (5.0%) ancestry according to Census 2000. The county also has a sizable Jewish population, and is home to an increasing number of affluent Indian-Americans, Armenian-Americans and Iranian-Americans.There were 324,565 households of which 35% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.2% were married couples living together, 10.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.9% were non-families. 24.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.19.25.4% of the population was under the age of 18, 6.9% from 18 to 24, 32.3% from 25 to 44, 24.2% from 45 to 64, and 11.2% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 92.1 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.1 males.Montgomery County has the tenth highest median household income in the United States, and the second highest in the state after Howard County as of 2011. The median household income in 2007 was $89,284 and the median family income was $106,093. Males had a median income of $66,415 versus $52,134 for females. The per capita income for the county was $43,073. About 3.3% of families and 4.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.6% of those under age 18 and 4.6% of those age 65 or over. Since the 1970s, the county has had in place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) zoning plan that requires developers to include affordable housing in any new residential developments that they construct in the county. The goal is to create socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build more housing and generate more revenue. Montgomery County was one of the first counties in the U.S. to adopt such a plan, but many other areas have since followed suit.

In 1948 voters approved a "Council-Manager" form of government, making Montgomery County the first home-rule county in Maryland. The first six-member council was elected in 1949.  Then in 1968, the voters approved a "County Executive-Council" form of government. That change formed an executive branch under the County Executive, and a legislative branch under a seven-member County Council. Instead of a County Manager, there was now a Chief Administrative Officer appointed by the County Executive. That went into effect in 1970, when the first seven-member County Council was elected.  Originally all of the council members were elected at large (that is, by all of the voters). Five members were required to reside in their council district. In November 1986, the voters amended the Charter to increase the number of Council seats in the 1990 election from seven to nine. Now five members are elected by the voters of their council district and four are elected at-large. Each voter may vote for five council members; four at-large and one from the district in which they reside. The Montgomery County Police Department provides county-wide law enforcement services.

Liquor control  Montgomery County maintains a monopoly on the sale of "hard liquor" alcoholic beverages, while beer and wine may be sold at independently owned stores and at a single location within the county for a store chain. This is similar to several U.S. states. The county is thus referred to as an alcoholic beverage control county. Cities and towns   This county contains the following incorporated municipalities:  3 Cities: Gaithersburg (incorporated 1878) Rockville (incorporated 1860) Takoma Park (incorporated 1890) 12 Towns: Barnesville (incorporated 1888) Brookeville (incorporated 1808) Chevy Chase (Town of) (incorporated 1918) Chevy Chase View (incorporated 1993) Chevy Chase Village (incorporated 1910; note that, despite its name, it is a town and not a village.) Garrett Park (incorporated 1898) Glen Echo (incorporated 1904) Kensington (incorporated 1894) Laytonsville (incorporated 1892) Poolesville (incorporated 1867) Somerset (incorporated 1906) Washington Grove (incorporated 1937) 4 Villages: Chevy Chase, Village of, Section 3 (incorporated 1982) Chevy Chase, Village of, Section 5 (incorporated 1982) Martin's Additions (incorporated 1985) North Chevy Chase (incorporated 1996) Though the three incorporated cities of Gaithersburg, Rockville and Takoma Park lie within its boundaries, the most urbanized areas in the county include such unincorporated areas as Bethesda and Silver Spring.Occupying a middle ground between incorporated and unincorporated areas are Special Tax Districts, quasi-municipal unincorporated areas created by legislation passed by the Maryland General Assembly.  They lack home rule authority and must petition the General Assembly for changes affecting the authority of the district. The four incorporated villages of Montgomery County and the town of Chevy Chase View were originally established as Special Tax Districts. Four Special Tax Districts remain in the county:  Drummond, Village of (1916) Friendship Heights and "The Hills" (1914) Oakmont (1918) Battery Park (1923)  Unincorporated areas are also considered as towns by many people and listed in many collections of towns, but they lack local government. Various organizations, such as the United States Census Bureau, the United States Postal Service, and local chambers of commerce, define the communities they wish to recognize differently, and since they are not incorporated, their boundaries have no official status outside the organizations in question. The Census Bureau recognizes the following census-designated places in the county:     Ashton-Sandy Spring (a combination of the communities of Ashton and Sandy Spring recognized as a unit by the Census Bureau) Aspen Hill Bethesda Brookmont Burtonsville Cabin John Calverton (This CDP is shared between Montgomery and Prince George's Counties.) Chevy Chase (Note that this is also the name of an incorporated town) Clarksburg Cloverly Colesville Damascus Darnestown Fairland Forest Glen Friendship Village (This CDP includes the Village of Friendship Heights.) Germantown Glenmont Hillandale (This CDP is shared between Montgomery and Prince George's Counties.) Kemp Mill Montgomery Village North Bethesda North Kensington North Potomac Olney Potomac Redland Rossmoor Silver Spring South Kensington Travilah Wheaton-Glenmont (a combination of the communities of Wheaton and Glenmont recognized as a unit by the Census Bureau) White Oak  Other unincorporated places:  Beallsville Boyds Derwood Dickerson Hyattstown   Transportation RoadsMontgomery County is approximately bisected northwest-southeast by Interstate 270, a connector linking Interstate 70 with Washington. I-270 divides in North Bethesda with its primary roadway connecting to the eastbound Capital Beltway (Interstate 495), and a spur connecting to southbound I-495 as it approaches Northern Virginia.  Another spur highway, Interstate 370, connects Interstate 270 with the Shady Grove Metro station.A fiercely- and long-contested east-west toll freeway, the Intercounty Connector (Maryland Route 200), also known as the ICC, links Interstate 370 and I-270 with U.S. 29; and Interstate 95 and eventually U.S. 1 in Laurel, Prince George's County.  The first portion of the freeway, from I-370 to Georgia Avenue, opened in February 2011, and is now open to I-95.Roughly paralleling 270 is Maryland Route 355, a surface street known for much of its length as Rockville Pike or simply "The Pike". In its southern reaches it is known as Wisconsin Avenue, while in the north it is known as Frederick Road, or Frederick Ave in Gaithersburg; in the northern half of Rockville (from Town Center north), it is named Hungerford Drive. Other major routes include Maryland Route 190 (River Road); Maryland Route 97 (Georgia Avenue); Maryland Route 650 (New Hampshire Avenue), Maryland Route 185 (Connecticut Avenue), Randolph Road/Montrose Road, Maryland Route 28 (Darnestown Road, Montgomery Avenue and Norbeck Road), and Maryland Route 27 (Father Hurley Blvd., Ridge Road).  U.S. Route 29 parallels the eastern border of the county; first as Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring, then Colesville Road, and thence as Columbia Pike through Burtonsville and into Howard County.The Montgomery County government has strongly supported the use of automated traffic enforcement on county roads.  In 2007 this county became the first jurisdiction in Maryland to introduce automated speed cameras on roads with speed limits up to 35 mph, issuing fines of $40 by mail.  Red light cameras with fines of $75 are also in use. A computer system coordinates the setting of 750 traffic lights. In 2009, the computer system failed for a brief period, causing considerable problems.  BusMontgomery County operates its own bus public transit system, known as Ride On. Major routes are also covered by WMATA's Metrobus service. RailMontgomery County is served by three passenger rail systems.Amtrak, the U.S. national passenger rail system, operates its Capitol Limited to Rockville, between Washington Union Station and Chicago Union Station.The Brunswick line of the MARC commuter rail system makes stops at Silver Spring, Kensington, Garrett Park, Rockville, Washington Grove, Gaithersburg, Metropolitan Grove, Germantown, Boyds, Barnesville, and Dickerson, where the line splits into its Frederick and Martinsburg branches.Both suburban arms of the Red Line of the Washington Metro serve Montgomery County. It follows the CSX right of way to the west, roughly paralleling Route 355 from Friendship Heights to Shady Grove. The eastern side runs between the two tracks of the CSX right of way from Washington Union Station to Silver Spring, and roughly parallels Georgia Avenue, from Silver Spring to Glenmont.There has been much debate on the construction of two new transitways, both of which are still in the early stages of design.  The Purple Line would run "cross-town" connecting nodes in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties near the Beltway; and the Corridor Cities Transitway would provide an extension of the Red Line corridor from Gaithersburg to Germantown and beyond. AirThe Montgomery County Airpark (FAA GAI, ICAO KGAI), a general aviation facility in Gaithersburg, is the major airport in the county.  Davis Airport (FAA Identifier W50), a privately owned airstrip, is located in Laytonsville on Hawkins Creamery Road.  Commercial air service is provided at the nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National, Washington Dulles International, and BWI Airports. EducationElementary and secondary public schools are operated by the Montgomery County Public Schools. The county is also served by Montgomery College, a public, open access community college. The county has no public university of its own, but the state university system does operate a facility called Universities at Shady Grove in Rockville that provides access to baccalaureate and Master's level programs from several of the state's public universities.MCPS operates under the jurisdiction of an elected Board of Education.

Rockville, Maryland   Rockville is a city located in the central region of Montgomery County, Maryland. It is the county seat and is a major incorporated city of Montgomery County and forms part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The 2010 United States Census tabulated the Rockville's population at 61,209, making it the third largest incorporated city in Maryland, behind Baltimore and Frederick. Rockville is the largest incorporated city in Montgomery County, Maryland, although the nearby census-designated place of Germantown is more populous. Rockville, along with neighboring Gaithersburg and Bethesda, is at the core of the Interstate 270 Technology Corridor which is home to numerous software and biotechnology companies as well as several federal government institutions. The city also has several upscale regional shopping centers and is one of the major retail hubs in Montgomery County. History  Situated in Piedmont region and crossed by three creeks (Rock Creek, Cabin John Creek, and Watts Branch), Rockville provided an excellent refuge for semi-nomadic Native Americans as early as 8000 BC. By the first millennium BC, a few of these groups had settled down into year-round agricultural communities that exploited the native flora, including sunflowers and marsh elder. By AD 1200, these early groups (dubbed Montgomery Indians by later archaeologists) were increasingly drawn into conflict with the Senecas and Susquehannocks who had migrated south from Pennsylvania and New York. Within the present-day boundaries of the city, six prehistoric sites have been uncovered and documented, and borne artifacts several thousand years old. By the year 1700, under pressure from European colonists, the majority of these original inhabitants had been driven away.The indigenous population carved a path on the high ground, known as Sinequa Trail, which is now downtown Rockville. Later, the Maryland Assembly set the standard of 20 feet for main thoroughfares and designated the Rock Creek Main Road or Great Road to be built to this standard. In the mid-18th century, Lawrence Owen opened a small inn on the road. The place, known as Owen's Ordinary, took on greater prominence when, on April 14, 1755, Major General Edward Braddock stopped at Owen's Ordinary on a start of a mission from George Town (now Washington, D.C.) to press British claims of the western frontier.  The location of the road, near the present Rockville Pike, was strategically located on higher ground making it dry year-round.    The first land patents in the Rockville area were obtained by Arthur Nelson between 1717 and 1735. Within three decades, the first permanent buildings in what would become the center of Rockville were established on this land. Still a part of Prince George's County at this time, the growth of Daniel Dulaney's Frederick Town prompted the separation of the western portion of the county, including Rockville, into Frederick County in 1748.Being a small, unincorporated town, early Rockville was known by a variety of names, including Owen's Ordinary, Hungerford's Tavern, and Daley's Tavern. The first recorded mention of the settlement which would later become known as Rockville dates to the Braddock Expedition in 1755. On April 14, one of the approximately two thousand men who were accompanying General Braddock through wrote the following: "we marched to larance Owings or Owings Oardianary, a Single House, it being 18 miles and very dirty." Owen's Ordinary was a small rest stop on Rock Creek Main Road (later the Rockville Pike), which stretched from George Town to Frederick Town, and was then one of the largest thoroughfares in the colony of Maryland. On September 6, 1776, the Maryland Constitutional Convention agreed to a proposal introduced by Thomas Sprigg Wootton wherein Frederick County, the largest and most populous county in Maryland, would be divided into three smaller units. The southern portion of the county, of which Rockville was a part, was named Montgomery County. The most populous and prosperous urban center in this new county was George Town, but its location at the far southern edge rendered it worthless as a seat of local government. Rockville, a small, but centrally located and well-travelled town, was chosen as the seat of the county's government. Thereafter, the village was referred to by all as Montgomery Court House. In 1784, William Prather Williams, a local landowner, hired a surveyor to lay out much of the town. In his honor, many took to calling the town Williamsburgh. In practice, however, Williamsburgh and Montgomery Court House were used interchangeably. Rockville came to greater prominence when Montgomery county was created and later when George Town was ceded to the federal government to create the District of Columbia. On July 16, 1803, when the area was officially entered into the county land records, however, the name used was "Rockville," believed to be derived from Rock Creek.  Nevertheless, the name Montgomery Court House continued to appear on maps and other documents through the 1820s.By petition of Rockville's citizens, the Maryland General Assembly incorporated the village on March 10, 1860. During the American Civil War, General George B. McClellan stayed at the Beall Dawson house in 1862. In addition, General J.E.B. Stuart and an army of 8,000 Confederate cavalrymen marched through and occupied Rockville on June 28, 1863 while on their way to Gettysburg and stayed at the Prettyman house. Jubal Anderson Early had also crossed through Maryland, on his way to and from his attack on Washington.  A monument to the Confederate soldier is hidden behind the old courthouse building   or.   The monument was dedicated on June 3, 1913 at a cost of $3,600.In 1873, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad arrived, making Rockville easily accessible from Washington, D.C. (See Metropolitan Branch.) In July 1891, the Tennallytown and Rockville Railway inaugurated Rockville's first trolley service connecting to the Georgetown and Tennallytown Railway terminus at Western Avenue and Wisconsin Avenue.  This provided service from Georgetown to Rockville, connecting Rockville to Washington, D.C. by trolley. Trolley service operated for four decades, until, eclipsed by the growing popularity of the automobile, service was halted in August 1935. The Blue Ridge Transportation Company provided bus service for Rockville and Montgomery County from 1924 through 1955. After 1955, Rockville would not see a concerted effort to develop a public transportation infrastructure until the 1970s, when the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) began work to extend the Washington Metro into Rockville and extended Metrobus service into Montgomery County. The Rockville station of Washington Metro began service on July 25, 1984, and the Twinbrook station began service on December 15, 1984. Metrobus service was supplemented by Montgomery County's own Ride On bus service starting in 1979. MARC, Maryland's Rail Commuter service, serves Rockville with its Brunswick line. From Rockville MARC provides service to Union Station in Washington D.C. (southbound) and, Frederick and Martinsburg, West Virginia (northbound), as well as intermediate points. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service from Rockville to Chicago and Washington D.C.During the Cold War, it was considered safer to remain in Rockville than to evacuate during a hypothetical nuclear attack on Washington, D.C. Bomb shelters were built, including the largest one at Glenview Mansion and 15 other locations. The I-270 highway was designated as an emergency aircraft landing strip. Two Nike missile launcher sites were located on Muddy Branch and Snouffer School Roads until the mid-1970s.  From the 1960s, Rockville's town center, formerly one of the area's commercial centers, suffered from a period of decline. Rockville soon became the first city in Maryland to enter into a government funded urban renewal program. This resulted in the demolition of most of the original business district. Included in the plan was the unsuccessful Rockville Mall, which failed to attract either major retailers or customers and was demolished in 1994, various government buildings such as the new Montgomery County Judicial Center, and a reorganization of the road plan near the Courthouse. Unfortunately, the once-promising plan was for the most part a disappointment. Although efforts to restore the town center continue, the majority of the city's economic activity has since relocated along Rockville Pike (MD Route 355/Wisconsin Avenue). In 2004, Rockville Mayor Larry Giammo announced plans to renovate the Rockville Town Square, including building new stores and housing and relocating the city's library. In the past year, the new Rockville Town Center has been transformed and includes a number of boutique-like stores, restaurants, condominiums and apartments, as well as stages, fountains and the Rockville Library.  The headquarters of the U.S. Public Health Service is on Montrose Road while the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's headquarters is just south of the City's corporate limits.The city is closely associated with the neighboring towns of Kensington and the unincorporated census-designated place, North Bethesda. The Music Center at Strathmore, an arts and theater center, opened in February 2005 in the latter of these two areas and is presently the second home of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, and the Fitzgerald Theatre in Rockville Civic Center Park has provided diverse entertainment since 1960. In 1998, Regal Cinemas opened in Town Center.  . The city also has a brass band in the British style. The REM song (Don't Go Back To) Rockville released in 1984 was written by Mike Mills about not wanting his girlfriend to return to Rockville, Maryland. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.    DemographicsIn addition to North Potomac, MD with a 27.59% Asian population and Potomac, MD with close to 15%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Rockville is home to one of the largest Chinese communities in Maryland.   According to the U.S. Census conducted in 2000, 14.5% of North Potomac's residents identified themselves as being of Chinese ancestry, making North Potomac the area with the highest percentage of Chinese ancestry in any place besides California and Hawaii.  According to the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) enrollment demographic statistics, the two high schools in Montgomery County with the highest reported Asian ancestry are Thomas S. Wootton High School in Rockville, MD with a 32.1% Asian population and caters to the communities in North Potomac, Rockville, and Potomac, MD, and Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, MD with a 23.0% Asian population.     Although North Potomac and Potomac have the highest concentration of Asian population in Maryland, the areas are largely residential and consist of suburban subdivisions. Thus, the more commercially favorable Rockville has become the center for Chinese/Taiwanese businesses since it is the county seat of Montgomery County and has large economic activity along Rockville Pike/Wisconsin Avenue (MD Route 355) in addition to having its own middle class and upscale residential areas.  Rockville is widely considered to be a "Little Taipei" due to the area's high concentration of Taiwanese immigrants. Rockville is also the center of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area's Jewish population, containing several synagogues, kosher restaurants, and the largest of the Washington area's three Jewish community centers, part of a complex which includes a Jewish nursing home, day school, theater, and educational facility. There are also high percentages of Jewish population in the surrounding areas of North Potomac and Potomac, which are largely residential and not as commercially suitable as Rockville. The city also has large Korean and Indian populations. The median income for a household in the city as of 2007 is $86,085. As of 2007, the median income for a family was $98,257.    Males have a median income of $53,764 versus $38,788 for females. The per capita income for the city is $30,518. 7.8% of the population and 5.6% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 8.9% of those under the age of 18 and 7.9% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line. 2010 censusAs of the census    of 2010, there were 61,209 people, 23,686 households, and 15,524 families residing in the city. The population density was  . There were 25,199 housing units at an average density of  . The racial makeup of the city was 60.4% White (52.8% non-Hispanic white), 9.6% African American, 0.3% Native American, 20.6% Asian, 5.3% from other races, and 3.8% from two or more races.

Bethesda, Maryland          Bethesda is a census-designated place in southern Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, just northwest of Washington, D.C. It takes its name from a local church, the Bethesda Meeting House (1820, rebuilt 1849), which in turn took its name from Jerusalem's Pool of Bethesda.  (In Aramaic, בית חסדא beth ḥesda means "House of Mercy" and in Hebrew, בית חסד "beit ḥesed" means "House of Kindness".) The National Institutes of Health main campus and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center are in Bethesda, as are a number of corporate and government headquarters.Bethesda is one of the most affluent and highly educated communities in the country, placing first in Forbes list of America's most educated small towns  and first on CNNMoney.com's list of top-earning American towns.  In April 2009, Forbes ranked Bethesda second on its list of "America's Most Livable Cities."  In October 2009, based on education, income, health, and fitness, Total Beauty ranked Bethesda first on its list of the U.S.'s "Top 10 Hottest-Guy Cities." As an unincorporated area, Bethesda has no official boundaries. The United States Census Bureau defines a Census-Designated Place named Bethesda whose center is located at 38°59' North, 77°7' West. The United States Geological Survey has defined Bethesda as an area whose center is at  , slightly different from the Census Bureau's definition. Other definitions are used by the Bethesda Urban Planning District, the United States Postal Service (which defines Bethesda to comprise the zip codes 20810, 20811, 20813, 20814, 20815, 20816, and 20817), and other organizations. According to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010, the community had a total population of 60,858. Most of Bethesda's residents are in Maryland Legislative District 16. HistoryBethesda is situated along a major thoroughfare that was originally the route of an ancient Native American trail. Between 1805 and 1821, it was developed into a toll road called the Washington and Rockville Turnpike, which carried tobacco and other products between Georgetown and Rockville, and north to Frederick. A small settlement grew around a store and tollhouse along the turnpike. By 1862, the community was known as "Darcy's Store" after the owner of a local establishment, William E. Darcy. The settlement was renamed in 1871 by the new postmaster, Robert Franck, after the Bethesda Meeting House, a Presbyterian church built in 1820 on the present site of the Cemetery of the Bethesda Meeting House. The church burnt in 1849 and was rebuilt the same year about 100 yards south at its present site.   Throughout most of the 19th century, Bethesda was a small crossroads village, consisting of a post office, a blacksmith shop, a church and school, and a few houses and stores. It was not until the installation of a streetcar line in 1890 and the beginnings of suburbanization in the early 1900s that Bethesda began to grow in population. Subdivisions began to appear on old farmland, becoming the neighborhoods of Drummond, Woodmont, Edgemoor, and Battery Park. Further north, several wealthy men made Rockville Pike famous for its mansions. These included Brainard W. Parker ("Cedarcroft", 1892), James Oyster ("Strathmore", 1899), George E. Hamilton ("Hamilton House", 1904; now the Stone Ridge School), Luke I. Wilson ("Tree Tops", 1926), Gilbert Grosvenor ("Wild Acres", 1928–29), and George Freeland Peter ("Stone House", 1930). In 1930, Dr Armistead Peter's pioneering manor house "Winona" (1873) became the clubhouse of the original Woodmont Country Club (on land that is now part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus). Merle Thorpe's mansion, "Pook's Hill" (1927, razed 1948) — on the site of the current neighborhood of the same name — became the home-in-exile of the Norwegian Royal Family during World War II. That war, and the expansion of government that it created, further fed the rapid expansion of Bethesda. Both the National Naval Medical Center (1940–42) and the NIH complex (1948) were built just to the north of the developing downtown. This, in turn, drew further government contractors, medical professionals, and other businesses to the area. In recent years, Bethesda has consolidated as the major urban core and employment center of southwestern Montgomery County.   This recent growth has been significantly vigorous following the expansion of Metrorail with a station in Bethesda in 1984. Alan Kay built the Bethesda Metro Center over the Red line metro rail which opened up further commercial and residential development around the surrounding vicinity. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of  .   of it is land and   of it (0.38%) is water.The main commercial corridor that runs through Bethesda is Maryland Route 355 (known as Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda and as Rockville Pike and Hungerford Drive in more northern communities), which, to the north, connects Bethesda with the communities of North Bethesda and Rockville, ending, after several name changes, in Frederick, Maryland. Toward the South, Rockville Pike becomes Wisconsin Avenue near the NIH Campus and continues beyond Bethesda through Chevy Chase, Friendship Heights, Maryland and into Washington, DC, ending in Georgetown.The area commonly known as "Downtown Bethesda" is centered at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue, Old Georgetown Road and East-West Highway.  Other focal points of downtown Bethesda include the Woodmont Triangle, bordered by Old Georgetown Road (Maryland Route 187), Woodmont and Rugby Avenues, and the Bethesda Row, centered at the intersection of Woodmont Avenue and Bethesda Avenue.   Much of the dense construction in that area followed the opening of the Bethesda station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro rapid transit system, also located at this intersection and the centerpiece of the Bethesda Metro Center development.  The Medical Center Metro stop lies about 0.7 miles north of the Bethesda stop, Medical Center, which serves the NIH Campus, the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

Silver Spring, Maryland  Silver Spring is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It had a population of 71,452 at the 2010 census, making it the fourth most populous place in Maryland, after Baltimore, Columbia, and Germantown. The urbanized, oldest, and southernmost part of Silver Spring is a major business hub that lies at the north apex of Washington, D.C. As of 2004, the Central Business District (CBD) held   of office space, 5216 dwelling units and   of parkland. The population density of this CBD area of Silver Spring was 15,600 per square mile all within   and approximately   in the CBD/downtown area.  The community has recently undergone a significant renaissance, with the addition of major retail, residential, and office developments.Silver Spring takes its name from a mica-flecked spring discovered there in 1840 by Francis Preston Blair, who subsequently bought much of the surrounding land. Acorn Park, tucked away in an area of south Silver Spring away from the main downtown area, is believed to be the site of the original spring.  Geography As an unincorporated area, Silver Spring's boundaries are not officially defined. As of the 2010 Census the United States Census Bureau defines Silver Spring as a census-designated place with a total area of  , all land; however, it does contain numerous creeks and small lakes. This definition is a 15% reduction from the 9.4 sq. mi. used in previous years. The United States Geological Survey locates the center of Silver Spring at  , notably some distance from the Census Bureau's datum. By another definition, Silver Spring is located at   (39.004242, -77.019004).  The definitions used by the Silver Spring Urban Planning District, the United States Postal Service, the Greater Silver Spring Chamber of Commerce, etc., are all different, each defining it for its own purposes.Residents of a large swath of south-eastern Montgomery County have Silver Spring mailing addresses. This area extends roughly from the Washington, D.C., Prince George's County, Maryland and Howard County, Maryland lines to the south, east and north, and Rock Creek Park and Plyers Mill Road to the west and north-west. These boundaries make Silver Spring larger in area than any city in Maryland except for Baltimore. Some notable landmarks are the world headquarters of Discovery Communications, the AFI Silver Theatre, the NOAA headquarters, and the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.   Parks and recreation Rock Creek Park passes along the west side of Silver Spring, and offers hiking trails, picnic grounds, and bicycling on weekends, when its main road, Beach Drive, is mostly closed to motor vehicles.Sligo Creek Park follows Sligo Creek through Silver Spring; it offers hiking trails, tennis courts, playgrounds and bicycling. The latter is facilitated on weekends, when parts of Sligo Creek Parkway are closed to autos. The bike trails are winding and slower than most in the region. Recently, rocks have been spread along either side of the road, providing a hazardous bike ride, or skating leisure.Acorn Park in the downtown area of Silver Spring is believed to be the site of the eponymous "silver spring".The   Jesup Blair Park was recently renovated and has a soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts, and picnic area. Brookside Gardens is a   park within Wheaton Regional Park, in "greater" Silver Spring. It is located on the original site of Stadler Nursery (now in Laytonsville, Maryland). Demographics  2010Note: For the 2010 Census the boundaries of the Silver Spring CDP were changed reducing the land area by approx. 15%. As a result, the population count for 2010 shows a 6.6% decrease, while the population density increases 11%. As of the 2010 census, there were 71,452 people, 28,603 households, and 15,684 families residing in the Silver Spring CDP. The population density was 9,021.7 people per square mile (3,485.5/km²). There were 30,522 housing units at an average density of 3,853.8 per square mile (1,488.9/km²).

Hispanic or Latino people of any race consist of 26.3% of the population. Like  much of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, Silver Spring's Hispanic population is mostly made up of Salvadorans and other immigrants from Central America.There were 28,603 households out of which 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.6% were married couples living together, 11.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.2% were non-families. Thirty-three point six percent (33.6%) of all households are made up of individuals living alone and 16.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.21.In the census area, the population was spread out with 21.4% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 37.1% from 25 to 44, 23.8% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.8 years. For every 100 females there were 94.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.2 males.The median income for a household in the census area was $62,187, and the median income for a family was $77,541. Males had a median income of $46,407 versus $49,979 for females.

History  Nineteenth centuryThe Blair, Lee, and Jalloh and Barrie families, three politically active families of the time, are irrefutably tied to Silver Spring's history. In 1840, Francis Preston Blair, who later helped organize the modern American Republican Party, along with his daughter, Elizabeth, discovered a spring flowing with chips of mica (the now-dry spring is still visible at Acorn Park). Two years later, he completed a twenty-room mansion he dubbed Silver Spring on a 250 acre (one-square-kilometer) country homestead situated just outside of Washington, D.C. (The house stood until 1954. ) By 1854, Blair's son, Montgomery Blair, who became Postmaster General under Abraham Lincoln and represented Dred Scott before the United States Supreme Court, built the Falkland house in the area. By the end of the decade, Elizabeth Blair married Samuel Phillips Lee, third cousin of future Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, and gave birth to a boy, Francis Preston Blair Lee. The child would eventually become the first popularly elected Senator in United States history.During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln visited the Silver Spring mansion multiple times. During some of the visits he relaxed by playing town ball with Francis P. Blair's grandchildren.  In 1864, Confederate Army General Jubal Early occupied Silver Spring prior to the Battle of Fort Stevens. After the engagement, fleeing Confederate soldiers razed Montgomery Blair's Falkland residence. By the end of the 19th century, the region began to develop into a town of decent size and importance. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's Metropolitan Branch was completed in 1873 and ran from Washington, D.C. to Point of Rocks, Maryland through Silver Spring. The first suburban development appeared in 1887 when Selina Wilson divided part of her farm on current-day Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and Brookeville Road into five- and ten-acre (20,000- and 40,000 m²) plots. In 1893, Francis Preston Blair Lee and his wife, Anne Brooke Lee, gave birth to E. Brooke Lee, who is known as the father of modern Silver Spring for his visionary attitude toward developing the region.  Twentieth centuryThe early 20th century set the pace for downtown Silver Spring's growth. E. Brooke Lee and his brother, Blair Lee I, founded the Lee Development Company, whose Colesville Road office building remains a downtown fixture. Dale Drive, a winding roadway, was built to provide vehicular access to much of the family's substantial real estate holdings. Suburban development continued in 1922 when Woodside Development Corporation created Woodside Park, with 1 acre (4,000 m²) plot home sites. In 1924, Washington trolley service on Georgia Avenue (present-day Maryland Route 97) across B&O's Metropolitan Branch was temporarily suspended so that an underpass could be built. The underpass was completed two years later, but trolley service never resumed. It would be rebuilt again in 1948 with additional lanes for automobile traffic, opening the areas to the north for readily accessible suburban development.Takoma-Silver Spring High School, built in 1924, was the first high school for Silver Spring. The community's rapid growth led to the need for a larger school. In 1935, when a new high school was built at Wayne Avenue and Sligo Creek Parkway, it was renamed Montgomery Blair High School. (The school remained at that location for over six decades, until 1998, when it was moved to a new, larger facility at the corner of Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and University Boulevard (Maryland Route 193). The former high school building became a combined middle school and elementary school.) The Silver Spring Shopping Center and Silver Theatre (designed by noted theatre architect John Eberson) were completed in 1938, at the request of developer William Alexander Julian. The shopping center was unique because it was one of the nation's first retail spaces that featured a street-front parking lot. Conventional wisdom held that merchandise should be in windows closest to the street so that people could see it; the shopping center broke those rules.By the 1950s, Silver Spring was the second busiest retail market between Baltimore and Richmond, with the Hecht Company, J.C. Penney, Sears, Roebuck and Company, and a number of other retailers. In 1954, after standing for over a century, the Blair mansion "Silver Spring" was razed and replaced with the Blair Station Post office. In 1960, Wheaton Plaza (later known as Westfield Wheaton), a shopping center several miles north of downtown Silver Spring opened, and captured much of the town's business. The downtown area soon started a long period of decline.In December 1961, a short segment of the Capital Beltway (I-495) was opened to traffic between Georgia Avenue (MD 97) and University Boulevard East (MD 193).   On Monday, August 17, 1964, the final segment of the   Beltway was opened to traffic,  and a ribboncutting ceremony was held near the New Hampshire Avenue interchange, with a speech by then-Gov. J. Millard Tawes. Washington Metro rail service into Washington, D.C. helped breathe life into the region starting in 1978 with the opening of the Silver Spring station. The Metro Red Line was built following the alignment of the B&O Metropolitan Branch, with the Metro tracks centered between the B&O's eastbound and westbound mains. The Red Line heads south to downtown DC from Silver Spring, running at grade before descending into Union Station.  By the mid-1990s, the Red Line continued north from the downtown Silver Spring core, entering a tunnel just past the Silver Spring station and running underground to three more stations, Forest Glen, Wheaton and Glenmont.Nevertheless, the decline continued in the 1980s, as the Hecht Company, downtown's last remaining department store, closed and opened a new store at Wheaton Plaza. Furthermore, Hecht's added a covenant forbidding another department store from renting its old spot. City Place, a multi-level mall, was established in the old Hecht Company building in 1992, but it had trouble attracting quality anchor stores and gained a reputation as a budget mall, anchored by Burlington Coat Factory and Marshalls, as well as now-closed anchors AMC Theaters, Gold's Gym, Steve and Barry's, and Nordstrom Rack. In the mid-1990s, developers considered building a mega-mall and entertainment complex called the American Dream (similar to the Mall of America) in downtown Silver Spring, but the revitalization plan fell through before any construction began because the developers were unable to secure funding.Another notable occurrence in Silver Spring during the 1990s was a 1996 train collision on the Silver Spring section of the Metropolitan line. On February 16 of that year, during the Friday-evening rush hour, a MARC commuter train bound for Washington Union Station collided with the Amtrak Capitol Limited train and erupted in flames on a snow-swept stretch of track in Silver Spring, leaving eleven people dead.The Maryland State Highway Administration started studies of improvements to the Capital Beltway in 1993,  and have continued, off and on, examining a number of alternatives (including HOV lanes and Express Toll Lanes) since then. Twenty-first century At the beginning of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to see the results of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were completely reconstructed to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called "Downtown Silver Spring." New shops included national retail chains such as Whole Foods Market, a 20-screen Regal Theatres, Men's Wearhouse, Ann Taylor Loft, DSW Shoe Warehouse, Office Depot, and Pier 1 Imports, as well as many restaurants, including Romano's Macaroni Grill, Panera Bread, Red Lobster, Cold Stone Creamery, Fuddruckers, Potbelly Sandwich Works, Baja Fresh, Nando's, and Chick-fil-a. A Borders book store was a popular spot until it closed when the chain went out of business. In addition to these chains, Downtown Silver Spring is home to a wide variety of family-owned restaurants representing its vast ethnic diversity. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a PBS documentary entitled Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb, released in 2002. In 2003, Discovery Communications completed the construction of its headquarters and relocated to downtown Silver Spring from nearby Bethesda. The same year also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as AFI Silver, under the auspices of the American Film Institute. Development continues with the opening of new office buildings, condos, stores, and restaurants, although City Place Mall continues to struggle to fill its vacancies despite the explosive growth around it. The restoration of the old B&O Passenger Station was undertaken between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film Next Stop: Silver Spring.    Beginning in 2004, the downtown redevelopment was marketed locally with the "silver sprung" advertising campaign, which declared on buses and in print ads that Silver Spring had "sprung" and was ready for business.  In June 2007, The New York Times noted that downtown was "enjoying a renaissance, a result of public involvement and private investment that is turning it into an arts and entertainment center". In 2007, the downtown Silver Spring area gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in what appeared to be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Cos., a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited.  In response, Montgomery County Attorney Leon Rodriguez said that the street in question, Ellsworth Drive, "constitutes a public forum" and that the First Amendment's protection of free speech applies there. In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, "Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, we think it is likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment."  The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.In 2008, construction of the long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC), which crosses the upper reaches of Silver Spring, got under way. The highway's first section opened on February 21, 2011; the entire route was completed by 2012.In July 2010, the Silver Spring Civic Building and Veterans Plaza opened in downtown Silver Spring. Culture Downtown Silver Spring hosts several entertainment, musical, and ethnic festivals, the most notable of which are the Silverdocs documentary film festival held each June and hosted by Discovery Communications and the American Film Institute, as well as the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade (Saturday before Thanksgiving) for Montgomery County. The Silver Spring Jazz Festival has become the biggest event of the year drawing 20,000 people to the free festival held on the second Saturday in September.  Featuring local jazz artists and a battle of high school bands, the Silver Spring Jazz Festival has featured such jazz greats as Wynton Marsalis, Arturo Sandoval, Sérgio Mendes, Aaron Neville and such bands as the Mingus Big Band and the Fred Wesley Group.Dining in Silver Spring is also extremely varied, including American, African, Burmese, Ethiopian, Moroccan, Italian, Mexican, Salvadoran, Jamaican, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Thai, Chinese, Indian, and fusion restaurants, as well as many national and regional chains.The Fillmore is a live entertainment and music venue with a capacity of 2000 people. The venue joins the American Film Institute and Discovery Communications as cornerstones of the neighborhood’s exciting, up-and-coming arts and entertainment district. Performances by artists Prince Royce, Minus the Bear, Tyga and many other hip hop acts. In August 2012 R&B singer Reesa Renee launched her album Reelease at the Fillmore.  Silver Spring has many churches, synagogues, temples, and other religious institutions, including the World Headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Silver Spring serves as the primary urban area in Montgomery County and its revitalization has ushered in an eclectic mix of people and ideas, evident in the fact that the flagship high school (Montgomery Blair High School) has no majority group with each major racial and ethnic group claiming a significant percentage.Silver Spring hosts the American Film Institute Silver Theatre and Culture Center, on Colesville Road. The theatre showcases American and foreign films. Discovery Communications, a cable TV and satellite programming company, has its headquarters in downtown, as well. Gandhi Brigade, a youth development media project, began in Silver Spring out of the Long Branch neighborhood. Docs in Progress, a non-profit media arts center devoted to the promotion of documentary filmmaking is located at the "Documentary House" in downtown Silver Spring.  Silver Spring Stage   an all-volunteer community theater, performs in Woodmoor, approximately   north up Colesville Road from the downtown area.  Downtown Silver Spring is also home to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce that includes the National Weather Service; the American Nurses Association; and numerous real estate development, biotechnology, and media and communications companies. Transportation   The major roads in Silver Spring are mostly 3-5 lane highways. The Capital Beltway can be accessed from Georgia Avenue (MD 97), Colesville Road (US 29), and New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650).The long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC) (designated Maryland Route 200) toll road was completed in early 2012.  It has interchanges at Georgia Avenue, Layhill Road (MD 182), New Hampshire Avenue, Columbia Pike (as US 29 is known north of Lockwood Drive) and a half-interchange at Briggs Chaney Road. Silver Spring is serviced by the Brunswick Line of the MARC Train, Metrorail Red Line, Metrobus, Ride On, and the free VanGo. The bus terminal at the Silver Spring Rail Station is the busiest in the entire Washington Metro Area, and provides connections between several transit services, including those mentioned above. This transit facility serves nearly 60,000 passengers daily. Construction commenced in October 2008 on the new $91 million Paul S Sarbanes Transit Center which will further expand the station to facilitate the growing demand for public transportation, due to the increase in population in the Silver Spring area. The new center will be a multilevel, multimodal facility which will incorporate Metrobus, Ride On, Metrorail, MARC train, intercity Greyhound bus, and local taxi services under one roof. The Purple Line light rail, being studied by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is planned to service this station, if a final environmental impact statement is completed and funds are secured for it, connecting Silver Spring with Bethesda to the west and then running east to the University of Maryland-College Park and then southeast to the New Carrollton Metro station. In 2008, Gov. Martin O'Malley assigned $100 million of the state budget for planning and engineering of the Purple Line. The MTA estimates the Purple Line could carry 68,000 person-trips per day.  Construction is planned to begin in 2012. In addition to the Silver Spring station, the Washington Metrorail's Forest Glen station is also located in Silver Spring and the MARC train also stops at the nearby Kensington station.

Frederick County, Maryland  Frederick County is a county located in the northern part of the U.S. state of Maryland, bordering the southern border of Pennsylvania and the northeastern border of Virginia. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 233,385.  It is a part of the Washington Metropolitan Area, yet is also sometimes recognized as part of Western Maryland. The county is home to Catoctin Mountain Park (encompassing the presidential retreat Camp David) and to the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick. The county seat is Frederick, which was home to several celebrated historical figures like Francis Scott Key, Thomas Johnson (governor), Roger B. Taney, and Barbara Fritchie. The county (and the county seat) may have been named for Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore.  History  Frederick County was created in 1748 from parts of Prince George's County and Baltimore County.In 1776, Frederick County was divided into three parts. The westernmost portion became Washington County, named after George Washington, the southern most portion became Montgomery County, named after another Revolutionary War general, Richard Montgomery. The northern portion remained Frederick County.In 1837 a part of Frederick County was combined with a part of Baltimore County to form Carroll County which is east of current day Frederick County.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    Law, government, and politicsFrederick County is governed by county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in the state of Maryland.   Current County Commissioners Position Name Affiliation District    President Blaine Young Republican At-Large    Vice President C. Paul Smith Republican At-Large    Commissioner Billy Shreve Republican At-Large    Commissioner David Gray Republican At-Large    Commissioner Kirby Delauter Republican At-Large  The Frederick County State's Attorney, elected November 2, 2010, is Republican Charlie Smith. The sheriff of Frederick County is Republican Chuck Jenkins.

It has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964 when it voted for Lyndon B. Johnson. In 2004 George W. Bush defeated John Kerry 59-39%.  Democrats came closer in 2008, when John McCain defeated Barack Obama by a mere 1,157 votes (49.62-48.58).  Nevertheless, Republicans in Frederick rebounded to more historical levels in the 2010 Maryland Gubernatorial & Senatorial Elections, giving the Republican Ehrlich/Kane ticket 55% to Democrat O'Malley/Brown's 45. Frederick voters also supported Republican Senate challenger Eric Wargotz over incumbent Democratic Senator Barbara A Milkulski by a margin of 51-46, even as Mikulski was winning statewide by a landslide 61-37.Frederick County's fire and rescue service is handled by a combination career and volunteer service delivery system. Frederick County employs over 350 firefighters. Volunteers of the 26 volunteer fire and rescue corporations number approximately 800 active operational members.

Prince George's County, Maryland  Prince George's County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland, immediately north, east, and south of Washington, D.C. According to a 2011 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a population of 871,233,  and it is the wealthiest African American-majority county in the United States.   Prince George's County is a part of the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area, with its county seat being Upper Marlboro. EtymologyPrince George's County is named after Prince George of Denmark (1653–1708), the husband of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, and the brother of King Christian V of Denmark and Norway. Prince George's County is frequently referred to as "P.G." or "P.G. County", an abbreviation which is viewed as pejorative by some residents.  History Pre-historyThe Cretaceous Era brought dinosaurs to the area which left a number of fossils, now preserved in a   park in Laurel.   The site, which among other finds has yielded fossilized teeth from Astrodon and Priconodon species, has been called the most prolific in the eastern United States.  Post-European settlement historyPrince George's County was created by the Council of Maryland in the Province of Maryland in 1696  from portions of Charles, and Calvert Counties, and a portion was detached in 1748 to form Frederick County. Because Frederick County was subsequently divided to form the present Allegany, Garrett, Montgomery, and Washington counties, all of these counties in addition were derived from what had up to 1748 been Prince George's County.In 1791, portions of Prince George's County were ceded to form the new District of Columbia, along with portions of Montgomery County, Maryland, as well as the parts of Northern Virginia; that were later returned to Virginia.During the War of 1812, the British marched through the county by way of Bladensburg to burn the White House. On their return, they kidnapped a prominent doctor, William Beanes. Lawyer, Francis Scott Key was asked to negotiate for his release, which resulted in his writing the Star Spangled Banner.In April 1865, John Wilkes Booth made his escape through Prince George's County after shooting President Abraham Lincoln. He was on his way to Virginia.Since much of the southern part of the county was tobacco farms that were worked by slaves,  there was a high population of African Americans who unsuccessfully attempted to become part of Maryland politics in the late 19th century.  The population of African Americans declined during the first half of the 20th century, but was renewed to over 50% in the early 1990s when the county again became majority African American. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HITTING 300 Washington Post – Friday, April 19, 1996 Author: Larry Fox  The first African American County Executive was Wayne K. Curry, elected in 1994.  On July 1, 1997, the Prince George's County section of the city of Takoma Park, Maryland, which straddled the boundary between Prince George's and Montgomery counties, was transferred to Montgomery County.     This was done after city residents voted to be under the sole jurisdiction of Montgomery County, and subsequent approval by both counties and the Maryland General Assembly. This was the first change in Prince George's County's boundaries since 1791, and the first alteration of the boundaries of any county in Maryland since the early 1900s. The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    GeographyPrince George's County lies in the Atlantic coastal plain, and its landscape is characterized by gently rolling hills and valleys. Along its western border with Montgomery County, Adelphi, Calverton and West Laurel rise into the piedmont, exceeding   in elevation. According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 97.39%) is land and   (or 2.61%) is water. The Patuxent River forms the county's eastern border with Howard, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties. Regions County terrain, culture and demographics differ significantly by location within the county. There are five key regions to Prince George's County: North County, Central County, the Rural Tier, the Inner Beltway, and South County. North CountyNorthern Prince George's County includes Laurel, Beltsville, Adelphi, College Park and Greenbelt.  This area of the county is anchored by the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Laurel has a large Caucasian population and is experiencing a population boom with the upcoming ICC construction.   The key employers are the University of Maryland, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center.  Areas of geographic distinction include Greenbelt Park, a wooded reserve adjacent to the planned environmental community of Greenbelt, and University Park, a collection of historic homes adjacent to the University of Maryland.  Riversdale Mansion, along with the historic homes of Berwyn Heights, Mt. Rainier and Hyattsville are also located in this area.  The hidden Lake Artemesia, a park constructed during the completion of the Washington Metro Green Line, incorporates a stocked fishing lake and serves as the trail-head for an extensive Anacostia Tributary Trails system that runs along the Anacostia River and its tributaries. The south and central tracts of the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center also lie in this part of the county; the north tract lies north of the Patuxent River in Anne Arundel County. Central CountyCentral County, located on the eastern outskirts of the Capital Beltway, consists of Mitchellville, Woodmore, Greater Upper Marlboro, Springdale, and Bowie. According to the 2010 census, it has generally been the fastest growing region of the county.  Mitchellville is named for a wealthy African American family, the Mitchells, who owned a large portion of land in this area of the county.  Central Avenue, a major exit off the I-95 beltway, running east to west, is one of two main roads in this portion of the county. The other major roadway is Old Crain Highway, which runs north to south along the eastern portion of the county. The Newton White Mansion on the grounds is a popular site for weddings and political events.Bowie is best known as a planned Levittown.  William Levitt built traditional homes, as well as California contemporaries along U.S. Route 50, the key highway to the eastern shore and the state capital of Annapolis. Bowie has currently grown to be the largest city in Prince George's County, with more than 50,000 people. It also has a large Caucasian population, compared to much of the county (48% of the population).  Housing styles vary from the most contemporary to century old homes in Bowie's antique district (formerly known as Huntingtown), where the town of Bowie began as a haven for thoroughbred horse racing. Areas of geographic distinction include the Ogden Bowie Mansion, Allen Pond, key segments of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail, as well as planned parks, lakes and walking trails. Rural TierPrince George's rural tier may be found in the area well beyond the Beltway to the east and south of central county, bounded on the north by U.S. Route 50, the west by the communities Accokeek and Fort Washington, and the east by the Patuxent River. Prince George's origins are in this part of the county.  Most of this area contains the unincorporated parishes, villages and lost towns of Prince George's County. Largely under postal designations of "Upper Marlboro" or "Brandywine", in truth the town of Upper Marlboro is more central county in character, though it is the post office location for various rural settlements. (The names of these unincorporated areas are listed below in the towns section of this article). Since 1721 Upper Marlboro has been the county seat of government, with families that trace their lineage back to Prince George's initial land grants and earliest governing officials. Names like Clagett, Sasscer, King James and Queen Anne pepper the streets.The rural tier has been the focus of orchestrated efforts by residents and county government to preserve its rural character and environmental integrity.  Under the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), Patuxent River Park is the largest natural preserve and provides public access for birdwatching and viewing the rural tier's natural waterfront vistas. In season, the park's Jug Bay Natural Area and the Patuxent Riverkeeper in Queen Anne both offer canoeing and kayaking rentals on the Patuxent. The county's largest collection of tobacco planter mansions and preserved homes are in the rural tier, some managed by the M-NCPPC. Many rural tier roads have scenic highway preservation status; a fall drive yields exceptional beauty along the Patuxent valley's Leeland Road, Croom Road, Clagett's Landing Rd., Mill Branch Rd., Queen Anne Rd., and Brandywine Rd. Walking access along roads in this area is very limited, because most property along the roads remains in private ownership. However, walking is much more accessible in the widespread M-NCPPC lands and trails and state holdings in the Patuxent valley, such as Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and Rosaryville State Park, both popular among hikers and mountain bikers.  Inner BeltwayThe inner beltway communities of Capitol Heights, District Heights, Forestville, Suitland and Seat Pleasant border the neighboring District of Columbia's northeastern and southeastern quadrants. This region is the most densely populated area of the county, although many communities here saw a decrease in population from 2000 to 2010. A high percentage of its residents are African American.  South CountySouth county is a blend of the greenery of the rural tier and the new development of central county. The communities of Clinton, Oxon Hill, Temple Hills and Fort Washington are the largest areas of south county. It is the only portion of Prince George's County to enjoy the Potomac River waterfront, and that geographic distinction has yielded the rise of the National Harbor project: a town center and riverside shopping and living development on the Potomac. The National Harbor has become a major tourist and convention attraction, with significant hotel accommodations, eateries and shopping.  Ferry rides allow trips across the Potomac into Alexandria.  Several historic sites, including Mt. Vernon, can be viewed from the harbor front.  River Road in Fort Washington also yields great views of the Potomac.  Fort Washington Park was a major battery and gives access to the public for tours of the fort, scenic access to the river and other picnic grounds.  Oxon Hill Manor offers a working farm and plantation mansion for touring; His Lordship's Kindness is another major historic home.

GeographyGarrett County is Maryland's westernmost county, bordered to the north by the Mason-Dixon Line with Pennsylvania, to the south by the Potomac River and West Virginia, to the west by a land border with West Virginia, and to the east by a land border with Allegany County, Maryland.  The county's northwesternmost point is approximately   southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its southeasternmost point is approximately   northwest of Baltimore, Maryland.Garrett County is located entirely within the highland zone of the Appalachian Mountains known variously as the Allegheny Mountains, the Allegheny Plateau, and the Appalachian Plateau.  The county's highest elevations are located along four flat-topped ridges and range to a height of   at Hoye-Crest along Backbone Mountain, the highest point in the state of Maryland.  As is typical in the Allegheny region, broad flats generally lie below the ridge crests at elevations of approximately  .  River valleys are generally narrow and deep, with ravines typically 1,000 to   below surrounding peaks.The county contains over   of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland.  It is drained by two river systems, the Potomac and the Youghiogheny. The Savage River, a tributary of the Potomac, drains about a third of the county.  The Casselman River, a tributary of the Youghiogheny, flows north from the county’s central section into Pennsylvania. The Youghiogheny itself drains the westernmost area of the county and flows north into Pennsylvania, where it empties into the Monongahela River at McKeesport, just south of Pittsburgh.    Geologic points of interest  The Glades: Maryland's largest and most open mountain peatlandThe Glades'   is of great scientific interest because it is an ombrotrophic system (fed solely by rainwater) with peat layers up to   thick, and is one of the oldest examples of mountain peatland in the Appalachians.    On the western edge of the Savage River State Forest along Maryland Route 495 lies Bittinger, Maryland. Named after Henry Bittinger who first settled in the area, other German settlers moved in and took up the fertile farm land. On the eastern edge of Bittinger is one of the largest glades area of Garrett County. Geographically, this is an area which seems to have been affected by the last great ice sheet of North America. Two miles southeast of Bittinger, there is a large deposit of peat moss. Loess DunesIn the Casselman River valley,   south of Grantsville, Maryland and beside Maryland Route 495, one can see remains of geological evidence about the last great ice sheet over North America. A series of low mounds can be seen in the fields on the west side of Maryland Route 495 that are "loess" (wind-blown) material. Apparently, these are the only ones still visible in the northern part of Garrett County.The mounds were formed when a glacier lake existed in the Casselman valley, and the ice around the edges of the frozen lake melted. Wind blew fine grains of earth into the water around the edges where it sank to the bottom, and the mounds were the result of the deposit of this wind-blown material.

Maryland Toleration Act  The Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was a law mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian Christians. Passed on April 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies and created the first legal limitations on hate speech in the world. (The colony which became Rhode Island passed a series of laws, the first in 1636, which prohibited religious persecution including against non-Trinitarians; Rhode Island was also the first government to separate church and state.) Historians argue that it helped inspire later legal protections for freedom of religion in the United States. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics, sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of Britain and her colonies.The Act allowed freedom of worship for all trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. It was revoked in 1654 by William Claiborne, a Virginian who had been appointed as a commissioner by Oliver Cromwell and was a staunch advocate for the Anglican Church.  When the Calverts regained control of Maryland, the Act was reinstated, before being repealed permanently in 1692 following the events of the Glorious Revolution, and the Protestant Revolution in Maryland. As the first law on religious tolerance in the British North America, it influenced related laws in other colonies and portions of it were echoed in the writing of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which enshrined religious freedom in American law. Origin of the lawThe Maryland colony was founded by Cecilius Calvert in 1634. Like his father George Calvert, who had originated the efforts that led to the colony's charter, Cecilius Calvert was Catholic at a time when England was dominated by the Anglican Church.  The Calverts intended the colony as a haven for Catholics fleeing England and as a source of income for themselves and their descendants. Holmes, pp 20–22  Many of Maryland's first settlers were Catholic, including at least two Catholic priests, one of whom became the earliest chronicler of the colony's history.  But whatever Calvert's intentions, Maryland was a colony of an Anglican nation. Its charter had been granted by an Anglican king and seems to have assumed that the Church of England would be its official church. Anglican and later Puritan newcomers quickly came to outnumber the early Catholic settlers. Thus, by 1649 when the law was passed, the colonial assembly was dominated by Protestants, and the law was in effect an act of Protestant tolerance for Catholics, rather than the reverse. From Maryland's earliest days, Cecilius Calvert had enjoined its colonists to leave religious rivalries behind. Along with giving instructions on the establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants and Catholics. He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately as possible, so as not to disturb that peace.  The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland's earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment to the rights of man, but did not specifically detail protections for religious minorities of any kind.  Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert's control of Maryland.  In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable.  This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Brugger, p 20  Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649. Finkelman, p 675  DescriptionThe Maryland Toleration Act was an act of tolerance, allowing specific religious groups to practice their religion without being punished, but retaining the ability to revoke that right at any time. It also only granted tolerance to Christians who believed in the Trinity.  The law was very explicit in limiting its effects to Christians:  Settlers who blasphemed by denying either the Trinity or the divinity of Jesus Christ could be punished by execution or the seizure of their lands. That meant that Jews, Unitarians, and other dissenters from trinitarian Christianity were practicing their religions at risk to their lives.  Any person who insulted the Virgin Mary, the apostles, or the evangelists could be whipped, jailed, or fined. Otherwise, trinitarian Christians' right to worship was protected.  The law outlawed the use of "heretic" and other religious insults against them.  This attempt to limit the use of religious slurs and insults has been described as the first attempt in the world to limit the use of hate speech. The law was used in at least one attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658, a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles described in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. Underwood, pp 6–7  He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War. Brugger, p 22 The law had its detractors, even among groups those protected by it. Puritans were concerned that the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were also concerned that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, they were being required to submit to the Pope, whom they considered to be the antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony's sole established church.  Repeal and legacyIn 1654, only five years after its passage, the Act was repealed.  Two years earlier, the colony had been seized by Protestants following the execution of King Charles I of England and the outbreak of the English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion.  Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, when the Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a rebellion of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, and it would never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718.  The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenuous enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics.  It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland. While the law did not secure religious freedom, and while it included severe limitations, it was nonetheless a significant milestone. It predates the Enlightenment, which is generally considered to be when the idea of religious freedom took root, and stands as the first legal guarantee of religious tolerance in American and British history. Later laws ensuring religious tolerance and freedom, including the British Act of Toleration of 1689, the Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania, and laws concerning religion in other colonies such as South Carolina, may have been influenced by its example.   According to historian Robert Brugger, "...the measure marked a notable departure from Old World oppression."  It was not until the passage of the First Amendment to the Constitution over a century later that religious freedom was enshrined as a fundamental guarantee,  but even that document echoes the Toleration Act in its use of the phrase, "free exercise thereof". Thus, despite its lack of a full guarantee of religious freedom or broad-based tolerance, the law is, "a significant step forward in the struggle for religious liberty."

Baltimore County, Maryland    Baltimore County is a county located in the northern part of the U.S. state of Maryland. In 2010, its population was 805,029. It is part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. Its county seat is Towson. The name of the county was derived from the barony of the Proprietor of the Maryland colony, Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, in County Longford, Ireland. Baltimore County does not include the city of Baltimore, which left the county to become an independent city in 1851.Much of Baltimore County is suburban in character, straddling the border between the Piedmont plateau and, in the southern regions of the county, the Atlantic coastal plain.  Northern Baltimore County is primarily rural, with a landscape of rolling hills and deciduous forests characteristic of the Southeastern mixed forests.Among the county's major employers are the Social Security Administration, which has its national headquarters in Woodlawn, and Black & Decker in Towson.  During World War II, the Glenn L. Martin Company in Middle River had 53,000 employees manufacturing airplanes for the war effort and Bethlehem Steel had more than 30,000 workers at its sprawling Sparrows Point steel mill. Lanman, p. 115.  Of the 410,100 persons in the county's workforce as of 2009, 25% are employed in the fields of education, health, and human services, and 10% in retailing, with less than 1% in agriculture.  HistoryThe earliest known record of the county politically is January 12, 1659, when a writ was issued to its sheriff. Previously, Baltimore County was more known as a geographical entity than a political one, with its territorial limits consisting of the present day Baltimore City, Cecil, and Harford Counties, as well as parts of Carroll, Anne Arundel, Frederick, Howard, and Kent Counties.In 1674, a portion of Baltimore County, as well as a portion of Kent County, was split off to form Cecil County. In 1748, a portion of Baltimore County, as well as a portion of Prince George's County, was split off to form Frederick County. In 1773, Harford County was split off from Baltimore County. In 1837, a part of Baltimore County was combined with a part of Frederick County to form Carroll County. The separation of Baltimore County from Baltimore City occurred on July 4, 1851. Historical marker, Towson Courthouse, Baltimore County Historical Society.  Towson was voted as the county seat on February 13, 1854. The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.   The first county seat of Baltimore County was known as Old Baltimore.  It was located on the Bush River on land that in 1773 became part of Harford County.  In 1674, the General Assembly passed "An Act for erecting [sic] a Court-house and Prison in each County within this Province."    Maryland State Archives. Bacon, Thomas. 1765. Laws of Maryland at large, with proper indexes: Now first collected into one compleat body, and published from the original acts and records, remaining in the Secretary's-office of the said province: Together with notes and other matters, relative to the constitution thereof, extracted from the provincial records: To which is prefixed, the charter, with an English translation. Annapolis, MD: Jonas Green.    January 27, 2013].  The site of the court house and jail for Baltimore County was evidently Old Baltimore.  We know this because in 1683 the General Assembly passed "An Act for Advacement of Trade" to "establish towns, ports, and places of trade, within the province."  One of the towns established by the act in Baltimore County was "on Bush River, on Town Land, near the Court-House."     The court house on the Bush River referenced in the 1683 Act was in all likelihood the one created by the 1674 Act.  Old Baltimore was in existence as early as 1674, but we don't know what if anything happened on the site prior to that year.   The exact location of Old Baltimore was lost for years.  It was certain that the location was somewhere on Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), a U.S. Army facility.  APG’s Cultural Resource Management Program took up the task of finding Old Baltimore.  The firm of R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates (Goodwin) was contracted for the project.  After Goodwin first performed historical and archival work, they coordinated their work with existing landscape features to locate the site of Old Baltimore.   APG’s Explosive Ordinance Disposal personnel went in with Goodwin to defuse any unexploded ordinance.  The field team worked from fall 1997 through winter 1998.  The team dug 420 test pits, and they uncovered several artifacts including a Charles II farthing coin, French and English gun flints, as well as glass, metal and other items.  The team also uncovered a brick foundation that proved to be the remains of the tavern owned by colonist James Phillips, a prominent land holder in the area.    Along with James Phillips, the other most prominent land holder in Old Baltimore was William Osbourne.   Osbourne operated the ferry across the Bush River.  In his article Migrations of Baltimore Town, the Rev. George Armistead Leakin related a letter he received from Dr. George I. Hays.  In that letter, Dr. Hays related an event in William Osborne’s life that his grandmother, born Sarah Osborne, and his great-aunt, Fanny Osborne shared with him.  The account is of a raid by Susquehannocks who took William Osbourne’s oldest son.  Osbourne and a party were unsuccessful in their attempt to rescue the boy.  The boy was never seen by Osbourne again, and it is reported that he remained broken-hearted until his death. .,  Law and governmentBaltimore County has had a charter government since 1956. The government consists of a County Executive and a seven-member County Council. The County Executive and Councilmen are elected in years of gubernatorial elections, and the County Executive may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms.Historically, Baltimore County leans Democratic, but not as overwhelmingly as Baltimore City.  In general, the northern portions of the county lean Republican, while the southern portion is more Democratic. State's attorneyThe Baltimore County State's Attorney is responsible for prosecuting the felony, misdemeanor and juvenile cases occurring in the county.  The current State's Attorney is Scott Shellenberger, a Democrat. His predecessor was Sandra A. O'Connor, a Republican who served eight terms before retiring in 2006. Law enforcementThe Baltimore County Police Department is responsible for policing the county.  The current head of the department is Chief James W. Johnson.The Baltimore County Sherriff's Department is responsible for security of the County Circuit Courts and courtrooms as well as process and warrant service.

Sheridan, Superintendent   and Maryland Transportation Authority Police (MdTA); Marcus L. Brown, Chief   are responsible for law enforcement on Interstate highways and transportation facilities that traverse Baltimore County. Fire DepartmentThe Baltimore County Fire Department (B.Co.F.D.)   provides fire protection, emergency medical services and emergency rescue to residents of the county and surrounding areas, including Baltimore City, through mutual-aid pacts with those jurisdictions.  The department consists of both paid and volunteer companies that provide services to overlapping territories.  Currently, there are 25 career (paid) stations and 33 volunteer stations.  There are more than 1,000 paid personnel and more than 2,000 volunteers.  The department also conducts annual fire inspections on commercial properties, fire investigation and fire prevention education activities as well as water and tactical rescue in the region.  John J. Hohman   is currently Chief of the Baltimore County Fire Department. Fire Department SupportCentral Alarmers (Station 155) is a private organization that provides fireground rehab support to firefighters (personal relief stations and refreshments) during large or prolonged response incidents in the central and eastern regions of the county. County executives The current county executive, sworn in on December 6, 2010, is Kevin B. Kamenetz.

Allegany County, Maryland   Allegany County is a county located in the northwestern part of the US state of Maryland. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of 2010, the population was 75,087. Its county seat is Cumberland. The name Allegany may come from a local Lenape word, welhik hane   or oolikhanna, which means 'best flowing river of the hills' or 'beautiful stream'.  A number of counties in the Appalachian region of the US are named Allegany, Allegheny, or Alleghany. HistoryThe western part of Maryland (including the present Allegany County) was originally part of Prince George's County when Maryland was formed in 1696.  This county included six current counties, and by repeated splitting, new ones were generated: Frederick from Prince George's in 1748; Bentley, Elizabeth Petty. County Courthouse Book. Baltimore, Md.: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2009, p. 128.  and Montgomery and Washington from Frederick in 1776. Allegany County was formed in 1789 by the splitting of Washington County.  At the time it was the westernmost county in Maryland, but a split in 1872 produced Garrett County, the current westernmost county. The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.   It is the birthplace of Emmy Award-winning actress Suzanne Rogers, perhaps best known for her long-running role as Maggie Simmons Horton on NBC's Days of our Lives.

Washington County, Maryland      Washington County is a county located in the western part of the US state of Maryland, bordering southern Pennsylvania to the north, northern Virginia to the south, and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia to the south and west. As of the 2010 Census, its population is 147,430.  Washington County was the first county in the United States to be named for the Revolutionary War general (and later President) George Washington. Its county seat is Hagerstown.Washington County is one of three counties in the Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. Washington county has experienced a population boom, and is one of the fastest growing counties in the country, due to an influx of people from the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan areas. HistoryThe western portions of Maryland (including present Washington County) were incorporated into Prince George's County in 1696. This original county included six current counties. The first to be created was Frederick, separated from Prince George's County in 1748.Washington County was formed on October 1, 1776 by the division of Frederick County. At the same time, Montgomery County was also separated from Frederick County and was named for General Richard Montgomery. Washington County as created included land later to become Allegany County (created in 1789) and Garrett County (included in Allegany County when it was created in 1789, but later separated from Allegany County).

Howard County, Maryland   Howard County is a county located in the central part of the U.S. state of Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It is considered part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.  In 2010, its population was 287,085. Its county seat is Ellicott City. The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Howard County and Anne Arundel County, in the unincorporated town of Jessup. Due to the proximity of Howard County's population centers to Baltimore, the county has traditionally been considered a part of the Baltimore Metropolitan Area.   Recent development in the south of the county has led to some realignment towards the Washington, D.C. media and employment markets.  The county is also home to Columbia, a major planned community of 100,000 founded by developer James Rouse in 1967.Howard County is frequently cited for its affluence, quality of life, and excellent schools. For 2011, it was ranked the third wealthiest county by median household income in the United States by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Many of the most affluent communities in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, such as Clarksville, Dayton, Glenelg, Glenwood and West Friendship, are located along the Route 32 corridor in Howard County.  The main population center of Columbia/Ellicott City was named 2nd among Money magazine's 2010 survey of "America's Best Places to Live."    Howard County's schools frequently rank first in Maryland as measured by standardized test scores and graduation rates.  HistoryIn 1800, the mean center of U.S. population as calculated by the US Census Bureau was found in what is now Howard County. The name of the county honors Colonel John Eager Howard, an officer in the "Maryland Line" of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, commander notably at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina in 1781 among others.  He became the fifth Governor of Maryland whose home was the mansion "Belevedere".  The mansion was located at the intersection of East Chase and North Calvert Streets, north of Baltimore Town, an area also called "Howard's Woods" where the Washington Monument was later erected and the tomey neighborhood Mount Vernon, Baltimore was developed in the 1820s.    The area of western Anne Arundel County was designated the Howard District when Anne Arundel County was divided in 1839.  The Howard District had the same status as a county except that it was not separately represented in the Maryland General Assembly. In 1851, the district became erected officially as Howard County.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    GeographyHoward County is located in the Piedmont Plateau region, with rolling hills making up most of the landscape.  It is bounded on the north and northeast by the Patapsco River, on the southwest by the Patuxent River, and on the southeast by a land border with Anne Arundel County.  Both the Patapsco and Patuxent run largely through publicly accessible parkland along the county borders.  The Patuxent border includes the Triadelphia and Rocky Gorge reservoirs.According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , the smallest county in Maryland, of which   (or 99.40%) is land and   (or 0.60%) is water.

Columbia, Maryland   Columbia is a planned community that consists of ten self-contained villages, located in Howard County, Maryland, United States. It began with the idea that a city could enhance its residents' quality of life. Creator and developer James W. Rouse saw the new community in terms of human values, rather than merely economics and engineering. Opened in 1967, Columbia was intended to not only eliminate the inconveniences of then-current subdivision design, but also eliminate racial, religious, and class segregation.Columbia proper consists only of that territory governed by the Columbia Association, but larger areas are included under its name by the U.S. Postal Service and the census. These include several other communities which predate Columbia, including Simpsonville, Atholton, and in the case of the census, Clarksville. The census-designated place had a population of 99,615 in 2010,    making it the most populous community in Maryland after Baltimore.  HistoryIn 1962, Community Research and Development board member Melvin Berman took interest in a 1,032 acre parcel of land assembled by land developer Robert Moxley comprising four farm properties from the Carroll, Kahler, Wix, and his uncle James R. Moxley Sr's families.  Close to 15,000 acres were desired to create a parcel large enough for an envisioned 100,000 person development. Rouse's attorney Jack Jones set up a grid system to secretly buy land through dummy corporations to keep costs low. Moxley's firm Security Realty Company (now Security Development Group Inc),  negotiated most of the land deals for Jones, becoming his best client.   CRD accumulated   , 10 percent of Howard County (located between Baltimore and Washington), from 140 separate owners. The $19,122,622 acquisition was funded by Connecticut General Life Insurance, at an average price of $1,500 per acre ($0.37/m²). In October 1963, the acquisition was revealed to the residents of Howard County, putting to rest rumors about the mysterious purchases. These had included theories that the site was to become a medical research laboratory or a giant compost heap. At this unveiling, James Rouse described Columbia as a planned new city which would avoid the leap-frog and spot development threatening the county. The new city would be complete with jobs, schools, shopping, and medical services, and a range of housing choices. Property taxes from commercial development would cover the additional services with which housing would burden the county. The urban planning process for Columbia included not only planners, but also a convened panel of nationally recognized experts in the social sciences, known as the Work Group. Meeting for two days, twice a month, for half a year, the Work Group suggested innovations for planners in education, recreation, religion, and health care, as well as ways of improving social interactions. Columbia's open classrooms, interfaith centers, and the then-novel idea of a health maintenance organization (HMO) with a group practice of medical doctors (the Columbia Medical Plan) sprung from these meetings. The community's physical plan, with neighborhood and village centers, was also decided. Columbia's "New Town District" zoning ordinance gave developers great flexibility about what to put where, without requiring county approval for each specific project.Columbia was never incorporated; some governance, however, is provided by the Columbia Association, which manages common areas and functions as a homeowner association with regard to private property. The first manager of the Columbia Association was John Estabrook Slayton (d. 1967). For Slayton's contributions to the early planning of Columbia, the community center in the Wilde Lake village, Slayton House, was named for him. Wilde Lake was the first village area to be developed in Columbia; accordingly, the town's first high school was Wilde Lake High School, which opened in 1971 as a "model school for the nation". Constructed in the open classroom style, it was razed in 1994, but reconstructed on the same site in 1996.Two historic buildings in Columbia, Dorsey Hall and Woodlawn, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.    Both were once homes of prominent Howard County citizens. Master planTo achieve the goals set forth by the Work Group, Columbia's Master Plan called for a series of ten self-contained villages, around which day-to-day life would revolve. The centerpiece of Columbia would be The Mall in Columbia and man-made Lake Kittamaqundi. Villages and neighborhoodsThe village concept is aimed to provide Columbia a small-town feel (like Easton, Maryland, where James Rouse grew up). Each village comprises several neighborhoods. The village center may contain middle and high schools. All villages have a shopping center, recreational facilities, a community center, a system of bike/walking paths, and homes. Four of the villages have interfaith centers, common worship facilities which are owned and jointly operated by a variety of religious congregations working together.Most of Columbia's neighborhoods contain single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and apartments, though some are more exclusive than others. The original plan, following the neighborhood concept of Clarence Perry, would have had all the children of a neighborhood attend the same school, melding neighborhoods into a community and ensuring that all of Columbia's children get the same high-quality education.  Village – Neighborhoods (in rough order of opening) Wilde Lake – Bryant Woods, Faulkner Ridge, Running Brook, The Birches Harper's Choice – Longfellow, Swansfield, Hobbit's Glen Oakland Mills – Thunder Hill, Talbott Springs, Stevens Forest Long Reach – Phelps Luck, Jeffers Hill, Locust Park, Kendall Ridge Owen Brown – Dasher Green, Elkhorn, Hopewell Hickory Ridge – Clemens Crossing, Hawthorn, Clary's Forest Dorsey's Search – Dorsey Hall, Fairway Hills Kings Contrivance – Dickinson, Huntington, Macgill's Common River Hill – Pheasant Ridge, Pointers Run Town Center – Vantage Point, Banneker, Amesbury, Creighton's Run, and Warfield Triangle  Columbia takes its street names from famous works of art and literature: for example, the neighborhood of Hobbit's Glen takes its street names from the work of J. R. R. Tolkien; Running Brook, from the poetry of Robert Frost; and Clemens Crossing, from the work of Mark Twain. The book Oh, you must live in Columbia! chronicles the artistic, poetic, and historical origins of the street and place names in Columbia.  Columbia todayIn 2006, Money magazine ranked Columbia (together with Ellicott City, its neighbor to the north) #4 out of the 100 "Best Places to Live" in the United States. Money: "Best Places to Live: Columbia"  In 2008, Columbia and Ellicott City were ranked #8 on this list.  In 2010, Columbia and Ellicott City were ranked #2 on this list. In 2012, Columbia and Ellicott City were ranked #8 on this list. Education and librariesColumbia's public schools are operated by the Howard County Public School System. As of the 2007–2008 school year, the following high schools served some part of Columbia:   Atholton       Reach   Mills   Hill   Lake   all of these schools also serve students from outside Columbia, as is also the case with some middle and elementary schools.There are no conventional four-year colleges or universities in Columbia, but several other college-level programs have facilities there. Howard Community College is located near the town center, while the University of Phoenix, American Career Institute, Lincoln College of Technology, Loyola University Maryland and Johns Hopkins University have facilities on the east side of town.Howard County Library is consistently top rated among the nation’s public library systems according to Hennen's American Public Library Ratings (HAPLR).  Two of the six branches of the Howard County public library system are in Columbia, including the Central Branch in Town Center and the East Columbia Branch in Owen Brown. HealthMedical care is available in the recently renovated Howard County General Hospital, affiliated with Baltimore's famous Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Columbia Medical Plan was the city's largest health maintenance organization (HMO). In more recent years, however, this plan has divided into separate medical groups that simply share the Twin Knolls buildings. Today, there is a Kaiser Permanente facility located in the Columbia Gateway industrial park.  There are also a number of clinics, such as the Righttime Medical Care center and Patient First. ShoppingThe Mall in Columbia is a large regional shopping mall with five anchor department stores (Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Sears, Macy's, and JCPenney) and over 200 stores and restaurants. Also containing a 14-screen AMC movie theater, an L.L.Bean retail store, a Cheesecake Factory restaurant, and a Bank of America, in an outside extension area, the mall is a societal center for the community and is located in Town Center.There are several other major shopping centers in the Columbia area, including Snowden Square, Columbia Crossing I and II, Dobbin Center, and Gateway Overlook.Columbia's nine "village centers" provide residents with nearby shopping as well, often including supermarkets, gas stations, liquor stores, dry cleaners, restaurants, and hair salons. The village centers are laid out so that individual stores are not visible from the road, unlike traditional strip malls. The arrangement is criticized because it makes it difficult for newcomers and non-residents to know what shopping is available; it is praised for eliminating much of the garishness of roadside America.The village centers have evolved over time. The Oakland Mills Village Center had a traditional Village Center layout—stores located off a central corridor—until its demolition in the late 1990s. It has since been replaced with a more traditional strip mall. The Kings Contrivance Village Center underwent major construction in 2007 and 2008 when a new Harris Teeter supermarket was added to the center, but maintained the original character of stores around a central corridor and plaza. EconomyJames Rouse conceived of a city, not a suburban bedroom community, and a large area on the eastern edge was allocated for industrial purposes. The centerpiece of this aspect of the development was a General Electric appliance plant on a   site. This plant began operations in 1972 and was closed in 1990, with all but   of the property being sold back to HRD. After toxic waste remediation, one section was redeveloped for big box retail; the remainder became the large Gateway Commerce office complex, still being expanded.  There is still a smaller industrial area to the south of this, but by and large East Columbia is dominated by commercial real estate: office, retail, and wholesale. This is somewhat in contrast to the original plan, which saw the Town Center area as the commercial center of Columbia. The U.S. federal government is the source of many jobs for Columbians. Several large U.S. Department of Defense installations and R&D facilities surround Columbia, the largest being the National Security Agency at Fort George G. Meade, and the Applied Physics Laboratory, both pre-dating the establishment of Columbia. Companies which have had research facilities in the area include W.R. Grace and Company and Westvaco. Further afield, many Columbians commute to government and government contractor jobs in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area. Companies based in Columbia include W.R. Grace and Company,  "Columbia CDP, Maryland." U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on February 26, 2010.

When MaggieMoo's was an independent company, its headquarters was in the Columbia CDP.   RecreationRecreation has always been an important part of the Columbia concept. The homeowners association, the Columbia Association, known to Columbians as "CA," builds, operates and maintains most of these facilities. CA operates a variety of recreational facilities, including 23 outdoor swimming pools, six indoor pools, two water slides, ice and roller skating rinks, an equestrian center, a sports park with miniature golf, a skateboard park, batting cages, picnic pavilions, clubhouse and playground, three athletic clubs including the 24/7 Supreme Sports Club, numerous indoor and outdoor tennis, basketball, volleyball, squash and racquetball courts, and running tracks. In February, 2006, LifeTime Fitness (a Minnesota company) opened a 24/7 health club  at the edge of the Columbia Gateway industrial park. This facility includes one outdoor and two indoor pools (with water slides), racquetball courts, basketball courts, fitness equipment, and pilates and yoga facilities.There are three lakes (Lake Kittamaqundi, Lake Elkhorn, and Wilde Lake) surrounded by parkland for sailing, fishing, and boating;   of paths for jogging, strolling and biking; and 148 tot lots and play areas.Nine village centers, 15 neighborhood centers, and four senior centers provide space for a large variety of community activities. There are a variety of fairs and celebrations throughout the year, including entertainment on the lakefront of Lake Kittamaqundi during the summer and the Columbia Festival of the Arts.Columbia also has garden plots for rent, under the guidance of the Columbia Gardeners, which has been in existence since the 1970s. There are about 350 garden plots at three sites in Columbia, with each garden rented for a nominal fee (currently $30 per year). (Columbia Flyer, Doug Miller "Turning over a new leaf could be growing concern", May 31, 2007, page 17)The Rev3 Triathlon is held every October  in Columbia. It is a major national event, both half iron and full ironman distances. Entertainment/performing artsIn the absence of nightclubs, Columbia relies on local bars to bring in bands. Clyde's (near the Columbia Mall and on Lake Kittamaqundi), Sonoma's (in Owen Brown), along with Nottingham's Tavern and The Green Turtle (near Dobbin Center) regularly bring in groups to perform.Merriweather Post Pavilion, a well-known outdoor concert venue, attracts many prominent performers. In addition, there are several performing arts organizations that present professional theater, including Toby's Dinner Theatre, which has produced the area premieres of several musicals. TransportationColumbia's initial plan called for a minibus system connecting the village centers on a distinct right-of-way. This was never constructed, though minibuses were operated by the Columbia Association under the name ColumBus. These were eventually taken over by Howard County. Six Howard Transit bus routes now serve Columbia and connect it with its neighboring areas (such as Ellicott City and BWI Airport), while several Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) routes provide access to and from both Washington and Baltimore. MTA weekday commuter bus service connects Columbia to the Washington Metro system. There are no rail stations within Columbia, although the Dorsey MARC Train station is served by Howard Transit buses.Columbia has a number of roadways that serve the city: U.S. Route 29, Interstate 95, MD 32, MD 108, MD 100, and MD 175.  All of these highways allow Columbia access to nearby Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Annapolis. GeographyThe center of Columbia is located at  . However, because it is unincorporated, there is confusion over its exact limits. On the strictest definition, Columbia consists only of the land governed under covenants by the Columbia Association. This is a considerably smaller area than the census-designated place (CDP) as defined by the United States Census Bureau, which has a total area of  , of which   is land and   of it (0.80%) is water.  The CDP includes a number of older communities which do not lie within the CA's purview, including the Holiday Hills, Diamondback, and Allview subdivisions and the former town of Simpsonville, as well as some land on the east side of Clarksville. These areas are not part of the "new town", and are not directly served by its amenities. Some of these areas are included in Columbia ZIP codes by the post office, and some are not.The city lies in the Piedmont region of Maryland, with its eastern edge at the fall line. The climate is that of central Maryland, tending to hot, humid summers and cool to cold and wet winters. The primary landforms in Columbia are rolling hills and stream valleys; Columbia's road network is laid out to follow the terrain, with many winding streets and cul-de-sacs. Elevations range from about   above sea level. Most of Columbia is drained by the Middle Patuxent and Little Patuxent rivers. There are three artificial lakes, created by damming of tributary streams during city construction. Along with Symphony Woods, many other stands of mature trees have been maintained in Columbia, including the large Middle Patuxent Environmental Area in the western part of the city between Harper's Choice and River Hill villages, protecting much of the river valley from development. ClimateColumbia has a humid subtropical climate, with brisk winters and hot, muggy summers.  DemographicsNOTE: The CDP includes considerable areas which are not part of the planned community. 2010 census   Population by Race in Columbia MD (2010)   Race  Population  % of Total  Total  99,615  100  Caucasian  55,322  55  African American  25,231  25  Asian  11,390  11  Hispanic  7,884  7  Two or More Races  4,424  4  Other  2,811  2  Three or more races  465       2000 censusAs of the census  of 2000, there were 88,254 people, 34,199 households, and 23,118 families residing in the CDP.

Development plans for Downtown projects in the years ahead will include details for that project such as neighborhood design guidelines, environmental restoration, public amenities and infrastructure. These development plans must adhere to the framework of the Downtown Columbia Plan as required by the zoning legislation. Over the life of the Downtown Columbia development project, as much as 13 million square feet of retail, commercial, residential, hotel and cultural development is planned   To be accomplished in three phases, the plan calls for:The formation of the non-profit Columbia Downtown Housing Corporation to build an additional 5500 units of low income housing placed downtown in exchange for increased zoning density for other projects.  Additional development includes 4.3 milion square feet of commercial office space, 1.25 million square feet of retail space, 640 hotel rooms, Merriweather Post Pavilion redevelopment and Multi-model transportation system. The Downtown Columbia Plan also has sustainability features, including goals for saving water and energy, and for ecology and livability. Green technologies and building standards will be utilized.

The population density was 346 people per square mile (134/km²).  There were 27,576 housing units at an average density of 128 per square mile (49/km²).  The racial makeup of the county was 83.93% White, 13.11% Black or African American, 0.30% Native American, 0.88% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.49% from other races, and 1.27% from two or more races.  1.52% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 15.5% were of Irish, 15.0% German, 12.0% English, 11.5% United States or American and 7.1% Italian ancestry according to Census 2000.There were 25,447 households out of which 41.70% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.80% were married couples living together, 9.90% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.80% were non-families. 16.30% of all households were made up of individuals and 5.70% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 97.30 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.00 males.The median income for a household in the county was $65,945, and the median income for a family was $71,545 (these figures had risen to $88,989 and $100,229 respectively as of a 2007 estimate ). Males had a median income of $48,664 versus $32,265 for females. The per capita income for the county was $25,410.  About 3.10% of families and 4.40% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.10% of those under age 18 and 5.70% of those age 65 or over.According to the 2010 Census the racial and ethnic make-up of the Calvert County Population was 79.65% Non-Hispanic whites, 13.44% blacks, 0.37% Native Americans, 1.42% Asians, 0.05% Pacific Islanders, 0.12% Non-Hispanics reporting some other race, 2.40% Non-Hispanics reporting multiple races and 2.75% Hispanic. Cities and townsCalvert County includes two municipalities, both classified as towns under Maryland law:  Chesapeake Beach (incorporated 1886) North Beach (incorporated 1910)  Unincorporated areas are also considered as towns by many people and listed in many collections of towns, but they lack local government. Various organizations, such as the United States Census Bureau, the United States Postal Service, and local chambers of commerce, define the communities they wish to recognize differently, and since they are not incorporated, their boundaries have no official status outside the organizations in question. The Census Bureau recognizes the following census-designated places in the county:  Calvert Beach-Long Beach (a combination of the communities of Calvert Beach and Long Beach recognized as a unit by many people) Chesapeake Ranch Estates-Drum Point (a combination of the communities of Chesapeake Ranch Estates and Drum Point recognized as a unit by the Census Bureau) Dunkirk Huntingtown Lusby Owings Prince Frederick St. Leonard Solomons  Dunkirk, Huntingtown, Lusby, Owings, Prince Frederick, St. Leonard and Solomons have all been designated by Calvert County government as being "town centers." The "town center" designation means while these communities may not have incorporated central governments, they do have specified boundaries surrounding the central business and residential areas for zoning purposes. The reason behind the "town center" designation is to cluster new development within established areas with existing infrastructure, thus discouraging urban sprawl. The implementation of the "town center" concept in Calvert County over the past two decades has for the most part been successful in preserving rural and agricultural areas outside the designated "town centers", and stands as a key example of the smart growth planning strategy.  Other unincorporated places not listed as Census-Designated Places but known in the area include:  Barstow Broomes Island Dares Beach Dowell Lower Marlboro Port Republic Sunderland   Highways and Roads The main artery serving Calvert County is Maryland Route 4 (which begins in Washington, D.C. as Pennsylvania Avenue before crossing into Prince Georges County, Maryland and Anne Arundel County, Maryland). Route 4 in Calvert County begins at the very northern tip of the county at Lyons Creek, approximately 3 miles north of Dunkirk. At Sunderland, Route 4 meets Maryland Route 2 (traveling south as a two-lane road from Annapolis) and the two roads merge as Maryland Route 2-4. Route 2-4 continues south through Prince Frederick, St. Leonard and Lusby. At Solomons, Routes 2 and 4 split again, with Route 2 heading towards downtown Solomons and Route 4 crossing the Patuxent River at the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge into St. Mary's County.Route 2-4 is designated Solomons Island Road throughout much of the county, with the section south of Prince Frederick being recently renamed Louis Goldstein Highway in memory of Louis L. Goldstein, the former comptroller of Maryland and Calvert County resident.In the 1970s and 1980s, Route 2-4 underwent an extensive expansion project, with the formerly two-lane road becoming a four-lane dual highway. Certain portions of the highway were re-aligned, with the former roadway becoming Maryland Route 765. The final portion of the dualized Route 2-4 between St. Leonard and Solomons was completed in 1988. In 2009, a portion of Route 2-4 in Prince Frederick was expanded to 3 lines, along with sidewalks added.Other major roadways in Calvert County include:  Maryland Route 231, which travels west from Prince Frederick to the Patuxent River, ultimately crossing the river at the Benedict Bridge into Charles County.

Takoma Park, Maryland     Takoma Park is a city in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is a suburb of Washington, D.C., and part of the Washington Metropolitan Area. Founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1890, Takoma Park, informally called "Azalea City," is a Tree City USA and a nuclear-free zone. A planned commuter suburb, it is situated along the Metropolitan Branch of the historic Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, just northeast of Washington. It is governed by an elected mayor and six elected councilmembers, who form the city council, and an appointed city manager, under a council-manager style of government. The city's population was 16,715 at the 2010 national census.    HistoryTakoma Park was founded by Benjamin Franklin Gilbert in 1883.    It was one of the first planned Victorian commuter suburbs,  centered on the B&O railroad station in Takoma, D.C., and bore aspects of a spa and trolley park. Gilbert's first purchase of land was in the spring of 1884 when he bought the   Grammar farm, which was known as Robert's Choice.  This plot of land was located on both sides of the railroad station, roughly bounded by today's Sixth Street on the west, Aspen Street on the south, Willow Avenue on the east, and Takoma Avenue on the north.  At its founding, lots were sold for $327 to $653 per acre.    Gilbert purchased another plot of land in 1886.  The land was roughly bounded by Caroll Avenue to the Big Spring (now Takoma Junction) and what is now Woodland Avenue.  Gilbert named this land New Takoma.  Gilbert later purchased the Jones farm and the Naughton farm, which together he named North Takoma. Gilbert hired contractor Fred E. Dudley to build many of the home in Takoma Park. One of the homes built by Dudley was the home of Cady Lee,  which still stands today at Piney Branch Road and Eastern Avenue. Dudley's son Wentworth was the first child born in Takoma Park.   By 1888, there were 75 houses built in the community,  and the number increased to 235 homes by 1889.  The deed of each of the original houses prohibited alcohol from being made or sold on the property,     a prohibition that continued in the city until 1983.  Takoma Park incorporated as a town on April 3, 1990. Many of the streets were originally known as avenues.  When the Commissioners of the District of Columbia mandates a District-wide street-naming system, those on the District side were renamed streets but retained their names otherwise.  Other streets in Takoma D.C. were renamed entirely. Susquehanna Avenue became Whittier Street. Tahoe Street was renamed Aspen Street. Umatilla Street became Aspen Street. Vermilion Street became Cedar Street. Wabash Street was renamed Dahlia Street. Aspin became Elder Street. Magnolia Street became Eastern Avenue. In 1904, the Seventh-day Adventist Church purchased five acres of land in Takoma Park along Carroll Avenue, Laurel Avenue, and Willow Avenue.    The land was located on both sides of the Maryland-District of Columbia border.  The land was intended for a church, office building, printer, and residences for prominent members of the church.  In 1903, the Seventh-day Adventist Church decided to move their headquarters to the Washington area after its headquarters' publishing house in Battle Creek, Michigan, had burned to the ground.  The church decided that moving to a more urban setting would be a more appropriate place from which to increase the church's presence in the southern states.  The church purchased fifty acres of land along Sligo Creek in Takoma Park to build the new headquarters.  The land was away from downtown Washington and had clean water available from a natural spring located at present-day Spring Park.    For many decades Takoma Park served as the world headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church,  until it moved to northern Silver Spring in 1989. In 1964, an inside-the-Capital-Beltway extension of Interstate 70S, also known as the North Central Freeway, was proposed via a route known as "Option #11 Railroad Sligo East," up to 1/4 mile parallel to the B&O railroad upon a swath of land displacing 471 houses, that would have cut the city in two. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the future Mayor and civil rights activist Sam Abbott led a campaign to halt freeway construction and replace it with a Metrorail line to the site of the former train station, and worked with other neighborhood groups to halt plans for a wider system of freeways going into and out of DC. This controversy also raised the profile of Takoma Park at a time in the late 1960s and 1970s when it was becoming noted regionally and nationally for political activism outside the Nation's capital, with newspaper commentators describing it as "The People's Republic of Takoma Park" or "The Berkeley of the East".   Also dividing the community is the boundary line of the District of Columbia, which contains part of the original Gilbert tract. This area is now known as Takoma, D.C. While politically separate from Takoma Park, Maryland, it shares its history and much of its culture.Much of the old town Takoma Park was incorporated into the Takoma Park Historic District; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.Before 1995, the eastern boundary of the city of Takoma Park was in Prince George's County, Maryland, causing the community to be divided across two counties and the Maryland/D.C. line (where the original downtown area is located). For several years, Takoma Park lobbied the State of Maryland for legislation allowing county boundaries to be adjusted. The State finally agreed to this change, with the stipulation that cross-county municipalities would no longer be allowed; the new municipal boundary would forever remain within the county of its choosing. In August 1995, after passage of the law, the city held a public referendum asking registered voters living in three Prince George's County neighborhoods north of New Hampshire Avenue whether they wanted to be annexed to the city of Takoma Park. There was a majority of votes, 211 out of 304, in favor of annexation to the city. In November 1995, the State-sponsored referendum was held asking whether the portions of the city in Prince George's County should be annexed to Montgomery County, or vice versa. The majority of votes in the referendum were in favor of unification of the entire city in Montgomery County.  Following subsequent approval by both counties' councils and the Maryland General Assembly, the county line was moved to include the entire city into Montgomery County (including territory in Prince George's County newly annexed by the city) on July 1, 1997.    This process became known as Unification (see the Takoma Voice's 10-year retrospective on Unification).The city has experienced substantial gentrification in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), with many group houses containing accessory apartments being converted back into single-family homes. This process was encouraged by an M-NCPPC "phase back", effectively eliminating scattered-site multifamily housing and implementing single-use zoning citywide, which prompted calls by some residents  for the city to have its own planning authority. The majority of the city's population remain tenants, many of whom live in a cluster of high-rise and mid-rise apartment buildings surrounding Sligo Creek, which cuts a deep valley through the community. GeographyTakoma Park sits on the edge of the Mid-Atlantic fall line and is thus quite hilly, with many narrow, gridded streets.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.    Sligo Creek and Long Branch (both tributaries of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River) flow through the area. Sligo Creek Park and the   Sligo Creek Trail bisect the area. The main street, Carroll Avenue, and the main state highway, Route 410/East West Highway, narrow to two lanes within city limits. Takoma Park has an extensive hardwood tree canopy which is protected by local ordinance.Takoma Park is bounded by downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, a major urban center to the northwest, by Montgomery College campus; East Silver Spring, a community of houses, apartments and small shops, along Flower Avenue and Piney Branch Road, to the north; Langley Park, Maryland, a community of apartments and shopping centers, along University Boulevard to the northeast; Chillum, Maryland, in Prince George's County to the southeast, bounded by New Hampshire Avenue, a state highway; and Takoma, Washington, D.C. to the southwest, separated by Eastern Avenue, which follows the District of Columbia line.The corner of Eastern and Carroll Avenues roughly marks the center of the old commercial district. Other town centers include: "Takoma Junction", the corner of Carroll Avenue and Route 410 in the geographic center of town, home to the city's large food co-op; Takoma-Langley Crossroads in downtown Langley Park, and the Flower shopping district, both of which are home to many immigrant-owned establishments. Takoma Park's municipal center is located at the corner of Maple Avenue and Route 410. Washington Adventist University marks the corner of Carroll and Flower Avenues.

Maryland Gazette. 2008-07-16. Takoma Park has been home to a variety of local characters who have contributed to the city's sense of identity and culture, including "Catman" and Motor Cat,  Roscoe the Rooster,  The Banjo Man,  and "Fox Man",  a local animal rights activist and founder of the city's Tool Library. Takoma Park also has a year round farmer's market and two other farmers markets which sell local produce and free range meats.Underground filmmaker Nick Zedd grew up in Takoma Park and made his first movies there. InstitutionsThe Sam Abbott Citizens Center, Takoma Park's former city auditorium, has been refurbished as a community theater and gallery.  The municipal center, which includes the Takoma Park City Hall, Citizens Center and the Takoma Park Maryland Library, was expanded into a community center from 2003-2007.  A gymnasium was requested by the city's youth sports leagues after lobbying from Steve Francis, the NBA basketball player, who grew up in Takoma Park; but funding was not identified. In 2010, the Seventh-Day Adventist Church received authorization to relocate the regional Washington Adventist Hospital from the center of town to an outlying area of nearby Silver Spring, Maryland, alongside its international headquarters and the Adventist Book and Health Food Store, which had also been located within city limits. This had followed an effort by county officials to close or relocate the city's fire station, located on the side of a steep hill. Due to resulting controversy, the City Council lobbied to retain the old Hospital facility as a "health campus." The hospital had been in operation for over a century,  having been founded as the Washington Sanitarium overlooking Sligo Creek, shortly after the church's relocation from Battle Creek, Michigan.  Officials also successfully lobbied to retain a university located on the same campus, which has been renamed Washington Adventist University.In the 1970s, the city experienced controversy over plans to expand or relocate Montgomery College, which has a campus located in the historic district of North Takoma, an area of large old homes adjacent to downtown Silver Spring. This debate was subsequently resolved when the County agreed to preserve the existing campus, and expand in the direction of downtown Silver Spring by building a bridge across the B&O railroad tracks. It was renamed the "Takoma Park-Silver Spring Campus," focused on health, nursing and the arts. The expanded campus included a major new arts center located in South Silver Spring, near the boundary between the three jurisdictions.   The Washington Adventist Hospital will be moving to an alternate location within the next five years.The Takoma Park-Silver Spring Food Co-op is one of the Washington area's largest food co-ops.In the late 2000s (decade), regional and national debate occurred over the decision to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Takoma, D.C., and relocate its operations to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center.  Takoma Park Soccer Club is the sponsor of many youth soccer teams in the Takoma Park area; such as the TAPK United, coached by professional Brazilian coach Manilton Santos. They are a team who have won many games and earned the affectionate nickname Tapioca United. Law and government Takoma Park's electorate and its elected officials are known for their liberal and left-of-liberal values, which have led to the enactment of several municipal laws.  For instance, Takoma Park allows non-U.S.-citizen residents to vote in its own municipal elections. The city was also forbidden, by statute, from doing business with any entity having commercial ties with the government of Burma (Myanmar),  though after a United States Supreme Court decision struck down a similar Massachusetts provision, enforcement of the provision was suspended in the year 2000. As of 2007, the Free Burma Committee is inactive.  In 2008, the city unanimously approved a resolution to oppose foie gras.  Takoma Park is noted for being a "Nuclear Free Zone" along with cities including Berkeley, California; Cleveland Heights, Ohio; and Madison, Wisconsin. It has an active Nuclear Free Zone Committee that advocates for nuclear disarmament and is entrusted with making purchasing recommendations to the city. Employees are forbidden from purchasing from companies involved in the production of nuclear weapons or their components. Contractors working for the city must also sign a notarized document that they are not "engaged in the development, research, production, maintenance, storage, transportation and/or disposal of nuclear weapons or their components."  Waivers have been given in the past, including a waiver to purchase a library system from Userful corporation that includes computers made by Hewlett-Packard, a company that has also worked on nuclear weapons programs for the United States government.     Because Takoma Park is a certified Tree City, its residents must obtain a permit from the City arborist to cut down any tree on their property measuring more than 8 inches in diameter. This has contributed to the preservation of second-growth hardwood forest which covers much of the city, as is visible in satellite photos.Takoma Park is chartered with its own police force, public works department, housing department, and recreation department. It has also historically maintained its own Volunteer Fire Department and Municipal Library. Until 2007, the city operated a Tool Library as well, and continues to operate its own compost recycling program and silo for corn-burning stoves. As one of the most urbanized areas outside Washington, D.C., Takoma Park is densely developed with narrow houses on deep lots, often featuring mid-block developments and a mix of apartments and homes which are no longer permitted under regional suburban zoning laws, under which many apartments were de-zoned in 1989. Development and reconstruction of the fire station and other public facilities have been highly controversial , with some advocating that facilities be closed and moved to outlying, automobile-friendly areas. MayorTakoma Park is governed by a city council composed of a mayor and council members for each of six wards. The current Mayor of Takoma Park is Bruce Williams. Former mayors are:  Benjamin Franklin Gilbert (1890–1892) Enoch Maris (1892–1894) Samuel S. Shedd (1894–1902) John B. Kinnear (1902–1906) Wilmer G. Platt (1906–1912) Stephens W.

Del Giudice (1985–1990) Edward F. Sharp (1990–1997) Kathy Porter (1997–2007) Bruce Williams (since 2007)   Voting methodsIn the 2005 election, an advisory referendum on the institution of Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) for municipal elections passed with 84% approval.[17] In 2006, the City Council amended the City Charter to incorporate IRV. With this, Takoma Park joins a small but growing number of municipalities across the nation who have chosen IRV, such as San Francisco, California and Ferndale, Michigan.In the 2009 election, Takoma Park used the Scantegrity voting system. This marked the first time an open source voting system was used in a public sector election in the United States, as well as the first time a system with end-to-end verifiability was used. TransportationTakoma Park's Metrorail station sits in the heart of the old downtown area, at the terminus of Carroll Street NW, main street of the Old Takoma area (continuing as Carroll Avenue in Maryland) on the D.C. side two blocks from the Maryland line.  The Takoma Metro station is noted for having one of the highest pedestrian mode shares of any non-central business district station in the Washington Metrorail system.   New Hampshire Avenue is the only six-lane thoroughfare running through city limits, continuing into central Washington, D.C. and primarily serving through-traffic to the east of the city. Other major roads narrow to two lanes within city limits, including Route 410/East West Highway, a major state thoroughfare, and Piney Branch Road, which was narrowed from four lanes to two within city limits as a result of a traffic calming measure.  The primary route into D.C. is Georgia Avenue, the main turnpike through downtown Silver Spring, and Blair Road, a two-lane road (formerly part of the Montgomery Blair estate) which becomes North Capitol Street, a six-lane boulevard to the south. University Boulevard, the major suburban shopping strip, skirts the area to the northeast. Carroll Avenue ends two miles short of the Washington Beltway/I-95 interchange.While the   Sligo Creek Trail is primarily used for recreation by bicyclists and pedestrians, the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is sponsoring efforts to construct the Metropolitan Branch Trail, a rail trail in D.C. parallel to the Red Line, to connect Washington Union Station to Silver Spring and Bethesda, Maryland by way of the   Capital Crescent Trail for bicycle commuting purposes.

Garrett Park, Maryland   Garrett Park is a town in Montgomery County, Maryland. It was named for a former president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but whether specifically for John Garrett or Robert W. Garrett is a matter of some disagreement between sources. The population was 992 at the 2010 census. Garrett Park is home to Garrett Park Elementary School, just outside the town proper. History Garrett Park was incorporated as a town in 1898, with sponsorship by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It was named for John w. Garrett, a former President of the B&O. It was a planned community from the beginning - when the land it was built on was purchased by a businessman named Henry W. Copp in 1886, he intended to build a suburban development reminiscent of an English village. Copp even went so far as to name the streets after locations in the novels of the English author Walter Scott, such as Kenilworth and Strathmore. He also limited commercial development, and even today there is only one store in the town. Builders were given reduced rates to transport workers and materials to the town site, and new residents were given free trips to move in. Rail suburbs did not catch on in the area, however, and the community stagnated somewhat as automobiles replaced trains and streetcars as the primary means of commuting. In the 1920s, another company built approximately 50 more houses, these with garages.    Much of the town is included in the Garrett Park Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.   In May 1982 the townspeople of Garrett Park voted 245 to 46 to ban the production, transportation, storage, processing, disposal, or use of nuclear weapons within the town.  This made Garrett Park the first nuclear-weapons free zone in the United States.  Geography Garrett Park is located at 39°2' North, 77°6' West. It is just west of Kensington, due north of Bethesda, northwest of Silver Spring, and southeast of Rockville. It is approximately halfway between Rockville and Silver Spring.  Rock Creek Park is located along the town's southeast borders.Its land area is  .  According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of  , all of it land.   Garrett Park is primarily a residential town, with a post office, and a few small businesses.  The only road open to automotive traffic into or out of Garrett Park is Maryland State Highway 547 (Strathmore Avenue). The town is served by the MARC train Brunswick line. The town is unusual in that residents prefer picking up their mail at the post office in person, rather than having home delivery.

Frederick, Maryland   Frederick is a city in north-central Maryland, and is the county seat of Frederick County, the largest county by area in the state of Maryland. Frederick is an outlying community of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of a greater Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area. The city's population was 65,239 people at the 2010 census.Frederick is home to Frederick Municipal Airport (IATA: FDK), which primarily accommodates general aviation traffic, and to the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick military installation, the largest employer in the county focusing on multiple bioscience and communications programs.  History  Colonial era“Frederick Town” was laid out by Daniel Dulany — a land speculator — in 1745;  it was settled by a German immigrant party led by a young German Reformed schoolmaster from the Rhineland Palatinate named Johann Thomas Schley (d. 1790), who came to the Maryland colony with his wife, Maria Winz. Schley built the first house of the new town; as late as the 20th century, it stood at the northwest corner of Middle Alley and East Patrick Street. The settlement was founded upon a tract of land granted by Dulany on the banks of Carroll Creek. Within three years, the settlement had become the county seat of Frederick County. It is uncertain which Frederick the town was named for, but the likeliest candidates are Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (one of the proprietors of Maryland ), Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales,  and Frederick "The Great" of Prussia. Most sources favor Calvert  .The settlers founded a German Reformed Church (today the church is known as Evangelical Reformed Church, UCC), which also served as a public school, in keeping with the German Reformed tradition of sponsoring universal public education. Many Pennsylvania Dutch (ethnic Germans) settled in Frederick as they migrated westward in the late 18th century. Frederick was a stop along the German migration route that led down through the "Great Valley" (Shenandoah Valley, etc.) to the western Piedmont in North Carolina.The city served as a major crossroads from colonial times. British General Edward Braddock marched west in 1755 through Frederick on the way to the fateful ambush near Fort Duquesne (later Fort Pitt, then Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania during the French and Indian War. To control this crossroads during the American Revolution, the British garrisoned a German Hessian regiment in the town during   Afterward, with no way to return to their homeland, the men of the Hessian regiment stayed on and married into the families of the town, strengthening its German identity. When President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the building of the National Road from Baltimore to St. Louis (eventually built to Vandalia, the territorial capital of Illinois by the 1850s), the "National Pike" ran through Frederick along Patrick Street. (This later became US Route 40.) Early 19th centuryFrom these early beginnings, Frederick grew to an important market town, but by the first third of the 19th century, the town had also become one of the leading mining counties of the United States, producing gold, copper, limestone, marble, iron and other minerals. As early as the American Revolution, Catoctin Furnace near Thurmont had been a significant site for iron production.  In 1831 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) completed its Frederick Branch line from the Frederick or Monocacy Junction off the main Western Line from Baltimore westward to Harpers Ferry, Cumberland, the Ohio River, and eventually Chicago and St. Louis by the 1850s. When the first wave of Irish refugees from the potato famine settled in the city in 1846, one of the leading members of the Schley family married into the Wilson family from Ireland. Consequently, many of the Schleys converted to Catholicism, and residents of Frederick began to speak English for the first time in the town's history — up until then, the language had been German.  Frederick was known during the nineteenth century for its religious pluralism, with one of its main thoroughfares, Church Street, hosting half a dozen major churches. The main Catholic church, St. John's, was built in 1800, then rebuilt in 1837 (across the street) one block north of Church Street on East Second Street, where it still stands.  Together, these churches dominated the town, set against the backdrop of the first ridge of the Appalachians, Catoctin Mountain. The abolitionist poet John Greenleaf Whittier immortalized this view of Frederick in his poem to Barbara Fritchie: "The clustered spires of Frederick stand — greenwalled in the hills of Maryland."  Civil WarFrederick's status as a major crossroads put the town at the center of the Maryland campaigns of the Civil War, during which both Union and Confederate troops marched through the city. General Stonewall Jackson led his light infantry division through Frederick on his way to the battles of Crampton's, Fox's and Turner's Gaps on South Mountain and Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland in September 1862.  An incident with Pennsylvania Dutch resident Barbara Fritchie was commemorated in the poem of the same name by John Greenleaf Whittier. Union Major General Jesse L. Reno's IX Corps followed Jackson's men through the city a few days later on the way to the Battle of South Mountain, where Reno was killed. In July 1864, in the third Southern invasion, Confederate troops led by Lieutenant General Jubal Early fought through Frederick towards Washington DC via Monocacy or Frederick Junction.  Union troops under Major General Lew Wallace awaited the Confederate advancement at Monocacy Junction which led to the Battle of Monocacy Junction.  Slaves escaped from Frederick and the area (since Maryland was still a "slave state" although an unseceeded border state) to join the Union forces, work against the Confederacy and seek freedom. Sites of historical interest Several historic Civil War landmarks are located in and around Frederick. It was the site of a Civil War succinct speech given by President Abraham Lincoln, on his way to visit Gen. George McClellan after the Battle of Antietam and South Mountain which he gave at what was then the B. & O. Railroad depot at the current intersection of South and South Market Streets. A plaque commemorates the speech at what is today a community Social Services office).At the Prospect Hall mansion off Jefferson Street to Buckeystown Pike near what is now Butterfly Lane, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1863, a messenger from President Abraham Lincoln and General-in-Chief Henry Halleck arrived to inform General George Meade that he would be replacing General Joseph Hooker after the latter's earlier disaster at Chancellorsville in May. The Army of the Potomac, which was camped around the Prospect Hall property for the last several days in pursuit of Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia prior to Gettysburg, went on to fight several major battles. A large granite rectangular monument made from one of the boulders at the "Devil's Den" in Gettysburg to the east along the driveway commemorates the midnight change-of-command.  The National Museum of Civil War Medicine is located downtown on East Patrick Street with many exhibits on the state of medicine and surgery under the extreme war-time strains.Due west along the National Road, now Alternate U.S. Route 40, and west of Burkittsville, lie the sites of three episodes in the Battle of South Mountain: the battles of Crampton's (September 14, 1862), Fox's, and Turner's Gaps, where Confederate troops under Jackson and Walker unsuccessfully attempted to halt the Federal army's westward advance into the Cumberland Valley and towards Sharpsburg in Washington County. The War Correspondents' Memorial stone arch erected by reporter/editor George Alfred Townsend (1841-1914) can be found at Gathland State Park at Crampton's Gap, just west of Burkittsville. The 1889 memorial by Union soldiers of his IX Corps to the slain Major General Jesse L. Reno lies on the south side of the National Road, Alternate U.S. Route 40, west of Middletown, just below the summit of Fox's Gap on Reno Monument Road, along with a more recent Confederate memorial from 1993 to Brig. Gen. Sameul L. Garland, Jr., who was also killed along with a monument (2005), one-half mile south to North Carolina troops who held the line here.The Monocacy National Battlefield of 1864 lies just southeast of the city limits, along the Monocacy River at the B. & O. Railroad junction known as "Frederick Junction" or "Monocacy Junction"  where two bridges cross the stream - an iron-truss bridge for the railroad and a covered wooden bridge for the Frederick-Urbana-Georgetown Pike, which was the site of the main battle of July 1864.  Some skirmishing occurred further north across the Monocacy at the stone-arched "Jug Bridge" for the crossing of the National Road east of Frederick (built 1806) and an artillery bombardment occurred west of town along the National Road near Red Man's Hill where Prospect Hall mansion was sited as the Union troops retreated eastward.  Antietam National Battlefield and South Mountain State Battlefield Park of 1862 and Gettysburg National Battlefield of 1863 lie approximately   to the west and northeast, respectively.The reconstructed home of Barbara Fritchie on West Patrick Street, just past Carroll Creek linear park, who according to legend waved the Stars and Stripes in defiance of Confederate commander Stonewall Jackson and his troops as they marched through downtown Frederick in 1862, stands as another historical site. Though the legend has been generally discredited, it was widely believed during the Civil War and was the subject of an 1864 poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, a poem that remained popular for decades. Barbara Fritchie, a significant figure in Maryland history in her own right, is buried in Frederick's Mount Olivet Cemetery. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill quoted the famous poem to President Franklin D. Roosevelt when they stopped here in 1941 on a car trip to the presidential retreat, then called "Shangra-La" (now "Camp David") in the Catoctin Mountains near Thurmont.All the Civil War sites around Frederick are recently commemorated by illustrated placards on table-style supports of the new "Civil War Trails" system adopted by several eastern states and their tourism agencies including Maryland . These are connected with appropriate brochures and internet websites for further detailed descriptions. (  19th centuryAdmiral Winfield Scott Schley (1839-1911) was born at "Richfields", the mansion home of his father. He became an important naval commander of the American fleet on board his flagship and heavy cruiser U.S.S. Baltimore along with Admiral William T. Sampson in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba off the shores of the Spanish island colony of Cuba in the Spanish-American War in 1898. Major Henry Schley's son, Dr. Fairfax Schley, was instrumental in setting up the Frederick County Agricultural Society and the Great Frederick Fair.  Gilmer Schley served as Mayor from 1919–1922, and the Schleys remained one of the town's leading families into the late twentieth century.  Nathaniel Wilson Schley, a prominent banker, and his wife Mary Margaret Schley helped organize and raise funds for the annual Great Frederick Fair, one of the two largest agricultural fairs in the State. Since the 1960s, the fair has featured many outstanding country-western singers and become a major music festival.  Schley Avenue commemorates the family's role in the city's heritage.In 1872 the Pennsylvania Railroad completed its Frederick Secondary branch line, which ran from Frederick to York, Pennsylvania and Columbia, Pennsylvania. Jewish pioneers Henry Lazarus and Levy Cohan settled in Frederick in the 1740s as merchants. Mostly German Jewish immigrants organized a community in the mid-19th century, creating the  Frederick Hebrew Congregation in 1858. Later the congregation lapsed, but was reorganized in 1917 as a cooperative effort between the older settlers and more recently arrived Eastern European Jews under the name Beth Sholom Congregation.In 1905, Rev. E.B. Hatcher started the First Baptist Church of Frederick.After the Civil War, the Maryland legislature established racially segregated public facilities by the end of the 19th century, re-imposing white supremacy. Black institutions were typically underfunded in the state, and it was not until 1921 that Frederick established a public high school for African Americans. First located at 170 West All Saints Street, it moved to 250 Madison Street, where it eventually was adapted as South Frederick Elementary. The building presently houses the Lincoln Elementary School. Notable housesPossibly the oldest house in the city of Frederick is Schifferstadt, built in 1756 by German settler Joseph Brunner. It is now the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum.In 1814, Dr. John Tyler built what is called the Tyler Spite House at 112 W. Church Street in Frederick to prevent the city from extending Record Street south through Tyler's land to meet West Patrick Street. Williams, N.  "This Maryland House was built just for spite", Los Angeles Times, 29 April 1990  "A Matter of Spite", Frederick News Post  Geography Frederick is located in Frederick County in the north and western part of the state of Maryland. The city has served as a major crossroads since colonial times. Today it is located at the junction of Interstate 70, Interstate 270, U.S. Route 340, U.S. Route 40, U.S. Route 40 Alternate and U.S. Route 15 (which runs north-south). In relation to nearby cities, Frederick lies   west of Baltimore,   north and slightly west of Washington, D.C.,   southeast of Hagerstown, Maryland, and   southwest of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city's coordinates 39°25'35" North, 77°25'13" West (39.426294, -77.420403). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.    The city's area is predominantly land, with small areas of water being the Monocacy River, which runs to the east of the city, Carroll Creek (which runs through the city and causes periodic floods, such as that during the summer of 1972 and fall of 1976), as well as several neighborhood ponds and small city owned lakes, like Culler Lake, a man-made small body in the downtown area.  Demographics  2010 censusAs of the 2010 U.S. census , there were 65,239 people residing in Frederick city and roughly 27,000 households. The city's population grew by 23.6% in the ten years since the 2000 census, making it the fastest growing incorporated area in the state of Maryland with a population of over 50,000 for 2010. 2010 census data put the racial makeup of the city at 61% White, 18.6% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 5.8% Asian American, and 14.4% Hispanic or Latino of any race. Roughly 4% of the city’s population was of two or more races.In regard to minority group growth, the 2010 census data show the city's Hispanic population at 9,402, a 271 percent increase compared with 2,533 in 2000, making Hispanics/Latinos the fastest growing race group in the city and in Frederick county (267 percent increase). Frederick city had 3,800 Asian residents in 2010, a 128 percent increase from the city's 1,664 Asian residents in 2000. The city's black or African-American population increased 56 percent, from 7,777 in 2000 to 12,144 in 2010. For the roughly 27,000 households in the city, 30.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.7% were married couples living together, 12.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41% were non-families. Approximately 31% of all households were made up of individuals living alone and 8.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.11. 2009 American Community SurveyAs of 2009, 27.5% of the city’s population was under the age of 19, 24.5% were between 20 and 34, 28.1% were between 35 and 54, 9.0% were between 55 and 64, and 10.5% were 65 years of age or older. The median age of a Frederick city resident for 2009 was 34 years. For adults aged 18 or older, the population was 48.6% male and 51.4% female. According to U.S. census data for 2009, the median annual income for a household in Frederick city was $64,833, and the median annual income for a family was $77,642. Males had a median annual income of $49,129 versus $41,986 for females. The per capita income for the city was $31,123. Approximately 7.7% of the total population, 5.3% of families, and 5.2% of adults aged 65 and older were living below the poverty line. The unemployment rate in the city for adults over the age of 18 was 5.1%.In regard to educational attainment for individuals aged 25 or older as of 2009, 34% of the city's residents had a bachelor's or advanced professional degree, 29.6% had some college or an associate's degree, 21.6% had a high school diploma or equivalency, 6.8% had between a 9th and 12th grade level of education, and 3.6% had an 8th grade or lower level of education.The median value of a home in Frederick city as of 2009 was $303,900, with the bulk of owner-occupied homes valued at between $300,000 and $500,000. The median cost of a rental unit was $1,054 per month, with the bulk of rental units priced between $1,000 and $1,500 per month. The value of the housing stock in Frederick is above the national average and significantly higher than small nearby cities such as Hagerstown, MD and Harrisburg, PA.   This discrepancy likely reflects Frederick’s location as a desirable and growing commuter suburb of Washington, DC (and related areas in Montgomery County MD such as Bethesda), one of the most expensive housing and rental markets in the nation.  2009 census data indicated that roughly 89% of the workforce commuted to work by automobile, with an average commute time of approximately 30 minutes.   This suggests that a substantial portion of those residing in Frederick city are, in fact, commuting out of the county for work.

EconomyAccording to the City's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,  the top employers in the city are:  # Employer  of Employees   1 Fort Detrick 9,200  2 Frederick County Public Schools 5,540  3 Frederick County Government 2,355  4 Frederick Memorial Healthcare System 2,295  5 SAIC (company) 1,965  6 Wells Fargo Home Mortgage 1,500  7 Frederick Community College 899  8 Frederick City Government 852  9 United Health Care 832  10 State Farm Insurance 793  Frederick's relative proximity to Washington, DC has always been an important factor in the development of its local economy and has greatly affected its growth, particularly in recent years. More recently, its economy has been influenced by it being a center for cancer research, as evidenced by the presence of Fort Detrick, its main employer. Its economy is also strongly influenced by several other industries, including education, government, health care, mortgage and insurance, banking, science and engineering, tourism, transportation, retail, and construction. Frederick is the home of Riverside Research Park, a large biomedical research park being developed on Frederick's east side. Current tenants include relocated offices of the National Cancer Institute (Fort Detrick) as well as Charles River Labs. As a result of continued and enhanced Federal Government investment, the Frederick area will likely maintain a continued growth pattern over the next decade.    Frederick has also been impacted by recent national trends centered on the gentrification of the downtown areas of cities across the nation (particularly in the northeast and mid-Atlantic), and to re-brand them as sites for cultural consumption.Frederick's historic downtown houses more than 200 retailers, restaurants and antique shops along Market, Patrick and East streets.    Restaurants feature a diverse array of cuisines, including Italian American, Thai, Vietnamese, and Ethiopian, as well as a number of regionally recognized dining establishments, such as Volt and The Tasting Room.

A growing technology sector can be found in downtown’s historic renovated spaces, as well as in new office buildings located along Carroll Creek Park.

It was an effort to reduce the risk to downtown Frederick from the 100-year floodplain and restore economic vitality to the historic commercial district. Today, more than $150 million in private investing is underway or planned in new construction, infill development or historic renovation in the park area. The first phase of the Park improvements, totaling nearly $11 million in construction, run from Court Street to just past Carroll Street.  New elements to the Park include brick pedestrian paths, water features, planters with shade trees and plantings, pedestrian bridges and a 350-seat amphitheater for outdoor performances.A recreational and cultural resource, Carroll Creek Park also serves as an economic development catalyst, with private investment along the creek functioning as a key component to the park’s success. More than 400,000 sf of office space; 150,000 sf of commercial/retail space; nearly 300 residential units; and more than 2,000 parking spaces are planned or under construction.Completed projects include:(1) Creekside Plaza, a 90,000 sf office/commercial/residential building on the northeast corner of Court Street along Carroll Creek.

Anne Arundel County, Maryland  Anne Arundel County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. It is named for Anne Arundell (1615–49), a member of the ancient family of Arundells in Cornwall, England and the wife of Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. Its county seat is Annapolis, which is also the capital of the state. In 2010, its population was 537,656, Odenton Patch Odenton's Population Jumps 17K According to Census. by Tim Lemke, "The western portion of Anne Arundel County saw significant growth, paced by a more than 80 percent jump in residents in Odenton", February 16, 2011, accessed February 17, 2012.  a population increase of just under 10% since 2000.  Anne Arundel County forms part of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Anne Arundel County and Howard County, in the unincorporated town of Jessup.  History  The County was named for Anne Arundell, the daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, members of the ancient family of Arundells in Cornwall, England.  She married Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore in 1627 or 1628.Anne Arundel County was originally part of St. Mary's County in the Province of Maryland.  In 1650, the year after Anne Arundell's death, the county separated and became the 3rd of 23 Maryland counties.  Between 1654 and 1658, the county was known as "Providence County" by many of its early Puritan settlers.  On March 25, 1655, during the English Civil War, the Battle of the Severn was fought in Anne Arundel County between Puritan forces supporting the Commonwealth of England and forces loyal to Cæcilius Calvert.  The Commonwealth forces under William Fuller were victorious.Between 1694 and 1695, the capital of Maryland was moved from St. Mary's City in St. Mary's County to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County.  Prior to the move, Annapolis was known as "Providence". During the American Revolutionary War, citizens of Anne Arundel County supported the Continental Army by providing troops for three regiments.  The 3rd Maryland Regiment, the 4th Maryland Regiment, and the 6th Maryland Regiment recruited in the county. During the War of 1812, the USS Constitution sailed from Annapolis prior to its victorious engagement with the HMS Guerriere. On May 22, 1830, the inaugural horse-drawn train of the B & O Railroad travelled the   of the newly-completed track from Mount Clare Station in Baltimore City to Ellicott Mills in Anne Arundel County.  This was the first regular railroad passenger service in the United States.  In 1831, Land West of the railroad was considered the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. In 1851, The Howard district was broken off to form Howard County, the 21st county in Maryland. The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    Geography Physical Geography and GeologyAnne Arundel County is located to the south of the city of Baltimore. According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 70.75%) is land and   (or 29.25%) is water.  Most of the county's borders are defined by water. To the east lies Chesapeake Bay, and numerous tidal tributaries of the bay indent the shoreline, forming prominent peninsulas. The largest of these tributaries include (from north to south) the Magothy River, Severn River, South River, and West River. The Patuxent River forms the border with Prince George's County to the west. Deep Run forms part of the northwestern border with Howard County, and Lyons Creek forms part of the southern border with Calvert County. The Patapsco River to the north is the border with Baltimore County, but the Brooklyn and Curtis Bay neighborhoods lying south of the Patapsco were annexed from Anne Arundel County to Baltimore City in 1918.  Anne Arundel County originally included all of the land between the Patuxent River and the Patapsco River (mainstem and South Branch) upstream to their headwaters on Parr's Ridge. The northwestern section of this long tract later became Howard County, with the border between the two running very close to the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. As a result Anne Arundel County lies almost entirely within the Atlantic Coastal Plain while Howard County is almost entirely within the Piedmont province. Elevations in Anne Arundel County range from sea level at the Chesapeake and tidal tributaries to approximately   in western areas near the fall line.  The terrain is mostly flat or gently rolling, but more dramatic banks and bluffs can be found where waterways cut through areas of higher elevation.With the exception of the very limited extent of Piedmont underlain by Precambrian to early Paleozoic metamorphic rock, all of the county is underlain by thick deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and clay dating from the early Cretaceous to Holocene times.   Most of these sediments are unconsolidated but include local formations of sandstone, especially in the Pasadena area.

Annual precipitation averages around   per year throughout the county, with a fairly even distribution throughout the year. Annual snowfall totals around   on average at BWI Airport, which has an elevation of   above sea level. Slightly colder winter temperatures and higher snowfall are experienced at the higher elevations, with slightly lower snowfall closer to sea level.  According to the most recent USDA Hardiness zone maps, the lowland areas of the county fall into Zone 7b, with possible winter minimum temperatures of 5 to 10 °F (−15 to −12 °C), while higher areas fall into Zone 7a, with possible winter minimums of 0 to 5 °F (−18 to −15 °C).

Various organizations, such as the United States Census Bureau, the United States Postal Service, and local chambers of commerce, define the communities they wish to recognize differently, and since they are not incorporated, their boundaries have no official status outside the organizations in question. The Census Bureau recognizes the following census-designated places in the county:    Arden-on-the-Severn Arnold Brooklyn Park Cape Saint Claire Crofton Crownsville Deale Edgewater Ferndale Fort Meade Glen Burnie Green Haven Hanover Herald Harbor Hillsmere Shores Jessup (This CDP is shared between Howard and Anne Arundel counties.)

Kensington, Maryland     Kensington is a town in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,213 at the 2010 census.  Greater Kensington encompasses the entire 20895 zip code and its population is an order of magnitude larger than that of the town at its center. History  The area around the Rock Creek basin where Kensington is located was primarily agricultural until 1873, when the B&O Railroad completed the Metropolitan Branch which traversed Montgomery County.  A community arose where the new railroad line intersected the old Rockville-to-Bladensburg road.  This early settlement was first known as Knowles Station.  In the early 1890s, Washington, D.C. developer Brainard Warner began purchasing land parcels to build a planned Victorian community, complete with church, library, and a local newspaper.  Fascinated by a recent trip to London, Warner first named his town Kensington Park.  Upon incorporation in 1894, the town was renamed Kensington.  The historic core of Kensington was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as the Kensington Historic District in 1980.   Initially Kensington was a summer refuge for Washington, D.C., residents wishing to escape the capital's humid summers.  As years passed and its residents increasingly remained year round, Kensington evolved into a commuter suburb.  The large southernmost section originally mapped out by Warner remains largely unchanged since inception, and is a historically preserved zone.  Indeed the only major changes in the town's basic layout have been the bridging over of the original railroad crossing in 1937, and the extension and widening of Connecticut Avenue, the town's main thoroughfare, in 1957.The little town gained national attention three times in a 10-month span early in the 21st century as a result of events which occurred within a mere quarter-mile radius.  In December 2001, the town responded to complaints from anonymous citizens by banning Santa Claus from the annual holiday parade.  Protesters arrived at the parade en masse, including hundreds of Santas riding everything from motorcycles to fire trucks.  Eight months later, an Amtrak train derailed adjacent to the town center when the tracks separated at an overheated joint, sending over a hundred victims to area hospitals.  Fortunately, there were no fatalities.  Then, on October 2, 2002, Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera became the fifth victim of the snipers who terrorized the Washington area that month, while cleaning her auto at a Kensington gas station. (See Beltway sniper attacks.) Geography Kensington is located in Montgomery County, northwest of Silver Spring, northeast of Bethesda, southwest of Wheaton, and southeast of Rockville. Its latitude is 39°1′48″N, longitude 77°4′30″W.According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of  , all of it land.   While the town proper is but one-half square mile in size, the Kensington Post Office services a much larger area and extends into North Bethesda, MD and the Wheaton Planning District.   Residents within this ZIP code (20895) generally refer to Kensington as their home town even though they technically do not reside in Kensington.Significant through roads in Kensington include Maryland Routes 185 (Connecticut Avenue), 193 (University Boulevard West), and 547 (Knowles Avenue).The look and white color of the Washington D.C. Temple located in Kensignton, coupled with its location near the Capital Beltway has made it a local landmark.  D.C.-area traffic reports often refer to the "Mormon temple" or "temple".   Demographics 2010 censusAs of the census    of 2010, there were 2,213 people, 870 households, and 563 families residing in the town. The population density was  .

Cecil County, Maryland   Cecil County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. It was named for Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), who was the first Proprietary Governor of the colony of Maryland from 1632 until his death in 1675. The county seat is Elkton. The newspaper of record is the Cecil Whig.  As of 2010, the population was 101,108. Law and governmentCecil County is governed by county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in Maryland. HistoryThe area now known as Cecil County was an important trading center long before the county's official creation in 1674 by proclamation of Lord Baltimore. The Piscataway traded with the Susquehannocks near Conowingo, and with Lenape of the Delaware valley and their Nanticoke allies near the Elk River and Elk Neck Peninsula. A southern tribe sometimes called the Shawnace also moved into what later became Northeast, Maryland.  Captain John Smith visited the area in 1608. William Claiborne, a Puritan trader based in Virginia, established a trading post at what is now known as Garrett island at the mouth of the Susquehanna River near what became Perryville. Bohemian immigrant Augustine Herman lobbied for Cecil County's creation, and drew the 1674 maps, in exchange for which Herman received extensive land grants, including one developed as Bohemia Manor, where he eventually died. Another early developer was George Talbot, appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683,   who came from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland.  Until the American Revolution, Cecil county was an important shipping center, both within the colonies and abroad. It exported not only its own agricultural products, but also animal skins from the west and tobacco from the south. St. Francis Xavier Church (Warwick, Maryland) begun as a Jesuit mission in 1704 and rebuilt in 1792, is one of Maryland's oldest churches, though now a museum. St. Mary Anne's Episcopal Church, authorized in 1706 and rebuilt in 1742 is another (and still in use, as well as maintaining a historic graveyard). West Nottingham Academy founded by Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Finley in 1744, educated Benjamin Rush and Richard Stockton, both of whom signed the Declaration of Independence, and still operates today (though disaffiliated from the Presbyterian church and with additional buildings). The Principio Furnace, founded in 1719, became an important exporter of pig iron. During the American Revolution both British and colonial troops traveled through Cecil County, although no major battles occurred within its borders. The Battle of Cooch's Bridge occurred in nearby Delaware, and both General Howe and General George Washington stopped in Elkton during the summer of 1777. Robert Alexander, the area's delegate to the Continental Congress of 1776, spoke with both sides but ultimately decided to go into exile in England without his wife.  She remained a loyal Marylander and received a life estate in some of Elkton property that Maryland confiscated.The War of 1812 caused Cecil County considerable damage. Not only did British Admiral George Cockburn blockade the upper Chesapeake bay, in response to musket fire from colonials at Welch Point, his troops destroyed a trading post known as Frenchtown. They tried to sail further up the Elk River to the county seat at Elkton, but turned back under fire from Fort Defiance, also hindered by a cable across the navigation channel. British troops also destroyed most of Havre de Grace in nearby Harford County, Maryland. Cockburn's ships then traveled up the Sassafras River, and, meeting resistance, destroyed Georgetown, Maryland and Fredericktown, Maryland. Avoiding Port Deposit which rumors called heavily defended, the British destroyed the Principio Iron Works, an important military target.Port Deposit boomed after the Susquehanna Canal opened in 1812. Engineer James Rumsey, who grew up in Bohemia Manor before moving to Bath, Virginia (or Berkeley Springs, West Virginia), invented a steam boat which he demonstrated to George Washington, before traveling to London to secure patents against competition from John Finch. Rumsey died there in 1792, but his lawyer brother Benjamin Rumsey moved south to Joppa, Maryland and served as Maryland's Chief Justice for 25 years. Steamboats, using technology such as by Robert Fulton, came to dominate travel on the bay during the following decades. The Eagle, built in Philadelphia in 1813, transported travelers between Baltimore and Elkton, where they connected with stage coaches to travel to Wilmington, Philadelphia and other points north. An 1802 attempt to build a canal to connect the Elk River to Christiana, Delaware (connecting the Chesapeake and Delaware watersheds) failed within two years. However, between 1824 and 1829, with financial support from the states of Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania, over 2600 workers built the 14 mile long Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which became for a while the busiest canal in the new nation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still operates it today, and Chesapeake City, Maryland, which had been Bohemia Manor until 1839, has a museum explaining the canal's importance. Railroads and bridges also proved economically important to Cecil county and surrounding region. The New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad began service in 1831. Railroads crisscrossed Cecil county within three decades, although they ultimately greatly reduced its importance as a trading center. Cities such as Philadelphia and Baltimore could achieve economies of scale impossible for the county's small Chesapeake ports. Even the railroad's Frenchtown section was abandoned in 1859, and the port became a ghost town (though other sections remain in use, operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway). During the American Civil War, Perryville, Maryland became an important staging ground for Union troops. It had been the halfway point of the railroad line between Wilmington and Baltimore, but damage to the section into Baltimore caused Union troops to embark ferries at Perryville. No Civil War battles occurred in Cecil County, but residents had strongly divided loyalties. Slavery had declined from 3400 slaves in the county in 1790 to just 800 in 1850. The Underground Railroad had crossed through Cecil County, perhaps assisted by the 'Fighting Quaker,' former Congressman and U.S. Marshall John Conard, who moved to Northeast between 1834 and 1851 and was reburied at St. Mary Anne's Episcopal Church there`after his death in Philadelphia in 1857. Frederick Douglass crossed Cecil county on his road to freedom in 1838. While Jacob Tome made his fortune in the area and stayed, other Cecil county natives left in search of economic opportunity. David Davis moved to Illinois upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1835, where he became Abraham Lincoln's law partner and later served in that legislature as well as a judge, before moving to Washington D.C. to help President Lincoln, who later named him to the United States Supreme Court. Slavery's abolition affected many local property owners, as well as their slaves. After the war, Perryville again became a railroad town, and later received business from interstate highway travelers crossing the Susquehanna bridges. Although Cecil county had once been one of the wealthiest in Maryland, and has worked hard recently to attract industry as well as tourist dollars, the average income of residents is now near that of Americans as a while. Cecil County has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    GeographyCecil County is in the northeast corner of Maryland, bounded on the north and east by the Mason-Dixon Line with Pennsylvania and Delaware.  The western border is defined by the lower reaches of the Susquehanna River and the northernmost coves, flats and tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay.  On the south, the county is bounded by the Sassafras River and Kent County, Maryland.  The county is part of the Delmarva Peninsula as well as Maryland's "Eastern Shore."Topographically, Cecil County straddles the border between the rolling hills of the Piedmont Plateau north of Route 40 and the flatlands of the Atlantic Coastal Plain to the south.  The highest and most rugged hills are found in the northwestern and north-central parts of the county, reaching   just south of the Mason-Dixon Line near Nottingham, Pennsylvania and just east of U.S. Route 1. The lowest elevation is sea level along the Chesapeake Bay.Cecil County is primarily rural, with denser development around the county seat of Elkton and along Route 40.  The county is bisected from east to west by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which connects the Delaware River to the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Elk River.  The canal passes through the town of Chesapeake City, where a high-level bridge facilitates the passage of large ships beneath Maryland State Route 213.Cecil County is also bisected east-to-west by Interstate 95, known as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway in Maryland.  The highway provides a major artery for traffic between the Baltimore-Washington area to the southwest and the Philadelphia and New York/New Jersey regions to the northeast.  For purposes of the 2010 census, the federal government has designated Cecil County as part of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington metropolitan area.According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 83.31%) is land and   (or 16.69%) is water.

Harford County, Maryland  Harford County is a county in the U.S. state of Maryland. In 2010, its population was 244,826. Its county seat is Bel Air. Harford County forms part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. HistoryHarford County was formed in 1773 from the eastern part of Baltimore County. It contains Tudor Hall, birthplace of Abraham Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth. Harford County also hosted the signers of the Bush Declaration, a precursor document to the American Revolution.The county was named for Henry Harford (ca. 1759-1834), the illegitimate son of Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore. Henry Harford was born to Calvert's mistress, Hester Whelan, whose residence still stands as part of a private residence on Jarretsville Pike, in Phoenix, Maryland.  Harford served as the last Proprietary Governor of Maryland but, because of his illegitimacy, did not inherit his father's title.Havre de Grace, an incorporated city in Harford County, was once under consideration to be the capital of the United States rather than Washington, D.C.. It was favored for its strategic location at the top of the Chesapeake Bay; this location would facilitate trade while being secure in time of war.  Today, the waterways around Havre de Grace have become adversely affected by silt runoff, which is one of the primary environmental issues of Harford County.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    Environmental history Harford County has a environmental issues in three major areas:  land use, water pollution/urban runoff, and soil contamination/groundwater contamination.The county's past, present, and future population booms and land development activities have created conflicts between farmers and developers/homeowners wishing to create subdivisions. The county was one of the first in the country to implement a development envelope plan, in which new development is channeled into specific areas of the county.Because the county sits at the headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay along the Susquehanna River, it plays a key role in controlling sediment and fertilizer runoff into the bay as well as fostering submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) regrowth. The county has had to balance the needs of land owners to practice agriculture and/or pave land (creating impervious surfaces) with effects of runoff into the bay.Harford County has been burdened by soil contamination and groundwater contamination since the creation of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The military installation performs research for the U.S. Army and has released various chemical agents into soil and groundwater, including mustard gas and perchlorate. The bordering towns of Aberdeen, Edgewood and Joppatowne have been affected by this contamination.   Aberdeen Proving Ground contains three superfund priority sites as of 2006.  Groundwater contamination by MTBE, a mandatory gasoline additive, has also affected Fallston.  MDE.  "Fact Sheet - Drinking Water Well Impact: Fallston Service Center, 602 Fallston Road, Fallston, Harford County, Maryland 21047." MDE Case No. 9-0816HA. 2004-12-01. Harford County also faces controversy from residents living near Scarboro Landfill and Harford Waste Disposal Center, the only municipal landfill. The landfill, approved to triple in size in 2007, is the subject of complaints by neighbors of operating violations, such as large areas of open trash and blown litter, leachate breaks which contaminate area residential wells and flow into Deer Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, and increased health problems. Law and governmentHarford County was granted a charter form of government in 1972.  The Harford County Government includes the Harford County Public Library service and the Harford County Sheriff's Office, which now has precincts in Bel Air, Edgewood and Jarrettsville.The Harford County Executive is David R. Craig (Republican). The County Council comprises a President (elected at-large) and 6 council members (elected from single-member districts). The current President is William "Billy" Boniface. GeographyHarford County straddles the border between the rolling hills of the Piedmont Plateau and the flatlands of the Atlantic Coastal Plain along the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  The county's development is a mix of rural and suburban, with denser development in the larger towns of Aberdeen and Bel Air and along Route 40 and other major arteries leading out of Baltimore.  The highest elevations are in the north and northwest of the county, reaching 805 ft. near the Pennsylvania border in the county's northwestern corner. The lowest elevation is sea level along the Chesapeake Bay.According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 83.60%) is land and   (or 16.40%) is water.

Annapolis, Maryland        Annapolis is the capital of the U.S. state of Maryland, as well as the county seat of Anne Arundel County. It had a population of 38,394 at the 2010 census and is situated on the Chesapeake Bay at the mouth of the Severn River,   south of Baltimore and about   east of Washington, D.C.  Annapolis is part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The city was the temporary capital of the United States in 1783–1784 and the site of the Annapolis Peace Conference, held in November 2007, at the United States Naval Academy.  Annapolis is the home of St. John's College. History  Colonial and early United States (1649–1808)A settlement in the Province of Maryland named Providence was founded on the north shore of the Severn River in 1649 by Puritan exiles from Virginia led by Governor William Stone. The settlers later moved to a better-protected harbor on the south shore. The settlement on the south shore was initially named "Town at Proctor's," then "Town at the Severn," and later "Anne Arundel's Towne" (after the wife of Lord Baltimore who died soon afterwards). The city became very wealthy through the slave trade.In 1654, after the Third English Civil War, Parliamentary forces assumed control of Maryland and Stone went into exile in Virginia. Per orders from Lord Baltimore, Stone returned the following spring at the head of a Cavalier force.  On March 25, 1655, in what is known as the Battle of the Severn, Stone was defeated, taken prisoner, and replaced by Josias Fendall as Governor. Fendall governed Maryland during the latter half of the Commonwealth. In 1660, he was replaced by Phillip Calvert after the restoration of Charles II as King in England.In 1694, soon after the overthrow of the Catholic government of Thomas Lawrence, Francis Nicholson moved the capital of the royal colony to Anne Arundel's Towne and renamed the town Annapolis after Princess Anne of Denmark and Norway, soon to be the Queen of Great Britain. Annapolis was incorporated as a city in 1708. From the middle of the 18th century until the American Revolutionary War, Annapolis was noted for its wealthy and cultivated society. The Maryland Gazette, which became an important weekly journal, was founded there by Jonas Green   in 1745; in 1769 a theatre was opened; during this period also the commerce was considerable, but declined rapidly after Baltimore, with its deeper harbor, was made a port of entry in 1780. Water trades such as oyster-packing, boatbuilding and sailmaking became the city's chief industries. Currently, Annapolis is home to a large number of recreational boats that have largely replaced the seafood industry in the city.  Annapolis became the temporary capital of the United States after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Congress was in session in the state house from November 26, 1783 to June 3, 1784, and it was in Annapolis on December 23, 1783, that General Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army.For the 1783 Congress, the Governor of Maryland commissioned John Shaw, a local cabinet maker, to create an American flag.  The flag is slightly different from other designs of the time. The blue field extends over the entire height of the hoist. Shaw created two versions of the flag: one which started with a red stripe and another that started with a white one.In 1786, a convention, to which delegates from all the states of the Union were invited, was called to meet in Annapolis to consider measures for the better regulation of commerce; but delegates came from only five states (New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, and Delaware), and the convention, known afterward as the "Annapolis Convention", without proceeding to the business for which it had met, passed a resolution calling for another convention to meet at Philadelphia in the following year to amend the Articles of Confederation. The Philadelphia convention drafted and approved the Constitution of the United States, which is still in force. Civil War era (1849–late 1800s)During this period, a prisoner of war Camp Parole was set up in Annapolis. As the war continued, the camp expanded to a larger location just west of  the city. The area is still referred to as Parole. Wounded Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners were brought by sea to a major hospital in Annapolis.The first Filipino immigrated to Annapolis after the Spanish-American War when Filipinos served at the United States Naval Academy.  These Filipino immigrants dealt with institutional racism.  These immigrants later established the Filipino-American Friendly Association.  Contemporary (1900s–present) In 1900, Annapolis had a population of 8,585. To the north of the state house is a monument to Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice of the US Supreme Court and formerly a Maryland lawyer who won many important civil rights cases.Close by are the state treasury building, erected late in the 17th century for the House of Delegates; Saint Anne's Protestant Episcopal church, in later colonial days a state church, a statue of Roger B. Taney (by W.H. Rinehart), and a statue of Baron Johann de Kalb.Annapolis has many 18th century houses. The names of several of the streets—King George's, Prince George's, Hanover, and Duke of Gloucester, etc.—date from colonial days. The United States Naval Academy was founded here in 1845.  During World War II, shipyards in Annapolis built a number of PT Boats, and military vessels such as minesweepers and patrol boats were built in Annapolis during the Korean and Vietnam war. In the summer of 1984, The Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis hosted soccer games as part of the XXIII Olympiad.During September 18–19, 2003, Hurricane Isabel created the largest storm surge known in Annapolis's history, cresting at  7.58 feet (2.31 m) . Much of downtown Annapolis was flooded and many businesses and homes in outlying areas were damaged.  The previous record was   during a hurricane in 1933, and  5.5 feet (1.68 m)  during Hurricane Hazel in 1954.Currently facing the many difficult challenges of American cities today, Annapolis is undergoing rapid low-density development along its edges, ever-increasing traffic congestion, as well as ecological destruction of the very bay that it depends upon. The 1998 Comprehensive Plan will soon be replaced with a new document, containing initiatives and directives of the city government on development and infrastructure. This process was mandated by Maryland state law in the Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Act of 1992. Annapolis Charter 300 and EnVISIONing Annapolis co-sponsored a public lecture series from September 2007 through June 2008 exploring these issues.From mid-2007 through December 2008, the city celebrated the 300th Anniversary of its 1708 Royal Charter, which established democratic self-governance. The many cultural events of this celebration were organized by Annapolis Charter 300. Notable institutions  The State HouseThe Maryland State House is the oldest in continuous legislative use in the United States. Construction started in 1772, and the Maryland legislature first met there in 1779. It is topped by the largest wooden dome built without nails in the country.   The Maryland State House housed the workings of the United States government from November 26, 1783 to August 13, 1784, and the Treaty of Paris was ratified there on January 14, 1784, so Annapolis became the first peacetime capital of the US.It was in the Maryland State House that George Washington famously resigned his commission before the Continental Congress on December 23, 1783. United States Naval Academy The United States Naval Academy was founded in 1845 on the site of Fort Severn, and now occupies an area of land reclaimed from the Severn River next to the Chesapeake Bay. St. John's CollegeAnnapolis is the seat of St. John's College, a non-sectarian private college that was once supported by the state; it was opened in 1789 as the successor of King William's School, which was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1696 and was opened in 1701. Its principal building, McDowell Hall, was originally to be the governor's mansion; although £4,000 was appropriated to build it in 1742, it was not completed until after the War of Independence. Theater    Annapolis has a thriving community theater scene which includes two venues in the historic district. On East St. is Colonial Players, a company that produces approximately six shows a year on its small theater-in-the-round stage. From 1981 through 2008, Colonial Players  produced a musical version of A Christmas Carol, which they commissioned. Feeling that the production had become stale, the holiday show was replaced with another play in 2009. Public reaction was unfavorable, and A Christmas Carol returned in December 2010. During the warmer months, Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre presents three shows on its stage, which is visible from the City Dock. All shows put on by King Williams Players, the student theater group at St. John's College, are free and open to the public. Annapolis is also host to The Bay Theater Company, a non-profit professional drama group. The Naval Academy Masqueraders put on several productions annually in Mahan Hall. Museums, historical sites, and monuments  The Banneker-Douglass Museum, located in the historic Mount Moriah Church at 87 Franklin Street, documents the history of African Americans in Maryland. The museum offers free admission, educational programs, rotating exhibits, and a research facility.Preble Hall houses the U.S. Naval Academy Museum. It was named for Edward Preble.The Hammond-Harwood House is originally belonged to Matthias Hammond, and has now been restored. Tours are now offered.The Kunta Kinte- Alex Haley memorial is located in downtown Annapolis, on the harbor. It commemorates the place of arrival of Alex Haley's African ancestor, Kunta Kinte. The story of Kunta Kinte is related in Haley's book Roots.The Paca House and Garden encompasses an 18th-century Georgian mansion constructed by William Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The property includes a terraced garden that has been restored to its colonial-era design.A number of structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.    OtherThe Annapolis area was the home of a VLF-transmitter called NSS Annapolis,that was used by the United States Navy to communicate with its Atlantic submarine fleet.  Annapolis often serves as the end point for the 3,000 mile annual transcontinental Race Across America bicycle race. Middle East Peace Conference  As announced by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Annapolis was the venue for a Middle East summit, with the participation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ("Abu Mazen") and various other leaders from the region.

RailwayAnnapolis is the only capital city in America east of the Mississippi River without rail transport of any sort. From 1840 to 1968, Annapolis was connected to the outside world by the railroads. The Washington, Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad (WB&A) operated two electrified interurban lines that brought passengers into the city from both the South and the North. The southern route ran down King George Street and Main Street, leading directly to the statehouse, while the northern route entered town via Glen Burnie. In 1935, the WB&A went bankrupt due to the effects of the Great Depression and suspended service along its southern route, while the newly created Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad (B&A) retained service on the northern route. Steam trains of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also occasionally operated over the line to Annapolis, primarily for special Naval Academy movements. Passenger rail service on the B&A was eventually discontinued in 1950; freight service ceased in 1968 after the dilapidated trestle crossing the Severn River was condemned. The tracks were eventually dismantled in 1976. The popular Baltimore & Annapolis Trail now occupies the former railway line between the Severn River and Glen Burnie. The equally popular Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail occupies the WB&A's southern route into Annapolis. Government  City government Annapolis is governed via the mayor council system.

Caroline County, Maryland    Caroline County is a wholly rural county located in the U.S. state of Maryland on its Eastern Shore.  It is bordered by Queen Anne's County to the north, Talbot County to the west, Dorchester County to the south, Kent County, Delaware, to the east, and Sussex County, Delaware, to the southeast.  As of 2010, the population was 33,066.  Its county seat is Denton. The newspaper of record is The Times-Record. A second local publication, the Caroline Review, circulates monthly and is free of charge. HistoryCaroline County was created in 1773 from parts of Dorchester and Queen Anne's Counties. The county derives its name from Lady Caroline Eden, wife of Maryland's last colonial governor Robert Eden.  At the time of its creation, seven commissioners were appointed: Charles Dickinson, Benson Stainton, Thomas White, William Haskins, Richard Mason, Joshua Clark, and Nathaniel Potter.  These men bought   of land at Pig Point (now Denton) on which to build a courthouse and jail. Formation of Caroline County  Until the completion of these buildings, court was held at Melvill's Warehouse, approximately   above Pig Point.  Elections and other business transactions were completed there, and the town became the center of the county.  The first court session was held on March 15, 1774, at Melvill's Warehouse. In 1777, court was moved to Bridgetown (now Greensboro), but in the interest of convenience, court was moved back to Melvill's. Disagreements arose concerning the permanent location of the county seat.  The General Assembly reached a compromise in 1785 and ordered that   of land at Melvill's Landing should be purchased for a courthouse and jail. In 1790, the county court and its belongings moved to Pig Point.  The Caroline County Courthouse was completed in 1797. The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.     The National Park Service is considering organizing a site in the southern half of Caroline County dedicated to interpreting the Underground Railroad. Law and Government Caroline County was granted home rule in 1984 under state code in an initiative led by County Commissioner Charles T. Dean, Sr.      The current County Commissioners through 2014 are:  Jefferson L. Ghrist - Republican  Larry C. Porter - Republican Wilbur Levengood, Jr. - Republican    County Administrator: Ken Decker  Executive Assistant to the County Commissioners: Sara Visintainer    Growth is a major issue faced by Caroline County and several other Mid-Shore counties.  Retirees and workers willing to commute across the Chesapeake Bay to the western shore are increasingly attracted by the rural environment and low cost of living. The county commissioners have fought to preserve the rural nature of the county.It is the only county in the state not represented by a resident legislator in the Maryland General Assembly. Caroline last enjoyed a home delegate in the 1994 session. Redistricting and a sparse population are to blame. PoliticsThe county is divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans. There are 54 fewer Democrats than Republicans.  There are approximately 18,000 registered voters in the county. In the 2010 midterm elections, there were a total of 18,037 eligible voters in Caroline County.    7,461 were affiliated with the Republican Party,  7,407 with the Democratic Party,  59 with the Libertarian Party,  36 with the Green Party,  5 with the Constitution Party,  2,949 were unaffiliated,  and 120 were affiliated with another party.

Carroll County, Maryland   Carroll County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. In 2010, its population was 167,134. Its county seat is Westminster.Carroll County is a part of the Baltimore metropolitan area and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. While predominantly rural, the county has become increasingly suburban in recent years. HistoryCarroll County was created in 1837  from parts of Baltimore and Frederick Counties, see Hundred (division). It was named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), signer of the American Declaration of Independence. During the American Civil War, the population of Carroll County was sharply divided between supporters of the Union and the Confederacy.   In 1863, there were significant troop movements through the county as part of the Gettysburg campaign.

About half of the eastern border, with Baltimore County, is formed by the North Branch of the Patapsco River and by Liberty Reservoir, though the northern half near Manchester and Hampstead is a land border.  Carroll County is bordered on the west by Frederick County, across the Monocacy River and Sam's Creek. Other major streams in the county include Big Pipe Creek, Little Pipe Creek, and Double Pipe Creek, Bear Branch, and the headwaters of the Gunpowder Falls.

GovernmentCarroll County is governed by five county commissioners, a "commission" being the traditional form of county government in Maryland.Several times in the past, Carroll County voters have rejected charter amendments that would call for a government consisting of a County Executive and a County Council.Carroll County differs from most counties in the Baltimore-Washington area in that it is strongly Republican. CommissionersIn 2004 Carroll County voters approved legislation that will expand the number of County Commissioners from three to five. The five Commissioners will be elected from five Commissioner districts, as opposed to three Commissioners elected at-large. The change occurred with the 2010 elections, since the Maryland General Assembly did not agree on the districts in time for the 2006 elections.Commissioners elected in 2010—all Republican    —were:  Robin Frazier, Commissioner, District 1, (also served 1998-2002)      Haven Shoemaker, Commissioner, District 2      Dave Roush, Commissioner, District 3      Richard Rothschild, Commissioner, District 4      Doug Howard, Commissioner, District 5     CabinetSupporting the commissioners is a cabinet, composed of the following departments:      Administrative Services Citizen Services (Jolene G. Sullivan, Director) Comptroller (Rob Burk, Comptroller) County Attorney (Timothy C. Burke, County Attorney) Economic Development (Lawrence F. Twele, Director) Land Use, Planning, and Development (Thomas S. Devilbiss, Acting Director) Management and Budget (Ted Zaleski, Director) Public Works (Thomas J. Rio, Director)   SheriffThe current elected Sheriff is Kenneth L. Tregoning.     EducationThe Carroll County Public Schools School system is the ninth largest school district in the state of Maryland. MediaThe newspaper of record is the Carroll County Times. Infrastructure  Major Highways   State Route 26  State Route 27  State Route 32  State Route 91  State Route 97  State Route 140  State Route 194   Law EnforcementLaw enforcement services for the county are provided by the Carroll County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police, as well as several municipalities having their own police forces.  In addition to providing police services, the Sheriff's Office also acts as an agent of the courts:  serving warrants, enforcing child support laws, ensuring courthouse security, transporting prisoners, etc.  On October 4, 2007, the County Commissioners voted to create a police department for the county. The police department would handle primary law enforcement duties while the Sheriff's office would continue to act under the arm of the courts. This move would give the Commissioners power to appoint or fire the chief of police instead of having a popularly elected Sheriff being in charge of all law enforcement.  This move falls in line with Maryland's more populated counties who have such a dual system of law enforcement (Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Prince George's, Howard and Baltimore Counties), as Carroll County has begun to have a population increase.  Municipal departments, such as Westminster Police, would be unaffected by the change.   Support ServicesGeneral counseling, trauma-based therapy, support for victims of domestic violence, in-home aide for the adult disabled, and other assistance to Carroll County families and individuals are offered by Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland (FCS),   a private nonprofit organization with offices in Westminster, Maryland.   FCS also operates an adult day care center in Westminster.   Some services are offered without charge; others are offered on a sliding-fee scale based on income.==Notable people==   Francis Scott Key, author of the Star Spangled Banner, was born at his family plantation of Terra Rubra, in what is now northwestern Carroll County.

St. Mary's County, Maryland    Saint Mary's County (often abbreviated as St. Mary's County) is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland.As of 2010, the population was 105,151. Its county seat is Leonardtown. The name is in honor of Mary, the mother of Jesus. The county is part of the Southern Maryland region. HistoryThe settlement of Lord Baltimore's Maryland began with the arrival of passengers from England at St. Clement's Island in the Potomac River in what is now southwestern St. Mary's County on March 25, 1634 (the anniversary of this landing being annually celebrated as Maryland Day). The passengers arrived in two vessels, the Ark and the Dove, which had set sail from the Isle of Wight on November 22, 1633.  The county is also home to the first Catholic Mass celebrated in one of the original thirteen colonies -after they'd become English colonies (masses were said in 1526-7 at San Miguel de Gualdape). St. Mary's County was the first county established in Maryland, in 1637, probably by an order of the Governor.The county seat and state capital was St. Mary's City.In 1649, Lord Baltimore, with the Maryland General Assembly, passed the Maryland Toleration Act, which provided religious freedom for any (Christian) sect, and which was the first law of its kind in the New World.  There is a statue in St. Mary's City commemorating this event.St. Mary's County is where Francis Scott Key, the author of a poem which became The Star Spangled Banner, and professional wrestler Scott Hall grew up. St. Mary's County was the birthplace of Dashiell Hammett, and Orlando "Tubby" Smith, head basketball coach at the University of Minnesota.  The largest employer is Patuxent River Naval Air Station and its related aerospace contract firms.  There are both Amish and Mennonite communities who follow traditional ways.  Tobacco, once dominant crop, has declined in recent years.  The Maryland International Raceway (Budd's Creek) attracts many auto racing enthusiasts.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.

Somerset County, Maryland     Somerset County is the southernmost county in the U.S. state of Maryland, located on the state's Eastern Shore.  It was named for Mary, Lady Somerset , the wife of Sir John Somerset and daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour. She was the sister of Anne Calvert, Baroness Baltimore, née Anne Arundell, the wife of Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, who lent her name to Anne Arundel County. The county seat is Princess Anne.  As of 2010, the population was 26,470. It is included in the Salisbury, Maryland, Metropolitan Statistical Area. HistorySomerset County was settled and established in part due to a response to the Colony of Virginia passing a law in 1659/1660 requiring Quakers in the colony to convert to Anglicanism or leave the colony. A group of Virginia Quakers living in Accomac County, Virginia on the southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula petitioned Lord Baltimore in 1661 to migrate further north on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay to the territory under his governance, and the governor saw the opportunity to fortify the borders of his territory on the Delmarva Peninsula against the pressing encroachment of the Virginians.The Royal Charter that Lord Baltimore had received from King Charles I in 1632 had granted Maryland the land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. Later surveys authorized by Baltimore on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake indicated that the southern boundary would continue across the peninsula at the mouth of the Pocomoke River marked on the north shore by a rock outcropping labelled as "Watkins' Point". The Virginian Quakers settled just a bit north of that point, on the southern bank of the Annemessex River in November, 1662, and a separate group of Anglican Virginian settlers were granted permission to make a second settlement further north along the Manokin River.In conjunction with the two new settlements, Baltimore set up a three-man commission for the Eastern Shore territory, made up of two Marylanders and one Virginian. Its purpose was ostensibly to oversee the territory and the establishment of new settlements and maintain a detailed recording of all land and civic transactions in the area; but in fact Lord Baltimore intended to use the commission to reinforce Maryland's claim to the area and to monitor any encroachments by the Virginians.In 1663 activists from Virginia persuaded the Virginia Assembly to declare that the Virginia-Maryland border to be 30 miles north of the Pocomoke Sound, at the mouth of the Wicomico River; and ordered the securing of allegiance of all settlers south of the Wicomico River - including the Annemessex and Manokin settlements - to Virginia. In early October 1663, a militia of men from Accomac County, Virginia led by a Colonel Edmund Scarborough arrived at the Annemessex settlement and attempted to secure oaths of allegiance under threat of arrest and property confiscation. At this point, Scarborough was on a personal mission to arrest Stephen Horsey (Born on Isle of Wight, England and immigrated to Northampton, Virginia, USA 1643) the leader of the anti-tax movement and a vocal critic of the colonial government,who, along with fellow Northampton County residents William Coulborne,Randall Revell, and Ambrose Dixon signed the Tricesimo die Marty 1651. Colonel Scarborough and his force of forty mounted men arrived at Horsey's new residence on October 11, 1663, whereupon the Commands of the Assembly of Virginia against Horsey were presented. Horsey was "arrested" by Scarborough, but Horsey refused to accompany the party back to Virginia, instead declaring that he was going to remain in Maryland and maintain allegiance to the King and Lord Baltimore. Colonel Scarborough and his force of forty mounted men was summarily tossed out of the settlement. Unable to secure oaths of allegiance from the inhabitants of the Annemessex settlement they moved on.  AnnemessexArriving in Calvert's Maryland on the Lower Eastern Shore, the new settlers had to go about establishing a government for their newly formed county. Horsey was immediately recognized as a leader when he was selected to sit on the first county court which was given the job of running the new county. Charles Calvert appointed Stephen Horsey on December 11, 1665, along with Captain William Thorne, Mr. William Stevens, Mr. George Johnson, Mr. John Winder, Mr. James Jones and Mr. Henry Boston. Horsey was able to count himself among the "Who's Who" list of the founding fathers of Somerset County. To add to this prestigious leadership role, Horsey found himself ensconced with the title of "Mister". Horsey sat as a regular member of the Somerset County Court through the winter and spring of 1666. It is not known how many times Horsey traveled across the Chesapeake Bay, but it is a fact that he traveled there in 1665 along with Captain Thorne and met with Charles Calvert, who personally swore in the two new county commissioners. From the beginning, Horsey established himself as a nonconformist and as someone willing to publicly stand up for his beliefs.   The northernmost boundary of the county was also in dispute. Baltimore believed his Eastern Shore territory to extend all the way up to Cape Henlopin, at the opening of Delaware Bay - the southernmost point that the Dutch had tried to settle when they controlled the Delaware territories. But in 1673, the Duke of York had commissioned a survey line of his territory (called the Transpeninsular Line) that ran across the widest part of the peninsula through Fenwick Island, about 15 miles south of Cape Henlopin. In 1682, territorial governor William Penn declared his new territory of Delaware to extend all the way down to that survey line. But unlike the dispute of Somerset's southern border, there were few settlers in the frontier on either side to take issue. That boundary would finally be settled in 1763 when surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon incorporated the line as the definitive boundary between Delaware and Maryland.The territory continued to attract new settlers, primarily from Virginia; and by 1666, the territory had met the requirements to become established as a county in the province with its own local government. On August 22, 1666, Lord Baltimore issued a proclamation establishing the new county, including the establishment of a complete civil and military organization. The proclamation established a Sheriff and a military commander for the county, and five surveyors charged with laying out a highway to serve the county. In January 1667, the county administration laid out the five initial districts, designated as "Hundreds", into which the county would be divided. Additional hundreds were added as additional knowledge of the area was surveyed. Settlement of the county generally proceeded from the Chesapeake Bay eastward, and from Accomac County northward. The original settlers in the first two settlements were Quakers and Anglicans; and both groups continued to grow from ongoing immigration from the northern portions of Virginia colony. In the 1670s, Scottish and Irish Presbyterians began to immigrate to the county, some from Virginia, some from the British Isles. In December 1680, a prominent member of the county and professed Anglican, William Stevens of Rehoboth settlement, sent a request to the Presbytery of Laggan in northern Ireland to consider sending a Presbyterian minister to Somerset county; and the first Presbyterian minister, Reverend Francis Makemie, arrived in early 1683, quickly followed by a growing list of additional Irish Presbyterian ministers and missionaries. The towns of Rehoboth and Snow Hill along the Pocomoke River in the eastern (seaside) portion of Somerset County became Presbyterian centers in the county.  The work of these Presbyterian ministers and missionaries eventually led to the organization of the Presbytery in Philadelphia in 1706, the forerunner of the American Presbyterian Church.In 1689, partly as a result of the Protestant Revolution of 1688 in England that exiled Catholic King James II and brought in Dutch rulers William and Mary of Orange, Puritans rose up in Maryland and deposed the Catholic Maryland government. This action became known as the Protestant Revolution of 1689, and resulted in the reversion of Lord Baltimore's proprietary charter and the province being converted into a Royal colony. In 1692, the Maryland Assembly established the Church of England as the "established church" of the province, which put pressure on the Quakers and Presbyterians, whose numbers in the county began a slow decline until the American Revolution. In 1742 Worcester County was created from Somerset County. In 1867 portions of Somerset and Worcester Counties were taken to create Wicomico County.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.     Native AmericansAs the English colonies expanded, many of the Native American Tribes left Maryland and joined with larger tribes in the Ohio River Valley or, as will be seen below, joined with their neighboring tribes to the north. Some of the descendants of the tribes of Maryland remained, intermarried with the Maryland colonists, and were integrated into their society.

Talbot County, Maryland    Talbot County is a county located in the heart of the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the U.S. state of Maryland.  It is bordered by Queen Anne's County to the north, Caroline County to the east, Dorchester County to the south, and the Chesapeake Bay to the west. As of 2010, the population was 37,782. It was named for Lady Grace Talbot, the wife of Sir Robert Talbot, an Anglo-Irish statesman, and the sister of Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. Its county seat is Easton. HistoryThe founding date of Talbot County is not known. It existed by February 12, 1661, when a writ was issued to its sheriff.Founding Father John Dickinson was born in Trappe; the abolitionist Frederick Douglass was born into slavery near Tuckahoe Creek.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    Law and governmentTalbot County was granted a charter form of government in 1973. GeographyAccording to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 56.45%) is land and   (or 43.55%) is water.  Adjacent counties  Queen Anne's County (north) Caroline County (east) Dorchester County (south)   Rivers and creeksChoptank River takes its name from a tribe of Algonquian-speaking Indians who inhabited both shores of this stream before its settlement by the English. They were people of large stature. The Academy of Natural Sciences in Baltimore City holds several skeletons of these Indians (taken from an Indian earthwork mound at Sandy Hill on the Choptank) Cambridge that measure nearly   in height with skulls of unusually large size. Miles River is a corruption of Saint Michael's River, its original name. In colonial times all grants of land from the Lords Baltimore were in the shape of leases subject to small and nominal ground rents, reserved by the Proprietary, and payable annually at Michaelmas, the Feast of St. Michael and All Angels. In the calendar of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches this is observed on September 29. Because of this association, St. Michael was considered to be the patron saint of colonial Maryland, and as such was honored by the river being named for him. A large colony of Quakers were among the earliest settlers in Talbot County; as they had no reverence for saints, they persisted in dropping the word saint and calling the river Michaels River. It gradually became known as Miles. As early as 1667, six years after the laying out of Talbot County, references to these names  are found in the Proceedings of the Provincial Council of Maryland. A commission was issued by Charles Calvert, Esq., Captain General of all the forces within the Province of Maryland, to George Richard as captain of 10 troops of horse to march out of "Choptanck and St. Miles rivers in Talbot County, aforesaid upon any expedition against any Indian enemy whatsoever," etc.  At the same time, a similar commission was issued to Hopkin Davis, as Captain of foot in Choptanck and St. Miles rivers. Wye River, which forms the northern boundary of Talbot County, was named by Edward Lloyd, a Welsh immigrant who took up large tracts of land along its southern shores before the laying out of Talbot County. He named it for the River Wye, noted for its sinuosity, whose source is near that of the River Severn, near a mountain in Wales. He named his homestead Wye House, which was owned by nine generations of Lloyds.  Tred Avon River is a corruption of "Third Haven", as the Third Haven Meeting House was built at the river's headwaters in 1682.   "Third Haven" may be a corruption of "Thread Haven", an early name for the first port established at what is now Oxford, Maryland Of the thirteen Eastons in England, the most important town of that name is situated about one mile (1.6 km) from the head of the Lower Avon. The seat of Talbot County, located one mile (1.6 km) from the headwaters of Tred Avon River, changed its name from Talbot Court House to Easton in 1788 following the American Revolutionary War, as a reference to the English town. In colonial days, many merchant vessels traded between Oxford and Bristol, England, near which Easton is located. Many of the early settlers of Talbot County emigrated from this area.

Wicomico County, Maryland   Wicomico County is a county located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Maryland.  The county's name is pronounced wy-KAHM-ih-koh.  It was named for the Wicomico River, which in turn derives from Algonquian language words wicko mekee, meaning "a place where houses are built," apparently referring to an Indian town on the banks. The county seat is Salisbury.  As of 2010, the population was 98,733. It is included in the Salisbury, Maryland, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The newspaper of record is The Daily Times. HistoryWicomico County was created from Somerset and Worcester counties in 1867. GovernmentWicomico County was granted a charter form of government in 1964. The legislative functions of government are vested in the County Council. The County Council consists of seven members, five of whom are elected from individual districts; the other two are elected at-large. Councilman Matt Holloway is the current Council President.  Executive authority in the county is vested in the office of County Executive. Rick Pollitt (D), former Fruitland City Manager, is the first to hold the title County Executive. The county executive is elected in a countywide vote. Law enforcement in the county is provided by the Wicomico County sheriff's office.  The sheriff, Mike Lewis (R), is an elected official.  Municipal police agencies exist in the town of Delmar and the cities of Fruitland and Salisbury.  GeographyAccording to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 94.34%) is land and   (or 5.66%) is water. The county's boundary with Delaware is composed of the Mason-Dixon line and the Transpeninsular Line. The intersection of these two historical lines is the midpoint of the Transpeninsular Line, fixed by Mason and Dixon between 1763 and 1767. The midpoint is located about   northwest of Salisbury, near the center of the Delmarva Peninsula.  The county is generally flat, characteristic of the region, with a few small hills in the northeast. The lowest elevation is at sea level and the highest elevation is  .

Worcester County, Maryland   Worcester County ( ) is the easternmost county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. The county includes the entire length of the state's Atlantic coast.  It is home to the popular vacation resort area of Ocean City, as well as wild habitats on Assateague Island and in the Pocomoke Swamp.  The county was named for an Earl of Worcester. Its county seat is Snow Hill.  It is included in the Ocean Pines, Maryland, Micropolitan Statistical Area.  The population was 51,454 at the 2010 census.  HistoryWorcester County was created by the division of Somerset County in 1742.  The county seat, previously located near the confluence of Dividing Creek with the Pocomoke River, was transferred to the river port of Snow Hill, at the head of navigation of the Pocomoke, near the center of the new county.Both Somerset and Worcester Counties were early on divided into hundreds, from south to north: Mattapony, Pocomoke, Boquetenorton, Wicomico, and Baltimore Hundreds.  Later subdivisions of the hundreds added Pitts Creek, Acquango, Queponco, and Buckingham & Worcester Hundreds, all of which in turn became election districts following American independence. Competing territorial claims between the Calverts of Maryland and the Penns of Pennsylvania and of what later became the state of Delaware led to the surveying of Worcester County's northern border, the Transpeninsular Line in 1751, though boundary disputes continued through the rest of the colonial period. In 1779, Stephen Decatur, hero of the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War, was born at Sinepuxent, near what is today the town of Berlin.  Originally settled almost entirely by immigrants of British and Irish stock, Worcester County was divided during the colonial period into several parishes, though Quakers, Presbyterians, and later Methodists also set up meeting houses. Like the border states in general, Worcester County had a high proportion of free people of color for many decades before the Civil War, due in part to the influence of initially Quakerism, and later Methodism.  Worcester County was primarily an agricultural area from its inception, first planting tobacco, but when the quality produced in the area's sandy soil could not compete with that produced elsewhere, growing wheat, corn, and livestock. Early industrial activity included the smelting of bog iron ore in a brick blast furnace to make pig iron at Furnacetown in the first half of the 19th century. The presence of large bald cypress swamps along the Pocomoke River led to logging, the manufacture of roofing shingles, and shipbuilding along the river at Newtown (later Pocomoke City). The arrival of steam-powered water transport and then the railroad opened urban markets to another of Worcester County's principal products: seafood, particularly shellfish. Oysters, clams, and crabs were shipped to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Soon after the Civil War (to each side of which Worcester County sent soldiers), parts of both Worcester and Somerset Counties were combined to create, in 1867, Wicomico County. Also in the later 19th century, the seaside resort of Ocean City was founded.Truck farming and the canning industry came to the fore during the early 20th century. However, both the seafood industry and truck farming declined after mid-century, due to overfishing on the one hand, and the opening of California's Central Valley to irrigated agriculture on the other, but the advent of the large-scale poultry industry filled this gap. The expansion of Ocean City since the 1960s has turned the northern part of the county from a summer resort to an expanding year-round community.Two major storms influenced the course of Worcester County history in the 20th century: the hurricane of 1933, which badly damaged Ocean City and Public Landing, but also cut the Ocean City Inlet, and the nor'easter of 1962, which destroyed much of the residential development on Assateague Island and led to the creation of the National Seashore.The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.    Law and governmentWorcester County was granted home rule in 1976 under a state code. There is a circuit court located in Snow Hill and two district courts. EducationThe following institutions are part of the Worcester County public school system, governed by the Worcester County Board of Education:  Showell Elementary School Buckingham Elementary School Ocean City Elementary School Snow Hill Elementary School Pocomoke Elementary School Berlin Intermediate School Stephen Decatur Middle School Snow Hill Middle School Pocomoke Middle School Stephen Decatur High School Snow Hill High School Pocomoke High School Worcester Technical High School Cedar Chapel Special School  In the fall of 2008 Worcester County has plans to open Worcester Technical High School to all residents of the county, to replace Worcester Career and Technology Center.The following private schools also operate in Worcester County:  Worcester Preparatory School Seaside Christian Academy Most Blessed Sacrament Catholic School Snow Hill Mennonite School The Tidewater School by the Sea   GeographyAccording to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of  , of which   (or 68.12%) is land and   (or 31.88%) is water. The terrain is mostly level and coastal. The lowest elevation is sea level along the Atlantic Ocean and the highest elevation is   in the northwestern part of the county along State Route 12 just south of the Wicomico County line. National protected area  Assateague Island National Seashore (part) Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge (part)   TransportationMajor U.S. highways in Worcester County include U.S. Route 50, whose east end is in Ocean City. US 50 serves as one of the main access points to Ocean City, also surrounded by a vast amount of commercial development. U.S. Route 13 is the main north–south route of the Delmarva Peninsula, providing access to Pocomoke City. U.S. Route 113 is the main north–south artery of Worcester County, and is well-known locally for its dangerous two-lane sections which are currently being addressed. US 113 also possesses a business route through Snow Hill. Major state highways include Maryland Route 90, which is a freeway from US 50 to northern Ocean City, and Maryland Route 12, which connects Snow Hill and Salisbury.Freight trains run into Delaware from Snow Hill on the Worcester Railroad, and the main line (formerly Pennsylvania Railroad) from Philadelphia to Cape Charles, Virginia and Norfolk runs through the southeastern corner of the county.

List of counties in Maryland  There are twenty-four counties and county-equivalents in the U.S. state of Maryland. Though an independent city rather than a county, the City of Baltimore is considered the equal of a county for most purposes and is a county-equivalent. Many of the counties in Maryland were named for relatives of the Barons Baltimore who were the proprietors of the Maryland colony from its founding in 1634 through 1771. The Barons Baltimore were Catholic, and George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, originally intended that the colony be a haven for English Catholics, though for most of its history Maryland has had a majority of Protestants. The last new county formation in Maryland occurred when Garrett County was formed in 1872 from portions of Allegany County.    However, there have been numerous border changes since that time, most recently when portions of the city of Takoma Park that had previously been part of Prince George's County were absorbed into Montgomery County in 1997. Outside of Baltimore (which is an independent city) the county is the default unit of local government. Under Maryland law, counties exercise powers reserved in most other states at the municipal or state levels, so there is little incentive for a community to incorporate. Many of the state's most populous and economically important communities, such as Bethesda, Silver Spring, Columbia, and Towson are unincorporated and receive their municipal services from the county. In fact, there are no incorporated municipalities at all in Baltimore County or Howard County. The county-equivalent is also the provider of public schools - school districts as a separate level of government do not exist in Maryland.The City of Baltimore generally possesses the same powers and responsibilities as the counties within the state. It is an entity nearly surrounded by but separate from the County of Baltimore, which has its county seat in Towson.The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.  Maryland's code is 24, which when combined with any county code would be written as 24XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

Wheaton, Maryland   Wheaton is an unincorporated, urbanized area in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA, north of Washington, D.C., northwest of Silver Spring. Wheaton takes its name from Frank Wheaton (1833–1903), a career officer in the United States Army and volunteer from Rhode Island in the Union Army who rose to the rank of major-general while serving before, during, and after the American Civil War.Wheaton's boundaries are not officially defined. The United States Census Bureau has not chosen to make Wheaton itself into a Census-Designated Place, but instead combines it with Glenmont into a single Wheaton-Glenmont CDP, centered at  , whose 2000 census population was 57,694. According to Rand McNally, the Greater Wheaton area (which extends beyond Wheaton-Glenmont CDP) had an estimated population of 134,800 in 2005. The United States Geological Survey, however, does consider Wheaton as a place whose center is at latitude  . The United States Postal Service has assigned Zip Code 20902 to Wheaton but the Wheaton Post Office is part of the Silver Spring area. Downtown Wheaton can be found at the intersections of Veirs Mill Road (Md. Rt. 586), University Boulevard (Md. Rt. 193), and Georgia Avenue (Md. Rt. 97). History The Three Great RoadsWheaton developed from Leesborough (named in 1826), a business district which popped near the junction of three major roads: The first is Brookeville Pike (also known as the "Washington-Brookeville Pike" and later as the "Union Turnpike", now MD Route 97, Georgia Ave) a north/south toll thoroughfare running from Washington, DC to Brookeville, Maryland and eventually to Baltimore, Maryland.The second road, Veirs Mill Road (MD Route 586, named after a grist and sawmill built on Rock Creek by Samuel Clark Veirs in 1838 Historical Marker Database ), was one portion of a much longer thoroughfare connecting westwards to Rockville, Maryland and thence towards the Potomac River and subsequently to Virginia via ferry crossings.  This was also known as the "City Road" in Rockville, and around the time of the American Civil War it was known also as the "New Cut Road." Civil War Defenses of Washington Chapter VII  The History Of Montgomery County, Maryland, From Its Earliest Settlement In 1650 to 1879 (Boyd, T. H. S.) The last of these roads was known as Old Bladensburg Road (now MD Route 193, University Boulevard) which, as it does in present day, connected Georgetown, Bethesda, Chevy Chase, and Bladensburg. A History of Wheaton (Discover Wheaton), Montgomery County Government  Mitchell's CrossroadsThe business district subsequently became known as Mitchell's Crossroads in the 1860s referring to Mitchell's Tavern which was located at northeast corner of Union Turnpike (renamed from Brookeville Pike) and Old Bladensburg Road.  Mitchell's Tavern was thought to be over 100 years old in 1865 and stood until 1940 when it was destroyed by a fire. In October 1869, the post office was renamed in honor of General Frank Wheaton by the area's first Postmaster George F. Plyer who served as a Private under Gen. Wheaton in 1861 during the American Civil War.  Gen. Wheaton had become a local folk hero when he successfully defended Washington, DC and nearby Fort Stevens from an attack by Confederate General Jubal Early on July 11–12, 1864.  Demographic shiftsIn the 1950s the area was developed with Cape Cod, ranch houses, and split level homes owned by white affluent families.  Now more of the aging housing stock is rented by a diverse population. This table shows the subsequent shift in demographics:   Wheaton MD Census data Year White Hispanic Asian Black Multiracial  1990 61% 13% 10% 15%       2000 38% 29% 12% 17% 6%  2010 26% 42% 12% 18% 5%             Between 2000 and 2010, Wheaton's Hispanic population has increased from 29% to 42%. In the past couple of years, since the collapse of the real estate market, high number of properties owned by Hispanics have been repossessed by lenders. Most of these homes were sold and then renovated by investors to be resold to professional White start up families. FeaturesWheaton is home to the Wheaton Regional Park, which includes a nature center; riding stables; dog park; a picnic area with carousel and miniature train; an athletic complex with tennis bubble, ice rink, in-line skating rink, and ball fields; and Brookside Gardens, Montgomery County's award-winning 50-acre (200,000-m²) public display garden. Much of Wheaton was developed in the 1950s. In the 1960s its shopping center, Wheaton Plaza (now known as Westfield Wheaton), was the largest in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. Wheaton is also home to the Wheaton Regional Public Library.  The Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad is located in the Central Business District and is one of the busiest (11,000 calls in 2007) predominantly volunteer fire departments in Montgomery County. The diversity of the neighborhood is reflected by the high concentration of various ethnic restaurants located in Wheaton, as well as in the composition of the student body of Wheaton High School (school website), part of the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS website) and located near the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Randolph Road.It is served by the Red Line of the Washington Metro system.  Spanning 508 feet (155m), the Wheaton Metro station has the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere.    Since Wheaton has the highest location in the Washington, DC area, it was also the home of the first television license in the United States.  Using the call sign W3XK, Charles Francis Jenkins began broadcasting from his home at the corner of Windham Lane and Georgia Ave.   starting on July 2, 1928.  Designation as a Maryland Arts and Entertainment DistrictWheaton has been designated by the State of Maryland as an Arts and Entertainment District, joining Silver Spring and Bethesda as the third district in Montgomery County to receive the distinction. The Arts and Entertainment District designation provides artists working in that area with an income tax break. Developers who create spaces for artists to live and work can be exempt from paying certain property taxes on the value of the renovations for up to 10 years. Designated districts are exempt from admissions and amusement taxes.

Aspen Hill, Maryland   Aspen Hill is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland. It got its name from aspen trees that once were found near the first post office in the area. The post office was located in a general store on what was then known as the Washington-Brookeville Pike (now the intersection of Connecticut and Georgia Avenues) and opened around 1864.Aspen Hill was one of the locations in which a fatal shooting took place in October 2002 as part of the Beltway sniper attacks. GeographyAs an unincorporated area, Aspen Hill's boundaries are not officially defined. The United States Postal Service does not even use the name Aspen Hill (except as a station name in the Silver Spring Post Office), preferring to divide it between Rockville, Silver Spring, and Wheaton. Some addresses are referenced as Wheaton (20906),  notably in the Aspen Hill Shopping Center, while immediately across Aspen Hill Road at the Northgate Plaza Shopping Center, the addresses are in Silver Spring (20906).  Immediately to the west across Connecticut Avenue, addresses are given as being in Rockville (20853).  As a result, statistics such as crime statistics which are reasonably considered as belonging to Aspen Hill are buried in the statistics of three different areas. Aspen Hill straddles a corner where three statistical areas meet in what locals consider the commercial heart of Aspen Hill.The United States Census Bureau, defines Aspen Hill as a Census-Designated Place located at 39°6' North, 77°5' West. In the 2000 Census Bureau Gazetteer, Aspen Hill was located at   (39.088525, -77.080267) .The United States Geological Survey definition of Aspen Hill is centered at  , somewhat different from either of the Census Bureau's definitions.Other organizations, such as the Aspen Hill Civic Association, Inc., have their own definitions.

Olney, Maryland     Olney, a census-designated place and an unincorporated area of Montgomery County, Maryland, USA, is located in the north central part of the county, twenty miles (32 km) north of Washington, D.C. It was largely agricultural until the 1960s, when growth of the Washington suburbs led to its conversion into a mostly residential area. As generally defined, Olney had a total population of 31,438 in the 2000 census.  In July 2007, Money magazine ranked Olney as 17 (the highest ranked town in Maryland) out of the top 100 in its "America's Best Places To Live" edition. HistoryOriginally known as Mechanicsville, the village which became Olney was established in 1800. The area was mostly farmland, but it soon began attracting artisans. Early residents Sarah Brooke and Dr. Charles Farquhar were devotees of the English poet William Cowper, and named their home after the poet's hometown. The area was in turn named for their home, which still stands and is known as the Olney House.The Brooke family held the largest tracts of land in Olney, whose central village was at the intersection of the Rockville to Baltimore road, and the one which connected Washington with Westminster, Maryland, to the north. The Quaker community in Sandy Spring thrived just to Olney's east. The Sandy Spring Museum is a historical museum featuring educational programs and displays. St. John's Episcopal Church was established in 1842 and survives to this day.After the siege of Washington by the British in 1814 during the War of 1812, President Madison and his family passed through Olney en route to taking refuge in the neighboring town of Brookeville. Although not as involved in the Civil War as areas of Maryland to the west, Olney residents still experienced the tug-of-war between loyalty to the plantation economy of the South and to the Federal government in Maryland's midst. GeographyAs an unincorporated area, Olney's boundaries are not officially defined. The United States Census Bureau defines a Census-Designated Place of Olney centered at 39°9' North and 77°5' West.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.    History College Park was developed beginning in 1889 near the Maryland Agricultural College (later the University of Maryland) and the  College Station stop of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The suburb was incorporated in 1945 and included the subdivisions of College Park, Lakeland, Berwyn, Oak Spring, Branchville, Daniel's Park, and Hollywood.  The original College Park subdivision was first plotted in 1872 by Eugene Campbell. The area remained undeveloped and was re-platted in 1889 by John O. Johnson and Samuel Curriden, Washington real estate developers. The original   tract was divided into a grid-street pattern with long, narrow building lots, with a standard lot size of   by  . College Park developed rapidly, catering to those who were seeking to escape the crowded Washington, D.C., as well as to a rapidly expanding staff of college faculty and employees. College Park originally included single-family residences constructed in the Shingle, Queen Anne, and Stick styles, as well as modest vernacular dwellings.  Commercial development increased in the 1920s, aided by the increased automobile traffic and the growing campus along Baltimore Avenue / Route 1.  By the late 1930s, most of the original subdivision had been partially developed. Several fraternities and sororities from the University of Maryland built houses in the neighborhood. After World War II, construction consisted mostly of infill of ranch and split-level houses. After incorporation in 1945, the city continued to grow and build a municipal center in 1959.   The Lakeland neighborhood was developed beginning in 1892 around the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, whose Branchville and Calvert Road depots were located approximately one mile to the north and south, respectively. Lakeland was created by Edwin Newman, who improved the original   located to the west of the railroad. He also built a number of the original homes, a small town hall, and a general store. The area was originally envisioned as a resort-type community around Lake Artemesia. However, due to the flood-prone, low-lying topography, the neighborhood attracted a lower-income population became an area for African-American settlement. Around 1900, the Baltimore Gold Fish Company built five artificial lakes in the area to spawn goldfish and rare species of fish. A one-room school was built in 1903 for the African-American population; a new school was built in 1925. The Berwyn neighborhood was developed beginning about 1885 adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It was created by Francis Shannabrook, a Pennsylvanian who purchased a tract of land between Baltimore Avenue and the railroad tracks. Shannabrook established a small depot, built a general store, and erected approximately 15 homes in the area to attract moderate-income families looking to move out of Washington. The neighborhood began to grow after 1900 when the City and Suburban Electric Railway entered the area. By 1925 there were approximately 100 single-family homes; mostly two-story, wood-frame buildings. The community housing continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s with one story bungalows, capes, and victorians, and later grew to include raised ranches and split level homes. The Daniels Park neighborhood was developed beginning in 1905 on the east and west sides of the City and Suburban Electric Railway in north College Park. Daniels Park was created by Edward Daniels on   of land. This small residential subdivision was improved with single-family houses arranged along a grid pattern of streets. The houses range in style from American Foursquares to bungalows, and were built between 1905 and the 1930s. The Hollywood neighborhood was developed beginning in the early 20th century along the City and Suburban Electric Railway. Edward Daniels, the developer of Daniels Park, planned the Hollywood subdivision as a northern extension of that earlier community. Development in Hollywood was slow until after World War II when Albert Turner acquired large tracts of the northern part of the neighborhood in the late 1940s.  Turner was able to develop and market brick and frame three-bedroom bungalows beginning in 1950. By 1952, an elementary school had been built. The Hollywood Park, a   facility along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, is operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.  Spring TrainingIn 1943, the Washington Senators held Spring Training camp in College Park. In order to conserve rail transport during World War II, the 1943 Spring Training was limited to an area east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River.  September 2001 tornado   On September 24, 2001, a violent, multiple-vortex F3 tornado hit the area. This storm moved at peak intensity through the University of Maryland, College Park campus, and then moved parallel to I-95 through the Laurel area, where F3 damage was also noted. The damage path from this storm was measured at   in length, and this tornado caused two deaths and 55 injuries, along with $101 million in property damage. The two deaths were sisters who died when their car was picked up and hurled over a building before being slammed to the ground; both young women were University of Maryland students.This tornado was part of the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., tornado outbreak of 2001, one of the most dramatic recent tornado events to directly affect the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.The first tornado of the outbreak was also the strongest – an F4 (see Fujita scale) tornado that left a  -long damage path through rural Culpeper and Fauquier Counties in Virginia. Weak (F1) tornadoes east of Warrenton, and just west of Dulles International Airport soon followed.A second supercell to the southeast spawned the family of tornadoes that moved through Washington. A first tornado (F0) was confirmed in the Quantico and Prince William Forest Park areas; this was soon followed by an F1 tornado that left a  -long path parallel to I-95 and I-395 through Franconia, western Alexandria and Arlington. This tornado dissipated near the west end of the Mall in Washington, D.C., and was followed by many reports of funnel clouds. This same storm produced the F3 tornado that roared through College Park.

Both students and city residents have decried the city's lack of amenities and poor sense of place. In 2002, the city and county passed the Route 1 Sector Plan, which allowed and encouraged mixed use development on College Park's main roadway.Recent projects like the East Campus Redevelopment Initiative, the University View and Northgate Condos give many in the community hope that the city may one day be like other notable college towns around the country, with a vibrant downtown and a diverse population. A full list of current projects in the pipeline can be found on the City of College Park's Economic Development Updates.The University of Maryland's Student Government Association sponsored a design charrette in April 2006 to envision the future of College Park.

Occasionally, University of Maryland students plan voter registration drives and seek to elect one of their own to the city council.  City residents, including students living within the city are eligible  to run for city council if they are over the age of 21.  Over the past twenty years there have been multiple attempts, none of which were successful until Marcus Afzali won a seat in 2009.  1993 – Dana L. Loewenstein & Michael J. Moore – Perhaps the most controversial of all student races was that of Loewenstein, a former president of the Panhellenic Association, the sorority umbrella organization at the university.  A year after she had lost the election, she was charged with 16 counts of perjury, 16 counts of aiding and advising to falsely register voters and faced a maximum prison sentence of over 200+ years.  Ms. Loewenstein's opponent in the council race, Michael Smith, joined former council member Chester Joy in filing a complaint with the Prince George's County Board of Elections days before the Nov. 2 election.  The complaint alleged that 16 of her sorority pledges lived in one district but registered in another.  The complaint was turned over to the state's attorney, who filed criminal charges against Loewenstein a year after she lost the election.  The complaint alleged that all of the pledges lived in on-campus dorms but used the Sigma Delta Tau house address as their residence.  At trial, the 16 sorority pledges testified they signed the registration cards during their first meeting, when they were probationary members.  Loewenstein was found not guilty by the Circuit Court.    2001 – Mike Mann & Daniel Dorfman – In November 2001, Michael Mann  and Daniel Dorfman, sought the two District 3 seats on the College Park City Council.  Campaigning against incumbent Eric Olson and for an open seat created by then-councilman Brayman's decision to run for mayor, the two campaigned heavily to inform students there was a council race going on that year, and registered over 700 students to vote in the municipal election. Despite their hard work and an almost year-long campaign, they were defeated.    2007 – Nick Aragon – In January 2007, Nick Aragon lost a special election for the city council.  Two incumbents created a vacancy when they were elected to higher county offices.  In turn, the city was forced to hold a special election after the November 2006 elections.  The city chose an election date during the university's winter recess, a time when many students were away from the city.  With some help from the Student Government Association (SGA)  and an endorsement by College Park Mayor Steve Brayman, the Aragon campaign encouraged students to use absentee ballots, although few actually did, and Aragon lost the election.    2009- Marcus Afzali- Marcus Afzali, a 24-year-old doctoral student in the Department of Government and Politics at UMD, won a seat on the city council representing District 4 in November 2009. Afzali attributed displays of "energy"--exemplified by taking time to knock on doors and reach out to residents—as the cause behind his success. The 2009 election is notable not only for Afzali's performance at the polls, but for the fact that both District 4 incumbents lost.

Governor of Maryland    The Governor of Maryland heads the executive branch of the government of Maryland, and he is the commander-in-chief of the state's National Guard units. The Governor is the highest-ranking official in the state, and he has a broad range of appointive powers in both the State and local governments, as specified by the Maryland Constitution. Because of the extent of these constitutional powers, the Governor of Maryland has been ranked as being among the most powerful Governors in the United States.  The current Governor is Martin O'Malley, a Democrat and a former mayor of Baltimore who defeated the Republican incumbent Robert Ehrlich in the November 2006 election.  O'Malley won reelection in November 2010, in a rematch against Ehrlich. Selection and qualificationsLike most state chief executives in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, he can run any number of times, but not more than twice in a row.    This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election.  If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body.  The Governor, like all state-wide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.  Functions and responsibilitiesAs the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor heads the executive branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.  AppropriationsEvery year, the Governor must present a proposed budget to the Maryland General Assembly. After receiving the proposed budget, the Assembly is then allowed to decrease any portion of the budget for the executive branch, but it may never increase it or transfer funds between executive departments. The Assembly may, however, increase funds for the Legislative and Judicial branches of government.  The Governor has the power to veto any law that is passed by the Assembly, including a line item veto, which can be used to strike certain portions of appropriations bills. The Legislature then has the power to override a Governor's veto by vote of three-fifths (60%) of the number of members in each house. The Governor also sits on the Board of Public Works, whose other two members are the Comptroller and the Treasurer. This Board has broad powers in overseeing and approving the spending of state funds. They must approve state expenditures of all general funds and capital improvement funds, excluding expenditures for the construction of state roads, bridges, and highways. It has the power to solicit loans on its own accord either to meet a deficit or in anticipation of other revenues, in addition to approving expenditures of funds from loans authorized by the General Assembly.  Appointment powersThe Governor appoints almost all military and civil officers of the State government, subject to advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate. The Governor also appoints certain boards and commissions in each of the 24 Counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and he appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of Attorney General and Comptroller.  Should a vacancy arise in the General Assembly, the Governor also fills that vacancy, though the Governor must choose from among the recommendations of the local party organization to which the person leaving the vacancy belonged.  Any officer appointed by the Governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there is a legitimate cause for removal. Among the most prominent of the Governor's appointees are the 24 secretaries and heads of departments that make up the Governor's Cabinet, also known as the Executive Council.  Executive CouncilThe Governor of Maryland is the Chairman of the Governor's Executive Council (or Cabinet) which coordinates all state government functions. This is composed of the following members, all of whom, except the Lieutenant Governor, are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate as heads of executive departments:     Lieutenant Governor, currently Anthony G. Brown Secretary of State, currently John P. McDonough, Esq. Secretary of Aging, currently Gloria G. Lawlah Secretary of Agriculture, currently Earl F. (Buddy) Hance Secretary of Budget and Management, currently T. Eloise Foster Secretary of Business and Economic Development, currently Christian S. Johansson Secretary of Disabilities, currently Catherine A. Raggio State Superintendent of Schools (appointed by the State Board of Education to direct the Maryland State Department of Education), currently Lillian M. Lowery, Ed.D. Secretary of Environment, currently Robert M. Summers, Ph.D. Secretary of General Services, currently Alvin C. Collins Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene, currently Joshua M. Sharfstein, M.D. Secretary of Housing and Community Development, currently Raymond A. Skinner Secretary of Human Resources, currently Theodore Dallas Secretary of Information Technology, currently Elliot H. Schlanger Secretary of Juvenile Services, currently Sam J. Abed Secretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, currently Leonard J. Howie III, Esq. Secretary of Natural Resources, currently John R. Griffin Secretary of Planning, currently Richard E. Hall Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services, currently Gary D. Maynard Secretary of State Police (commanding officer of the Maryland State Police), currently Col. Marcus L. Brown Secretary of Transportation, currently Darrell B. Mobley (acting) Secretary of Veterans Affairs, currently Edward J. Chow, Jr. Secretary of Higher Education (head of the Maryland Higher Education Commission), currently Danette Gerald Howard, Ph.D. Adjutant General (head of the Maryland Military Department), currently Maj. Gen. James A. Adkins  Other members of the Governor's Staff may be invited to Cabinet meetings as "attendees". The Governor also oversees several sub-cabinets that coordinate the activities of a certain function of state government that involves several state departments or agencies.  Currently, these are the Base Realignment and Closure Subcabinet, BayStat Subcabinet, Chesapeake Bay cabinet, Children's Cabinet, Governor's Subcabinet for International Affairs, Smart Growth Subcabinet, and Workforce Creation Subcabinet.  Other powers and responsibilitiesThe Governor is the commander-in-chief of the military forces of the State: the Maryland National Guard and Air National Guard and the Maryland Defense Force, except when these forces have been called into Federal service, which the Federal government has the authority to do. In times of public emergency, the Governor may exercise emergency powers, including the mobilization of these military forces. In the area of criminal justice, the Governor may grant pardons to criminals, commute the sentences of prisoners, or remit fines and forfeitures imposed on people who have been convicted, jailed, or fined for violations of state laws. In both these areas, and a variety of others, the Governor sits on state and interstate boards and commissions with varying powers. The Governor is also obligated to report on the condition of the state at any time during the year, though this traditionally happens in a State of the State Address each January.  The Governor's StaffIn addition to the various departments and agencies under gubernatorial control, the Governor has an executive staff that assist in coordinating the executive duties. This staff is led by a Chief of Staff, and includes five offices: Intergovernmental Relations, Legal Counsel, Legislative and Policy, Press, and the Governor's Office in Washington, DC. The Chief of Staff has a number of deputies to assist in running these departments. The Governor's staff is appointed and therefore largely exempt from state civil service laws.  History and Evolution of the OfficeDuring the Colonial period, Maryland's Proprietors, the Lords of Baltimore, who generally remained in England, chose who would serve as the Governor of Maryland on their behalf. Between 1692, when the Baltimores lost control, and 1715, Maryland was a direct Royal Colony, and the Governor was appointed by the British Monarch. The Lords of Baltimore regained their Royal Charter in 1715, and then they resumed choosing the Governors until the beginning of the American Revolution.  The first Governor chosen to break this chain of Colonial Governors was Thomas Johnson (1732–1819), who took office on March 21, 1777.   Under the Maryland Constitution of 1776, the Governor was chosen for one-year terms by both houses of the General Assembly. An 1838 constitutional amendment allowed voters to elect the Governor to three-year terms from one of three rotating gubernatorial districts: eastern, southern, and western. At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the Governor. The Maryland Constitution of 1851 lengthened the Governor's term of office from three to four years, which brought elections for Governor in line with elections for Federal offices that occur only in even years. Finally, the Constitution of 1864 eliminated the rotating gubernatorial election districts and, since the election of 1868, the Governor has been elected by all the voters of the state.  From 1777 to 1870, the Governor resided in Jennings House in Annapolis. Since 1870, the Governor has resided in the Government House, a Georgian mansion adjacent to the Maryland State House. In addition to being the residence for the Governor and his family, Government House has a number of public rooms that are used by the Governor on official occasions. Spiro T. Agnew, who was the Governor of Maryland from 1967–1969, later served as the Vice-President of the United States for a time under President Richard M. Nixon, and Agnew is, thus far, the highest-ranking Marylander in the history of the United States.    Following his resignation due to charges of corruption, Agnew's official gubernatorial portrait was removed Damnatio memoriae from the Maryland State House Governor's Reception Room from 1979 until 1995. Then-Governor Parris Glendening stated that in re-including Agnew's portrait that it was not up to anyone to alter history, whether for good or bad, citing Nineteen Eighty-Four.      A potential factor leading to Agnew's corruption was, at the time he took office, the governor's salary was only $15,000 per year, leading to the "need" to supplement his income through kickbacks. In 1971, the office of Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, which had existed for only a few years in the 1860s, was re-instituted by an amendment to the Maryland Constitution. The Lieutenant Governor is a weak office compared to other counterparts (in other states including Texas, the Lieutenant Governor is the President of the State's Senate, while in California the Lieutenant Governor assumes all of the Governor's powers when the sitting Governor is out of the state), as it only possesses the powers and duties that the Governor assigns to him or her. The Lieutenant Governor is elected on the same ballot with the Governor, and to the same term-of-office as the Governor. The Lieutenant Governor succeeds to the Governorship only if there is a vacancy in that office.  Despite the Governor and Lieutenant Governor being elected on the same party ticket, very often there have been public rifts between the two; for instance Gov. Marvin Mandel and Lt. Gov. Blair Lee IV; Gov. Harry R. Hughes and Lt. Gov. Samuel W. Bogley III; Gov. Schaefer and Lt. Gov. Melvin A. Steinberg., and Gov. Parris Glendening and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.   No Lieutenant Governor of Maryland has yet been elected as the Governor in future elections, or permanently succeeded to the Governor's office due to a vacancy (which would be created by the resignation, death, or removal of the sitting Governor), although Blair Lee III served as acting Governor from June 4, 1977 until January 15, 1979 while Governor Marvin Mandel was serving a sentence for mail fraud and racketeering (consequently, in a modern example of  Damnatio memoriae, Mandel's official gubernatorial portrait was not hung in the Maryland State House Governor's Reception Room until 1993).  As of 2010, Maryland has yet to have been served by a female Governor.   However, women were the runners-up in four gubernatorial elections (in 1974, 1994, 1998, and 2002).  In addition, one woman has served as the Lieutenant Governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, under Gov. Parris Glendening from 1995 to 2003.  Another woman, Kristen Cox, who was the Secretary of Disabilities, unsuccessfully ran for Lieutenant Governor as the running mate of the incumbent Governor Robert Ehrlich, when the Lieutenant Governor at that time, Michael Steele, left office to run for the U.S. Senate. Cox was a unique person to run for that office, not only because she is a woman, but also because she is legally blind.

List of Governors of Maryland  Number of Governors of Maryland by party affiliation  Party Governors  Democratic 29  Federalist 9  Democratic-Republican 9  Republican 6  No Party 5  Whig 3  National Republican 2  American 1  Unionist 1  The following is a list of the Governors of Maryland from independence to the present day. The Governor of Maryland heads the executive branch of the government of the U.S. state of Maryland and is commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.    He or she is the highest-ranking official in the state, and the constitutional powers of Maryland's Governors make them among the most powerful in the United States. Since the American Revolution, Maryland has had a number of state constitutions that have specified different terms of office and methods of selection of its Governors. Under the constitution of 1776, the Governors were appointed by the legislature to one year terms. An 1838 constitutional amendment allowed the direct election of Governors to three-year terms, although the Governors came from rotating election districts. The terms were lengthened to four years in the 1851 Constitution and the election districts were abolished in the 1864 version.

Scouting in Maryland  Scouting in Maryland has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving millions of youth with activities that have adapted to the changing cultural environment but have always been rooted in an active outdoor program. Early history (1910-1950)The 1923 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meeting was held at Baltimore, Maryland. In the early 1920s, there were several camps named Rodney in the Delmarva area. However, the current Rodney Scout Reservation was established in 1921. Recent history (1950-1990)   Boy Scouts of America There are six Boy Scouts of America local councils in Maryland, all within the Northeast Region. Baltimore Area Council  The Baltimore Area Council includes thirteen districts:  Arrowhead District Thurgood Marshall District (formerly Babe Ruth District) Carroll District Chesapeake District Dulaney District Four Rivers District Harford District Hopkins District National Pike District Reginald F. Lewis District (formerly Scoutreach District) The Capitol District Pathfinders District Learning For Life District  Baltimore Area Council partners with approximately 800 community based organizations providing programs to more than 35,000 youth each year. Baltimore Area Council operates three full service Scout Shops either directly or thru license with the National Council, Boy Scouts of America in Baltimore City, Hanover and Whiteford in Harford County, Maryland. The Harford Scout Shop is located in Camp Saffran at Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation at 1929 Susquehanna Hall Road Whiteford, Maryland. The Dorsey Road Scout Shop is located at 7502 Connelley Dr Ste 117, Hanover, Maryland. The Baltimore Scout Shop is actually located directly across the street from the Council's Shapiro Scout Service Center in the Stieff Silver Building at 800 Wyman Park Drive, Baltimore Maryland.  The Council also operates a Help Desk that serves Scout volunteers and Scout parents at the Baltimore Scout Shop.In 2008, Baltimore Area Council announced ten top initiative programs to highlight the Boy Scouts of America 100th Anniversary in 2010. The Top Ten Initiatives are: Star-Spangled Camporee at Ft. McHenry and surrounding City Parks, Scout Sunday And Sabbath, Anniversary Black Tie Gala, Gathering of Eagles, Flag Ceremonies, the 100 Great Moments in Baltimore Area Scouting History, Birthday Card Contest, Scouting Mural/Mosaic Project and the 100th Anniversary Service Project.In February 2009, the Star-Spangled Banner Flag or the Great Garrison Flag (also known as the 15 Star Flag) was officially adopted as the Official U.S. Flag of the Baltimore Area Council, Boy Scouts of America by authority of the Council Executive Board.  A public ceremony was conducted on February 8, 2009, on the occasion of the 99th Anniversary of the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America in Washington, D.C., by William D. Boyce, a Chicago publisher.  Representatives of Scout Units, Districts, the Council and the public were on hand to commemorate the adoption at the Shapiro Scout Service Center.  This was done in anticipation of the bicentennial commemoration at Fort McHenry in 2014 of the battle which inspired Francis Scott Key to write his inspirational poem which later became our national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner.Baltimore Area Council operates a Scout camp in Harford County, Maryland known as Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation.  Website:      Broad Creek land was first acquired in 1946.  Over   of land are owned and/or operated by BAC.  It has operated as a Scout camp since 1948 and is one of the five largest blocks of contiguous forest in the traditional (western shore) Baltimore metropolitan area, and the largest such private forested area.  In 2009, a new Rosenberg Welcome Center, formerly the Reservation HQ, and the expansion of the Dining Hall Pavilion at Camp Oest were constructed to accommodate attendance growth and goals in the 2008-2012 Baltimore Area Council Strategic Plan.Broad Creek has three primary camps, two secondary camps, plus a large natural area including the largest hemlock forest east of the mountains in Maryland.  Several pine plantations were  planted in 1949-51 and felled in 2006-7 due to beetle infestations.The primary camps are called Camp Saffran (named after Frederick A. Saffran), Camp Spencer (named after William B. Spencer), and Camp Oest (named after E. Wallace Oest). Camps Saffran and Spencer operate as Boy Scout summer camps and Camp Oest as a Cub Scout resident summer camp.  Camp Saffran's Middle Ridge area features a high ropes "COPE" challenge course and zip line.Of the secondary camps, Camp Cone's remote Houck Lodge is often used by non-scout groups and for training events and, along with Camp Finney, the forests are used for hiking, backpack camping, and orienteering, with paddling access to both the mile-long Lake Straus waters and to the huge Conowingo Reservoir (Susquehanna River).  All of the camps in BCMSR are named for a person with an early history of long service to the council.The hemlocks stand includes the largest Eastern Hemlock in the state of Maryland (officially designated as of July 3, 2007.)

Barton, Maryland   Barton is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States, located along the Georges Creek Valley. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 457 at the 2010 census. History  The Reverend William Shaw, a Methodist minister settled on the site of Barton in 1794. His son, William Shaw Jr. laid out the town in 1853, naming it for his father's hometown, Barton-upon-Humber, England.The discovery of coal in the area attracted more settlers. They came from Scotland, Ireland and Germany, eager to work in the mines. In 1853, the first shipment of coal was made on the newly-built Georges Creek Railroad.  Eventually, all the deep coal mines had been abandoned and replaced by strip mines, several of which are still in operation and can be seen from the town. Today, most families in Barton are supported by other types of employment.The first gristmill powered by a water wheel was built on Moores Run by Henry Ingram. It was about 200 to 300 ft. from the confluence of Georges Creek. The mill at Moores Run was owned and tended by Mathias Ball. Ball also owned and ran a tannery at Butcher Run in Barton. The second gristmill was built at Mill Run south of Barton, it was called the Morrison Mill, and was owned by John Morrison. The Morrison Mill was located where Mill Run flows into Georges Creek. John Haymaker also tended the Hockenberry Mill before Hockenberry took over.  The third mill was the Shaw Mill, built by the Shaw family.  It was a large mill built of stone at Moscow. It was torn down in the summer or fall of 1961.Major Barton-area coal companies in the 19th century:  American Coal Company, owner of the Swanton and Caledonia Mines. Their coal tipples were located right in Barton and the mines were located on the mountain on the west side of Barton. Davis & Rieman Co. Piedmont Coal & Iron Co., located up Temperance Row on the east side of the mountain. Potomac Coal Co., located up Moore’s Run. The first mine was located about ½ mile from Dogwood Flat and the No. 2 mine was about 1-1/4 mile up the run. Owned by the Union Mining Co. Swanton Mining Co. George’s Creek Mining Co. Barton Coal Mining Co., located at in the top of Moores Run.  The Barton Coal Company plane (or cable railway) was built in 1854 and was engineered by O.D. Robbins. It remained in operation until March 21, 1898.  The next week the tract, cables and mining equipment were removed. Along with the major mines, there were also many small family-owned mines on the family farms, which catered to the local coal trade.The Pickell Mine was located on the west side of Barton towards Moscow. Its tipple was not located in town.The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad, successor to the Georges Creek Railroad, opened a train station in Barton in 1889.  The station was demolished in the mid-20th century.Today Barton has four churches and many volunteer groups. There is a lighted ball field, a playground, and two parks for use by citizens. Barton has survived floods and fires and still maintains its peaceful and congenial atmosphere. Each year the town celebrates itself with a Party in the Park. That get-together showcases crafts, food, entertainment, and a parade through the center of town.Shaw Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Population trends Population decline from 1950–1990 was due to a string of industrial plant closures. Unwilling to meet union demands, plants such as Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Allegany Munitions and Celanese closed down and relocated. The 1987 closure of the Kelly Springfield Tire Plant marked a turning point, as the last major manufacturing plant in the city limits to close its doors.The population of the city has continued to decline since 1990, with the 2010 census population of 20,859 the lowest since the 1900 census.References:  For 1870–1960: Allegany County data Historical Census Browser For 1930–2000: See Geostat Center Collection: County and City Data Books (1930-2000) For 1830–1873: See Lowdermilk For 1900–1920: See Maryland Manual, 1928, Volume 144, page 202   2010 censusAs of the census    of 2010, there were 20,859 people, 9,223 households, and 4,982 families residing in the city.

Cliffs and talus of the two mountains' Tuscarora quartzite caprock are prominent within the Narrows.  These geological features provide Cumberland a western backdrop of the two mountains and the narrow gap between them.The Cumberland Narrows acts as a western gateway from Cumberland to the Appalachian Plateau and the Ohio River Valley beyond.  The Old National Road, now Alternate U.S. 40, passes through the Narrows, along with the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line between Baltimore/Washington and Pittsburgh, now part of the CSX system, and a former line of the Western Maryland Railroad, now used by the steam- and diesel-powered excursion trains of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad.A prominent rocky outcropping at the south end of Wills Mountain in the Cumberland Narrows is known as Lover's Leap. History  Cumberland is named after the son of King George II, Prince William, the Duke of Cumberland. It is built on the site of the old Fort Cumberland, the starting point for British General Edward Braddock's ill-fated attack on the French stronghold of Fort Duquesne (located on the site of present-day Pittsburgh) during the French and Indian War. (See Braddock expedition.)Cumberland was also an outpost of Colonel George Washington during the French and Indian War and his first military headquarters was built here. Washington later returned to Cumberland as President in 1794 to review troops that had been assembled to thwart the Whiskey Rebellion.  Cumberland was a key road, railroad and canal junction during the 19th century and at one time the second largest city in Maryland (second to the port city of Baltimore — hence its nickname "The Queen City"). The surrounding hillsides provided coal, iron ore and timber that helped supply the Industrial Revolution. In addition, the city was a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics and tinplate. However, following World War II, it began to lose much of its industrial importance and its population declined from 39,483 in the 1940 census to fewer than 22,000 today.

Law enforcement The city is primarily policed by the Cumberland Police Department (CPD). The CPD is a full-service agency consisting of a patrol section, detective bureau, specialized services, and other services. It is occasionally aided by the Maryland State Police and the Allegany County Sheriff's Office as directed by authority.The Cumberland Police Department was founded by an act of legislation in March 1852. In 1907, Officer August Baker was killed by gunfire while trying to apprehend a drunk and disorderly William Burns from an area that is now known as South Wineow Street. Subsequently, after the officer's death, an angry mob broke Burns out of jail using a telephone pole. After gaining entry into the jail, the mob beat the murder suspect, Burns, almost to death. They then dragged him into the street, and shot him twelve times to death.   In 2009, the CPD was involved in the investigation of a local homicide, which is uncommon for the area.  The suspect was investigated by CPD C3I detectives and ultimately plead guilty to the first-degree murder.   In February 2010, the CPD in conjunction with C3I investigated a double-homicide that garnered state-wide attention. The Cumberland Police Department is currently led by Chief Charles H. Hinnant, who is assisted by one Captain and five Lieutenants.  The CPD is a progressive department and has a diverse Specialized Unit Section with the following teams:   K-9 Unit Bicycle Patrol Motorcycle Patrol Cumberland Emergency Response Team (CERT) Combined County Criminal Investigation Unit (C3I) School Resources C3I Narcotics Task Force Honor Guard   State representationThe North Branch Correctional Institution, operated by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, is located in unincorporated Allegany County, near Cumberland.

Frostburg, Maryland       For the NSA computer, see FROSTBURG.  Frostburg is a city in Allegany County, Maryland, United States and is located at the head of the Georges Creek Valley. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 9,002 at the 2010 census. Located   west of Cumberland, the town is one of the first cities on the "National Road", US 40, and the western terminus of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad. Since 1991, the city has been served by Interstate 68.The City of Frostburg has an approximate year-round population of 8,075. In addition, 5,400 students attend Frostburg State University, a public university within the University System of Maryland.Frostburg was originally called Mount Pleasant until 1820, when the government developed a postal service, and the town was renamed Frostburg. GeographyFrostburg is located at   (39.654687, −78.927773). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of  , all of it land.   Frostburg is located in the Allegheny Mountains on the eastern slope of Big Savage Mountain. The closest cities to Frostburg are Cumberland, Maryland,   to the east, and Morgantown, West Virginia,   to the west. ClimateDue to its average elevation of   above sea level and location near the Allegheny Front, Frostburg has a colder, wetter climate than much of the rest of the state. Under the Köppen climate classification, it has a humid continental climate (Dfb), with cold, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The daily mean temperature ranges from   in January to   in July. Sub-  occur on 3.8 nights per year, while, on average, there are 1.4 days with  + highs, though these are not recorded every year. Due to orographic lift, driving conditions on I-68 and US 40 can be very hazardous despite timely state and local road maintenance services, and the town averages just over   of snowfall a season; significant falls can occur as early as October and as late as May. Frostburg's greatest one-month snowfall was   in January 1978, and Frostburg is second in Maryland for the greatest single-season snowfall with a total of   in the winter of 1995–96.   History 19th centuryFrostburg had its beginnings back in 1811 when surveying began for the National Pike, a road used to transport crops and raw materials to East Coast markets. President Thomas Jefferson had authorized construction of the road in 1806. Meshach Frost built the first house in present-day Frostburg in 1812 and named it Highland Hall. This building was a popular stopping point for celebrities and dignitaries who traveled the National Pike. This would be followed by the Franklin Hotel and other hotels.The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal reached Cumberland in 1842 and 1850, respectively. Consequently, travel on the National Pike saw a steady decline, although travel through Frostburg did not. City of Frostburg, MD. "Local History." Accessed 2010-01-12.  Coal mining was the first major economic draw, but the industry faced problems in its early manifestation. The mountains of western Maryland and Frostburg proved to make transportation of coal very difficult. Not until the completion of the railroads did the coal industry in Frostburg began to flourish. The first major coal producer was Meshech Frost, who owned a significant amount of land for mining and founded the Frostburg Coal Company. This eventually was sold to the much larger Consolidated Coal Company.Structures from the coal industry's dominant period still remain. One of the major freight depots for coal is located at 19 Depot St. in Frostburg and is one the few remaining depots in western Maryland. The Mount Savage Railroad was the first to build a rail line to Frostburg in 1852, and it connected to the B&O Railroad in Cumberland, as well as the C&O Canal. The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad (C&P) took over the Mount Savage line in 1854, and expanded with the construction of a tunnel under Frostburg, and a rail line southward to Piedmont, West Virginia. This railroad and tunnel were used to transport coal between Frostburg and George's Creek.  Another major economic turn for Frostburg was the manufacture of fire brick beginning in 1864, utilizing the high-grade fire clays which are found in the area. One of the main businesses that formed was the Big Savage Fire Brick Company, still one of the main suppliers of fire bricks on the East Coast.  President Truman's visitAfter his presidency, Harry Truman was of surprisingly meager economic status. He did, however, receive a Chrysler automobile as a gift, and decided that he and his wife would use it to its maximum potential. On Father's Day in 1953, his travels took him to Frostburg, and the town rolled out the red carpet. In an attempt not to come across as being too good for people, the Trumans were very kind, signed autographs, and talked with people who recognized them. Harry Truman even went so far as to visit a bedridden elderly woman who had broken her hip. The Trumans also visited the Princess Restaurant. This is the only family-owned business from the time period that still exists, and it attracts customers with its Truman photographs and the Truman booth, where the Trumans dined.  History of Frostburg State UniversityIn 1898 the Maryland General Assembly authorized State Normal School #2 and a $20,000 appropriation to construct a building, though no money to buy land. The money for the land was collected among local citizens, many of them coal miners and their families.Two years later the first building, Old Main, opened. Two years after that, the first classes were held. The only available course of study at that point was a two-year elementary-education program. In 1904, the first class graduated.In 1934, State Normal School #2 introduced its first four-year program. Nearly 30 years later (1963), the school finally was renamed Frostburg State College. In the next ten years more programs sprouted, including the university’s first graduate program (Master's of Science in Management).In 1987, Frostburg State College joined the Maryland state university system and was renamed Frostburg State University. FSU celebrated its centennial in 1998.  Major events Fires  August 1996. An accidental fire destroyed three buildings on East Main Street while serving a devastating blow to seven businesses.

Luke, Maryland     Luke is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States located along the Georges Creek Valley. Known originally as West Piedmont,  the town is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 65 at the 2010 census.  History  The town of Luke was settled in the early 1770s.  Luke is located along the Potomac River basin at the foot of Backbone Mountain and is home to the largest private employer in Allegany County. Among the first settlers to arrive were the Davis brothers, who established a saw mill where the town of Luke now stands. The mill provided cross-ties to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as it pushed its rails westward through the Piedmont area of what is now West Virginia. When the railroad suspended building in the 1880s, the Davis brothers disbanded and sold their property to the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company.About that same time, William Luke and two of his sons arrived. They assiduously applied themselves to developing the place they had adopted. When the railroad needed a name for the stop it established there, it happily accepted "Luke".Over the next several decades, Luke prospered with the operation of the paper mill, the influx of other "heavy" industrial concerns, and the establishment of the usual supporting Mom and Pop businesses. Nearby, along the Savage River, there was a gun factory that provided muskets with bayonets for the United States Army at Harpers Ferry.  Luke was also home of an automobile manufacturing plant where the Maryland Steamer was produced  as well as a post card factory.With Luke's growth came citizens' concerns about educational and social issues. Schooling in private homes and business buildings was relocated to a two-room schoolhouse. Growing enrollment in the first through eighth grades brought about construction of a fine new school that opened in September, 1913. It served the town well for forty-six years, sending well educated students off to Bruce High School in Westernport. When the school closed in 1959, the building was converted for use as the town's administrative offices—the City Building.Luke is home for a NewPage Corporation facility, successor to the Westvaco Corporation and West Virginia Pulp and Paper Mill.  The mill has over a 200 million dollar economic impact on the local economy and supports the coal and rail industry as well as the trucking industry, all part of the Town of Luke's overall partnership with the mill to help the community grow.The United States lists the paper plant as one of the largest polluters of mercury in Maryland. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin.

Midland, Maryland     Midland is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States, located along the Georges Creek Valley. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 446 at the 2010 census.The town of Midland is   above sea level, is located   south of Frostburg, Maryland and   north of Lonaconing, Maryland.  Paradise Run and Neff's Run carry the precipitation from Dan's Mountain on the east to Georges Creek, while Squirrel Neck Run feeds it from the west off of Savage Mountain.  Some say that Midland derived its name from its location, some say it was named after the Midlands in Scotland by the Scottish settlers.Midland is the birthplace of the Emmy Award winning longtime American actress Suzanne Rogers, who has played the role of Maggie Simmons Horton on NBC's Days of our Lives continuously since 1973.Midland is proud of its two churches—St. Joseph's Catholic Church and Grace United Methodist Church. Both were established in 1891. The bells of St. Joe’s and the chimes of Grace ring out daily from the hill at the edge of town where the churches sit side by side.About 3 miles beyond the town's limits, anyone making the climb to the top of the magnificent outcropping known as Dan's Rock is rewarded with an incomparable view of the eastern end of the county and nearby West Virginia. Generations of townsfolk and visitors have marveled at the spectacular sunrises and sunsets seen from this highest point in Allegany County.Midland was founded in 1850 as a coal-mining community in the heart of the George's Creek Valley, once a major center of the nation’s coal industry. But coal production started to decline after World War I, and today only some strip mining remains as the last vestige of this once all important industry. Coal trains that once went through the town daily are gone now.Most of the original settlers came in response to the abundance of jobs available in the coal mines. Many were Irish, but German, Scottish, and Welsh names also are found in the early records of the town.Once a bustling town with big stores, a hotel, and an opera house, Midland today projects a friendly laid-back atmosphere. A convenience store offers the basic necessities, but major shopping is done in the larger communities of Frostburg, LaVale, and Cumberland. The post office in the heart of town is the gathering point for the townspeople to meet and chat. History The history of Midland is vague before 1850. According to the Heritage Press there were some early pioneers who lived in caves and covered wagons while building their log cabins in the area now known as Midland.  George Winters, an Englishman, who originally settled in Pennsylvania, later moved to Frederick, and then moved west to establish a home in Midland sometime before 1765.The VanBuskirk (Buskirk) family built a stone house in about 1790 about   south of Midland. Early Catholic services were held in this house, and worshipers traveled on foot from the surrounding area for   to attend.  This stone house was later inhabited by Miss Virginia Brummage.In the latter part of the 18th century, the Combs family settled on the farm which is now the home of Clarence O. Miller.In 1826 Henry Koontz built a greystone house of logs and stone gathered from the land surrounding the area. This home's later residents (1975) were Mrs. Marie Winters and her sister, Francis Winters.  Mr. Salem Koontz and his wife, Birdie, moved from the farm to their newly built colonial home in the Koontz orchard, which is now a part of Midland. This was later inhabited by Mrs. Arch "Sweetie" Dixon, granddaughter of Salem & Birdie, who was born in the house. Succeeding owners of this home were Mr. John Kenny and Mr. & Mrs. Gary Eagan. Thus, Midland was originally called "Koontz".Earlier writings regarding the early days of Midland refer to a Staup farm located on the present site of the town. One of the first dwelling, a log house, was located on Paradise Street opposite the home of William Kroll.  This house was occupied by a farmer and a woodsman named Staup. In 1863 the heirs of George Staup, Mary A., Peter and William, sold a tract of land to Thomas Gimmel for $7,000. This land was named "The resurvey of the Elk Lick". Later inhabitants of this home were Bob and Lucy Loar.The Firlie family bought many acres in this same vicinity, but failed to buy the mineral rights which, according to Carl Firlie of Cumberland, Maryland, were offered to his grandfather for an additional $100.Another early family of the area was the Cutters. In the 1850s Henry Cutter and his wife immigrated from Germany and built a log cabin on the site of the present Hartman farm. In this log cabin, in 1859, John Barney Cutter was born. He was one of 14 children.Around 1850, two enterprising Scottish brother, Alexander and Thomas Gimmel, organized the Hampshire and Baltimore Coal Company. The location of their mine was directly behind the site of the Midland School.  In 1859 they built a row of brick homes facing the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad. Only 2 of these houses are still standing, completely renovated.It was an opportune time for the founding of Midland, the youngest of the "Creek" or "Crick" towns. Westernport, Barton and Lonaconing had been settled much earlier. The Georges Creek Coal Company had built a railroad from Piedmont to Knapp's Meadow to link the newly opened coal fields with the Eastern city markets by way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad which had been extended from Cumberland to Piedmont in 1851. The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad, after purchasing the Georges Creek Coal and Iron Railroad, completed the laying of track from Cumberland to Knapp's Meadow so that the valley from Cumberland to Westernport, by way of Mt. Savage, had the means of transporting the coal.From 1874, the town steadily grew. Shortly after 1900 the Koontz Addition was filled with residences. The first grocery business was run by a man named Shearer. Later, Sandy Tennant built and operated an independent grocery business. Later there was a butcher shop owned and operated by John J.Devlin. This shop is now the town's Post Office. In 1900, C.T. Clayton began publishing a weekly newspaper in the Knights of Labor Hall.One of the early department stores operated by J. R. Poland dispensed news and advertised items in a small news sheet known as the Midland News. Coal mining From Frostburg to Westernport lay   of land that contained some of the richest semi-bituminous coal deposits in the country. The two principal veins were (1) the Pittsburgh or Big Vein deposit which was 14' high and 200' below the surface, and (2) the Tyson or Small Vein deposit which was up to 6' high and   below the surface.Little towns sprang up along the Georges Creek Valley, attracting new settlers who came to dig the coal. To an outsider, these towns would seem very much alike, but each had its own distinct character. Using pick and shovel, sometimes explosives, the Irish, Scots, Welsh and Germans descended into the bowels of the earth to extract the shiny black fuel from the underground vastness.Two Scotsmen, Alexander and Thomas Gimmel, organized the Hampshire and Baltimore Coal Company and opened a mine behind what later became Midland School. This mine would be bought by the George's Creek Coal Company who later leased it to Bob Loar and Charlie Eagan. In the 1930s, the mine was operated by the Sloan family from Lonaconing.The Medicine Mine was located about 1/2 mile out of town on the new Route 36, opposite the home of Mr. & Mrs. William Fisher. It was originally owned by the Midland Mining Company, which was run by William Sommerville. It was later sold to John Ashley who later sold it to "Tug" Hughes and Chalmer Winner.Number 8 Mine was on the hillside above the ball park. It was owned by the Consolidated Coal Co. of Pittsburgh. Arthur Winner remembers a wooden trestle that began near the Knippenberg home at the southern end of Railroad St. and crossed over Georges' Creek to Number 8.The largest mine of all was Ocean Mines just north of town on Route 936. It was also owned by the Consolidated Coal Company. It was a sprawling complex of buildings, sheds, and a large covered entrance structure. At one time the mines at Ocean and Klondike employed 1,500 men working three shifts. By 1900, about 5,000 men worked in the deep mines of George's Creek. The coal from Ocean Mines was used primarily by the large ocean liners because of its unique smokeless quality, thus the name "Ocean Mines".

Westernport, Maryland   Westernport is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States, located along the Georges Creek Valley. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,888 at the 2010 census. HistoryWesternport's first settlement is identified on a French military map dating from 1758. The map is currently on display at École Militaire in Paris. The settlement at that time had no name. By 1774, it was known as Hardscrabble because the rocky soil made planting difficult. Some time in the mid-1790s, the name was changed to Westernport, with the town being the western-most navigable port on the Potomac River. In the late 18th century and early to mid part of the 19th century, coal and timber was loaded onto flatboats where George's Creek empties into the Potomac, then floated down to near Great Falls, Virginia, where the goods were unloaded, the boats broken up to sell as lumber, and the operators walking back to Westernport. The town was incorporated in 1859.The Waverly Street Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.    The Meyer Site was listed in 1973.  Notable residents  Leo Mazzone, the well-known former pitching coach of the Baltimore Orioles who made his reputation in the same role with the Atlanta Braves, lived his entire childhood in Westernport. Although he was born on the West Virginia side of the North Branch Potomac River in Keyser, his parents lived in Westernport at the time.    Stephen Wheeler Downey, the "Father of the University of Wyoming", was born in Westernport in 1839.  He became a trustee and eventual president of the University of Wyoming from 1891–97.    Deborah "Debbie" Sue Phelps (nèe Davisson), the mother of the most decorated Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps, was raised in Westernport and attended Bruce High School.

It was named for the late Wilmer Stone, a noted forester who once owned the Arnold Park property where it stands.  With a height of  , a crown spread of   and a circumference of  , the resulting score of 402 is higher than for any other white oak in Maryland.  The Wilmer Stone White Oak now stands as the Maryland Champion of its species. As such, it is now eligible to become the official State Tree. A portion of the oak was destroyed in 1988, making it jut out to the side in a broken Y formation, or it would have surpassed the National Champion in Virginia, a 427 pointer.  The honored tree stands proudly in the silent Arnold forest, broken only by the calls of ospreys, wrens,  blue jays and cardinals. Deer and fox also populate the woodlands, darting among the black locust trees, wild grape vines and Virginia creeper. Tall Trees of Chase Creek Woods.

HistoryThe area that was to become Cape St. Claire was mostly farmland until the 1940s. In the late 18th century, much of the land was operated as farmland by a couple of families. Two houses from this era remain—the "Stinchcomb House" located near the Cape St. Claire clubhouse, and Goshen Farm, located on a hill near the Cape St. Claire Elementary School.In the early part of the 20th Century, Hugh H. Young, a prominent doctor on the staff of Johns Hopkins University, began buying up the farmland with the intention of building a community. Dr. Young's first attempt, a community called Persimmon Point, was less than successful with only a few lots being sold. This failure was brought on by the Great Depression and the project was put on hold. Upon Dr. Young's death, his children created the River Bay Company to manage the property for development.The River Bay Company platted the community of Cape St. Claire (incorporating Persimmon Point property as part of the new community) on June 14, 1949. The community was envisioned and sold as a summer retreat for residents of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. To manage the affairs of the new community, the River Bay Company created and incorporated the Cape St. Claire Club, governed by a Board of Governors. The first meeting of the Board of Governors of the Cape St. Claire Club (renamed the Cape St. Claire Improvement Association on May 12, 1959) was held on June 30, 1949. The Board consisted of three representatives of the River Bay Company named in the Cape St. Claire Club certificate of incorporation: John G. Rouse, Jr.; James C. Morton, Jr.; and George W. Baker, Jr. Mr. James C. Morton was elected Chairman.In April 1989, the Anne Arundel County Council approved the formation of the Cape St. Claire Special Community Benefits District.  The SCBD allows the community to establish a taxing district. The taxes are collected by the county government (as part of the property tax), which are then turned over to the Improvement Association to administer as voted on by the property owners in the community. This special benefits district has allowed the community to purchase additional common property, build a specially-designated fishing/crabbing pier, make improvements to community assets, and hire off-duty county police for additional security. OrganizationsIn addition to the Cape St. Claire Improvement Association there are many social and service organizations in the community.

"The community has recently gained the legal ability to change this part of the covenant, and is now undertaking procedures to have these restrictions, which the community members find offensive, removed.

Crofton, Maryland     Crofton is a census-designated place and planned community in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States.  Crofton is located   south of Baltimore,   west of Annapolis, and   east-northeast of Washington, D.C. . Established in 1964, Crofton held its 40th birthday celebration in 2004.  In July 2007 Crofton was named by Money magazine as one of "100 Best Places to Live" in the United States. Crofton placed 72nd out of 100 cities on the list. It was selected for its relative anonymity while still boasting many major amenities, excellent schools, and sought after location.   Crofton was selected again for the magazine's 2011 list, this time placing 82nd.    Community life frequently revolves around Crofton Parkway,   actually a scenic loop   long, tangentially touching the larger "triangle" made up of three nearby roads, which encloses the original Crofton community. Crofton Parkway is the scene of yearly parades, two of the community's five elementary schools, the Town Hall, Village Green, community events, Crofton Country Club, and walkers, joggers and bikers around the loop. The Crofton area now extends North from the triangle, including Crofton Park. Crofton also has a community pool, the Crofton Swim and Tennis Club [CSTC] but is restricted to those inhabitants of the triangle. In 1963, after the Crawford Corporation accumulated over   of land, it announced that it would build a new community called Crofton. This new town and planned community was founded at the same time as Reston, Virginia (April 17, 1964) and Columbia, Maryland (1967). Crofton would be anchored by a community golf course, which later became the Crofton Country Club. Crofton was officially founded in the fall of 1964. The company considered picking an English name for the new town that "sounds well and implies that this is a pleasant place to live." It ended up picking the name "Crofton," named after a small township in Cumberland County, England. The English town was originally called Croft-town, derived from the word Croft, as the town standing upon the Crofts. Originally an exclusive gated community, Crofton's gates were opened and they now only serve as a symbol for this community just off Route 3.

Crofton pond snakehead fish incident   Crofton was in the national news in late June and early July 2002 after a Northern Snakehead fish was discovered in a pond behind the Crofton post office (not the local landmark Lake Louise, but instead across Route 3 from it).The snakehead species, which is highly aggressive, voracious, and can walk short distances on land, came from a live Asian food market, where the fish is a delicacy. In order to ensure that the fish were eliminated, the pond was dosed heavily with rotenone, and subsequently with potassium permanganate (September 17, 2002). Six adult snakeheads and more than one thousand juvenile fish were found and destroyed. Ultimately, the incident initiated a national discussion on invasive species and comparisons with the mute swan, also an invasive and destructive species of the Chesapeake Bay watershed but, in comparison, quite beautiful, and which garnered support from some environmental and animal rights groups.There have been several movies inspired by this incident. Syfy has aired two movies in relation to the snakehead outbreak. In March 2004, a movie called Snakehead Terror was featured, and in June 2004, the movie Frankenfish was aired. There has also been a movie produced by Ten Pound Films titled Swarm of the Snakehead which related to this incident.In 2007, a documentary on the National Geographic Channel titled Fishzilla: Snakehead Invasion aired that discussed the ecological damage that the snakeheads found in Crofton have done to surrounding areas.

Glen Burnie, Maryland     Glen Burnie is a census-designated place (CDP) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. The population was 67,639 at the 2010 census. A Maryland District court building is located here. HistoryIn 1812, Elias Glenn, a district attorney, established a county seat near what is currently known as Brooklyn Park. He named his property "Glennsburne". The name was changed to "Glennsbourne Farm", and eventually "Glenburnie", as the property was passed through Glenn's descendants. Records also show the name as "Tracey's Station" and "Myrtle", after local postmaster Samuel Sewell Tracey and one of Tracey's boarders, before the final decision was made. In 1854, William Wilkins Glenn, Elias Glenn's grandson, incorporated the Curtis Creek Mining, Furnace and Manufacturing Company into his family's property.  The business flourished during the 19th century, and with it came several thousand acres of land in northern Anne Arundel County. Upon the death of William Wilkins Glenn, his son, brother and nephew began to manage the family's business affairs, and Glenburnie became an official state subdivision in 1888  . The Glenn family contracted George T. Melvin and Henry S. Mancha to lay out and promote the town. It would not be until 1930 that postmaster Louis J. DeAlba decided two words were better than one, and gave the town a final name change to the current Glen Burnie.  BuildingsAmong the earliest Glen Burnie schools was First Avenue Elementary, built in 1899. The oldest area church is St. Alban's Episcopal, which was built in 1904, with many of its bricks dating back to Marley Chapel, an early Maryland parish from the 1730s. Crain Highway, one of Glen Burnie's main thoroughfares (named after State Senator Robert Crain), opened in 1927 and Ritchie Highway (Maryland Route 2, named for ex-Governor Albert C. Ritchie) followed in 1939.  Ritchie Highway carried nearly all Baltimore-area traffic headed for Annapolis and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge until an alternate bypass road, Interstate 97, opened in the 1980s. [Prior to the 1980s,] Until 1950 the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad provided both passenger and freight service from Annapolis to Baltimore; passenger service ended in February 1950 due to increased competition from buses and private automobiles, but freight service continued until Hurricane Agnes did so much damage to a trestle crossing the Severn River in Annapolis that the trestle was condemned for use by trains by the Army Corps of Engineers in the late 1960s (The trestle remained as a haven for fishermen and crabbers until it was dismantled). [it was served by the now-defunct Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad's line between Baltimore and Annapolis, Maryland]. North Glen Burnie is now served by the Baltimore Light Rail system's Cromwell/Glen Burnie station.Schools and churches were built in the ensuing decades, and construction was completed on Harundale Mall, the first enclosed shopping center east of the Mississippi River, in 1958.  It was one of the first shopping centers to be called a "mall" and was developed by James W. Rouse of the Rouse Company (which also developed nearby Columbia, Maryland). The mall was developed in a joint effort with a local Real Estate developer, Charles Steffey.  The original planned location was not on Ritchie Highway but on Crain Highway (the main arterial for Glen Burnie).  Charlie Steffey and Jim Rouse negotiated unsuccessfully with the "city fathers" of Glen Burnie, offering to regenerate the (then failing) center of town with their revolutionary concept.  The "sticking point" was that the intersection of Crain Highway and Quarterfield road (the proposed location) habitually flooded in even nominal rainstorms, to the point of cars being up to their doors in the river that ensued. The "city fathers" decided that the advantage of having the "mall" there was overshadowed by the cost of fixing the storm water situation and declined.  As a result Glen Burnie Mall followed in 1962 . Marley Station Mall, another large shopping center, opened in February 1987 . The Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration office building employs many people in town. In the 1970s developers tried to make Glen Burnie more urban by building and funding new projects, projects like Empire Towers in 1974, or Crain Towers in 1990, then with the addition of a Anne Arundel Community College branch in the town center. In 1965 North Arundel Hospital opened as a community hospital , but seeing as it was constantly overflowed with patients, the University of Maryland Medical System bought the hospital in 2000  and renovated it to accommodate more patents and equipment.

Highland Beach, Maryland     Highland Beach is a town in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. The population was 96 at the 2010 census. The town was founded early in the 20th Century by affluent African Americans from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, looking for a retreat on the Chesapeake Bay. The town's incorporated status gave it a unique standing in empowering it to maintain its own police force. Celebrities with homes here have included Alex Haley, Bill Cosby, and Arthur Ashe. Streets there include Crummell, Dunbar, Henson, Augusta, Douglass, Langston, and Washington, named for the famous African-Americans. History Highland Beach was founded in the summer of 1893 by Charles Douglass (Frederick Douglass' son) and his wife Laura after they had been turned away from a restaurant at the nearby Bay Ridge resort because of their race [citation needed]. They bought a   tract on the Chesapeake Bay with   of beachfront and turned it into a summer enclave for their family and friends.  Their home, the Douglass Summer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.     It became a gathering place for upper-class blacks, including many of the well known personages of the age.Among the residents and guests were Paul Robeson, D.C. municipal court judge Robert Terrell and his wife Dr. Mary Church Terrell, Robert Weaver, Harriet Tubman, W. E. B. Du Bois, and poets Langston Hughes and Paul Laurence Dunbar. Charles Douglass’ father, the famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass, visited and would have become a resident had he not died before the house that his son was building for him was completed. When Highland Beach was incorporated in 1922 it became the first African-American municipality in Maryland. Although founded as a summer resort, it is now a town of year-round residents who choose not to permit commercial establishments. There are some sixty homes, many of them still owned and occupied by descendents of the original settlers. The residents are proud and protective of their town’s heritage, established over a century ago by people determined to overcome the prejudices of their post-Reconstruction times. However, as of the 2000 census, African-Americans make up less than 40 percent of the town's residents.The history of Highland Beach is recounted in the book, The Land Was Ours: African American Beaches from Jim Crow to the Sunbelt South, by Andrew W.

These two communities, split by the Baltimore Beltway in 1957, are Linthicum and North Linthicum (or, alternatively, Linthicum-Shipley and North Linthicum.)  Both communities developed as a result of their locations adjacent to the Baltimore and Annapolis Short Line railroad which brought commuters to the original truck farming community.As a developed community, Linthicum began with the 1908 founding of the "Linthicum Heights Company", though a "Linthicum" or "Linthicum's" station on the 1887 Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line railroad existed at least as early as 1889.  The community's name was from the area's primary land-owning family since an 1801 purchase by Abner Linthicum.

The town is named after former Governor of Maryland, Oden Bowie. It is bordered by Gambrills to the east, Severn to the north, Fort Meade to the west, and Crofton to the south. It is located at the intersection of Maryland routes 170 and 175 and is parallel to Route 32. The zipcode is 21113.  History and railroadIn 1840, the steam-powered Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad (A&ER) was built across a sparsely settled farming community that would later become Odenton.  At the beginning of the Civil War, Union soldiers guarded this railroad line because it was the only link between the North and the nation's capital.  Rail traffic through Baltimore had been disrupted by southern sympathizers, so supplies, mail and soldiers flowed through Annapolis and west Anne Arundel County to Washington.The town of Odenton, nicknamed "The Town a Railroad Built" by Catherine L. O'Malley,  was formed in 1868 with the construction of the Baltimore Potomac (B&P) Railroad connecting Baltimore and Washington, D. C.  Where the B&P crossed the A&ER, a train station and telegraph office were constructed and named for Oden Bowie, President of the B&P and former governor of Maryland.  Train service to the station began on July 2, 1872.  The rail junction (today's MARC station) at Odenton Road, already a busy thoroughfare from Annapolis to Frederick, became the site of Odenton's first commercial center.  The Watts and Murray general stores served railroad workers and farmers, and in 1871 a post office was established.  A town grew near the junction, houses were built for railroad workers, a Methodist church was dedicated in 1891 and a grade school opened in 1892. Small villages developed around these various railroad lines, but none amounted to more than a cluster of shops and homes around a train station and post office. The 1878 Maryland Directory listed the following towns: Conaway, Odenton, Patuxent, Sappington, and Woodwardville. Odenton was the largest with a population  of 100 with a church, a school and two stores.  In nearby Woodwardville, where the B&P crossed the Little Patuxent River, A. G. Woodward was the postmaster and operated a general merchandise store in a village of 50 people.  Two churches and a school served that community.  Land was worth from $5 and $30 per acre, producing wheat, corn and tobacco.Canneries, primarily for tomatoes, were built in many locations in Anne Arundel County, including Odenton and Woodwardville.  The George M. Murray Canning House, built in the late 19th century on Odenton Road (behind present day 1380 and 1382 Odenton Road) was a successful operation into the early 1900s.Shortly after 1900, another company built an electric interurban railroad parallel to the B&P and also electrified the former A&ER.  Train service on these lines began in 1908.  The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad provided public transportation to central Maryland.In 1914, the United States Naval Academy purchased the   Hammond Manor Farm for the construction of a dairy following the 1910 typhoid fever outbreak at the Academy.  The Academy operated the dairy until 1998. Until 2005 it was the home of Dean Foods' Horizon Organic dairy. The farm is currently the home of Maryland Sunrise Farm.In 1917, at the advent of World War I, Odenton’s growth was spurred by the establishment of Fort Meade. The United States Department of War acquired   of land west of Odenton to develop a training camp, displacing numerous farmers, merchants and public and private enterprises, many of whom moved east to nearby Odenton.  The Epiphany Chapel and Church House at Fort Meade was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.    This growth accelerated in the 1950s with the establishment of the National Security Agency on the fort and Friendship International Airport (now the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport) a few miles to the north.  Odenton still maintains its railroad history through the Dennis F. Sullivan Maintenance Facility, operated by Amtrak, which maintains track, bridges and other structures on the Amtrak/MARC line between Baltimore and Washington.  All of this, as well as the suburban expansion of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., have transformed Odenton from a farmland region to a business, residential and industrial center in Anne Arundel County.

Bowleys Quarters, Maryland   Bowleys Quarters is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, with a population of 6,755 at the 2010 census.    HistoryBowleys Quarters was named for Daniel Bowley, a merchant and sea captain who owned some   around Baltimore in the mid-18th century. Bowleys Quarters was used to house his slaves. The area later became a game preserve for waterfowl and a place where presidents and others, including Babe Ruth, came to hunt ducks. The area eventually became known as a vacation spot, and many summer homes were built along the water. Many blue-collar workers were attracted during the industrial boom of the 1920s through the 1950s. Many worked at the nearby Glenn L. Martin company (now Lockheed Martin) and Bethlehem Steel. The community experienced an economic downturn with downsizing of the Martin facility and other area businesses, and Bowleys Quarters became a mix of middle-class homes juxtaposed with modern waterfront homes. Increased interest in waterfront property in the 1990s, combined with the devastation of Hurricane Isabel, has led to revitalization, with some new homes selling for more than $1 million. Once predominantly populated by low-income to middle-class families, the community is now highly desirable for waterfront living.In September 2003, Bowleys Quarters was substantially damaged by Hurricane Isabel and the resulting flood. According to The Baltimore Sun, Isabel destroyed 210 houses in Bowleys Quarters and caused major damage to 632 others.  GeographyBowleys Quarters is located at  .

HistoryIn 1880, Thomas Carney immigrated to the United States from Ireland and settled in Texas, Maryland. Soon after his arrival, he married the former Mary McDermot and bought forty and a half acres on the southeast side of the Baltimore and Harford Turnpike.Several years later (about 1885), the Carney family moved to what is now Harford and Joppa roads, where Thomas Carney opened a general store which is believed to have served as the Eight Mile House on the turnpike.  The store was located on the site presently occupied by the Barn Restaurant.  In the 1880s and 1890s the store also served as the Carney family home.When the family grew too large for the store, Mr. Carney built a new house on the hill behind the store. The house was completed in about 1898 and stood in the vicinity of what is now Thornewood Court. Thirty-five years later, the Carney house was moved to its present location at the corner of Joppa and Avondale roads and is now a real estate office.With the passage of time and the suburban growth of Baltimore County, the land once owned by the Carney family has been sold to individuals and developers. However, the Carney family name is now carried by area businesses and clubs. Two institutions, the Carney Library and the Carney Elementary School, also carry the name. Little did Thomas Carney, an industrious Irish immigrant, realize that his memory would live on by a community which bears his name. EducationCarney is served by Carney Elementary School and Harford Hills Elementary School, Pine Grove Middle School, Loch Raven High School, and Parkville High School.

Catonsville, Maryland   Catonsville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 41,567 at the 2010 census.    The community lies to the west of Baltimore along the city's border. Catonsville is the home of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), a public research university with over 12,000 students. HistoryEuropeans were the second group to settle the area now known as Catonsville. It is generally believed by historians that native tribes, known as the Piscataway, established villages here before the European colonists arrived. This tribe occupied the land between the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay and up the Patapsco River. Catonsville was located along the Piscataway Trail. The colonists and the tribes got along until the mid-17th century, when the English government ended the practices of Catholic missionaries in the area. It is believed that the tribes were driven from their villages and some were hunted by slave catchers. As happened in many areas of early colonial America, diseases unknown to the tribes were spread by the colonists. Eventually, the tribes moved north under the protection of the Iroquois.With most of the natives scattered, the colonists expanded across Maryland. Present-day Catonsville was settled in the 18th century. In the early 19th century, a county road along the Patapsco River—named the Frederick Turnpike, later designated Route 144—was opened by the Ellicott family to serve traffic between their flour mill, Ellicott Mills, and Baltimore. Catonsville as we know it today was settled along this route by Richard Caton, under the authority of his father-in-law Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Travelers along "the turnpike" (as it was then known) rested and conducted business in the area, causing Catonsville to grow.The large Victorian and Colonial homes located in Catonsville were built by wealthy Baltimoreans. Originally, these communities were used as summer residences to escape the heat in Baltimore. Eventually, as in many communities with the introduction of the automobile and electric trolley, families began to reside in Catonsville year round.  Baltimore attempted over the years to annex Catonsville, the last attempt in 1918, but all attempts were rebuffed. The community remains an unincorporated town in Baltimore County. It is home to Spring Grove Hospital Center, the nation's second oldest continuously operating psychiatric hospital.Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) made his last public appearance on June 9, 1909, at the commencement ceremony of St. Timothy's School for Girls in Catonsville, to fulfill a promise he made to a young girl he had met on the steamer Minnehaha in 1907.Catonsville was briefly made quite famous during the 1968 protest by the "Catonsville Nine", during which draft records were burned by Catholic anti-war activists.In 2002, the Maryland legislature issued a proclamation declaring Catonsville to be "Music City, Maryland", because of the concentration of musical retail stores, venues and educational facilities in the area.In 2007 Money magazine ranked Catonsville the 49th best place to live in the USA, third best in Maryland and Virginia.

Cockeysville, Maryland   Cockeysville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 20,776 at the 2010 census.    HistoryCockeysville was named after the Cockey family who helped establish the town. Thomas Cockey (1676–1737) settled in Limestone Valley in 1725 at Taylor's Hall (an area now just north of Padonia Road and east of Interstate 83). Joshua Frederick Cockey (1765–1821) built one of the first homes in the area in 1798 and built the first commercial structure, a hotel, in 1810 in what would become the village of Cockeysville. His son, Judge Joshua F. Cockey (1800–1891), was a lifelong resident in the village and built the train station (what would be part of the Pennsylvania Railroad) and accompanying commercial buildings in the 1830s.Cockeysville was the scene of some Civil War activity. Confederate soldiers pushed into the Baltimore area, intending to cut off the city and Washington from the north. On July 10, 1864, Confederate cavalry under General Bradley T. Johnson entered Cockeysville, destroying telegraph lines and track along the Northern Central Railway. They also burned the first bridge over the Gunpowder Falls, just beyond nearby Ashland.After the war, Joshua F. Cockey III (1837–1920) founded the National Bank of Cockeysville (1891) and other commercial ventures in the community, as well as developing dwellings along the York Turnpike (now York Road) that made up the village of Cockeysville.Stone Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.    Baltimore County School No. 7 was listed in 2000.  Local institutionsCockeysville is home to the Baltimore County Public Library: Cockeysville Branch. Schools  Padonia International Elementary Warren Elementary School Cockeysville Middle School Dulaney High School (in neighboring Timonium)   Grand Lodge  The Grand Lodge of Maryland, Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons,  is located in Cockeysville on a   campus. It includes a castle-like structure known as Bonnie Blink ("Beautiful View" in Scottish), which is the retirement home for Master Masons, Eastern Star ladies and eligible family members. Located throughout the Grand Lodge are detailed, hand-laid tile storyboards depicting Masonic themes.  Adjacent to the Grand Lodge building is the Freemason's Hall, containing the Maryland Grand Lodge Museum. The museum has the desk that George Washington resigned his commission on, prior to becoming President, a rare Latin Bible from 1482, and some jewels and regalia of Maryland's past Grand Masters. Commerce and industryA quarry, dating back to the 19th century, produces limestone and marble, including some of the marble used in the construction of the Washington Monument.  The whiter portion towards the bottom half of the monument originated from this quarry, but since construction was halted when money ran low, the monument had to be finished using a cheaper, different-colored stone.Phase one (1848 to 1858) of construction continued up to the   level, under the direction of Superintendent William Daugherty.  The exterior featured white marble from Texas, Maryland, as well as four rows of it from Sheffield, Massachusetts.  In phase two (1878 to 1888), with work completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, commanded by Lt. Col. Thomas L. Casey, white marble for the exterior was used from a different Cockeysville quarry.The local marble was also used in 1836 to form the track bed of the Padonia Road section of the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad (which later became part of the Northern Central Railway); the use of marble instead of wood was an experiment that was soon after abandoned.  GeographyCockeysville is located at   (39.473273, -76.626703),  north of the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695) along Interstate 83 and York Road.

Dundalk, Maryland            Dundalk is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 63,597 at the 2010 census.    In 1960 and 1970, Dundalk was the largest unincorporated community in Maryland. It was named after the town of Dundalk, Ireland.  Dundalk is considered one of the first inner-ring suburbs of Baltimore. HistoryThe area now known as Dundalk was first explored by John Smith in 1608, when while conducting an expedition up the Chesapeake Bay he landed on the area known as the Patapsco Neck. Up until this time, the area was occupied by the tribes of the Susquehannock Indians.In 1664 Thomas Todd of Virginia purchased   of land on the Patapsco Neck, this being the first deed in Baltimore County. The original house, "Todd's Inheritance", was burned by the British during the War of 1812 Battle of North Point. After the war the house was rebuilt, and it still stands today as a historical landmark.In 1856 Henry McShane, an immigrant from Ireland, established the McShane Bell Foundry on the banks of the Patapsco River in the then far southeastern outskirts of Baltimore.  The foundry later relocated to the Patterson Park area of Baltimore until a fire during the 1940s caused it to move to 201 East Federal Street. In addition to bronze bells, the foundry once manufactured cast iron pipes and furnace fittings. When asked by the Baltimore and Sparrows Point Railroad for a name of a depot for the foundry, which was on their rail line, McShane wrote Dundalk, after the town of his birth, Dundalk, Ireland. In 1977 the foundry moved to its current location in Glen Burnie. In 1916 the Bethlehem Steel Company purchased   of farmland, near the McShane foundry, to develop housing for its shipyard workers. The Dundalk Company was formed to plan a town in the new style, similar to that of the Roland Park area of Baltimore, excluding businesses except at specific spots and leaving land for future development of schools, playing fields, and parks. By 1917 Dundalk proper was founded, at which point it had 62 houses, two stores, a post office, and a telephone exchange.  Streets were laid out in a pedestrian-friendly open grid, with monikers like "Shipway", "Northship", "Flagship", and "Admiral".  The two-story houses had steeply pitched roofs and stucco exteriors.The Dundalk Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Sandy Spring, Maryland       Sandy Spring, Maryland is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Maryland. The community was founded by Quakers who arrived in the early 18th century searching for land where they could grow tobacco and corn. One of the very early land owners in the Sandy Spring area was Richard Snowden, who patented (purchased) the   "Snowden's Manor" in 1715. Snowden gradually enlarged his property with additional land purchases over the next few decades until it was surveyed at over   as "Snowden's Manor Enlarged" in 1743. Another important early landowner, Major John Bradford, had patented over   in the Sandy Spring area by 1720, including "Charley Forest", "Charley Forest Enlarged", "Higham", and "Discovery." Bradford sold off large parts of these properties, but Snowden's son-in-law, James Brooke, later bought up the original Charley Forest land as well as other land in the area, eventually owning over   by the 1760s.  The Quakers built their meeting house in 1817 near a fresh-water spring which gave its name to the community.  In the late 19th century the community started a local school called the Sherwood Academy. This school was turned over to the Montgomery County  Government in 1906 to become Sherwood High School, that county's third public high school. A Quaker school, Sandy Spring Friends School, was established in 1961.The United States Census Bureau combines Sandy Spring with the nearby community of Ashton to form the census-designated place of Ashton-Sandy Spring, and all census data are tabulated for this combined entity.

Chevy Chase is home to the National 4-H Center, where the National Science Bowl is held in late April or early May.Chevy Chase is served by the Montgomery County Public Schools. History Chevy Chase was unincorporated farmland in the years before 1890, during which time Senator Francis G. Newlands of Nevada and his partners began the aggressive acquisition of land in northwestern Washington, D.C., and southern Montgomery County, Maryland, for the purpose of developing a residential streetcar suburb for Washington, DC. (See Washington streetcars.)  The Chevy Chase Land Company was founded in 1890, and its eventual holdings of more than   would extend along the present-day Connecticut Avenue from Florida Avenue north to Jones Bridge Road.  The Chevy Chase Land Company would build houses for no less than $5,000 on Connecticut Avenue or less than $3,000 on a side street.  The name "Chevy Chase" was taken from one of the absorbed plots of land. Its name in turn, according to the Village of Chevy Chase's official history, can be traced to the larger tract of land called "Cheivy Chace" that was patented to Colonel Joseph Belt from Lord Baltimore on July 10, 1725. It has historic associations to a 1388 battle between Lord Percy of England and Earl Douglas of Scotland. At issue in this "chevauchée" (a French word describing a border raid) were hunting grounds or a "chace" in the Cheviot Hills of Northumberland and Otterburn. Like many suburban towns throughout the United States during the first half of the 20th century, Chevy Chase excluded individuals based on race and religion.  Founder Francis G. Newlands was an "avowed racist" Fisher, Marc.  "Chevy Chase, 1916: For Everyman, a New Lot in Life,"  Washington Post, February 15, 1999  who in 1912 mounted his presidential campaign on a platform that called for a constitutional amendment to disenfranchise black men and limit immigration to whites only. Three years earlier, the Chevy Chase Land Company had brought suit against a developer who had begun to sell lots to black people in a planned subdivision called "Belmont" on the grounds that the developer had committed fraud by proposing "to sell lots...to negroes." By the 1920s, exclusionary language had begun to appear in Chevy Chase real estate deeds.  Some prohibited both the sale or rental of homes to "a Negro or one of the African race."   Others prohibited sales or rentals to "any persons of the Semetic (sic) race."  By World War II, such restrictive language had largely disappeared from real estate transactions, and all were voided by the Supreme Court's 1948 decision in Shelley v. Kraemer.

Germantown, Maryland  For other places with the same name, see Germantown, Maryland (disambiguation).      Germantown is an urbanized census-designated place in Montgomery County, Maryland. With a population of 86,395 as of the 2010 United States Census, Germantown is the third most populous place in Maryland, after the city of Baltimore, and the census-designated place of Columbia, Maryland. If Germantown were to incorporate as a city, it would become the second largest incorporated city in Maryland, after Baltimore.   Germantown is located approximately   outside of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C., and is an important part of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. The original plan for Germantown divided the area into a downtown and six town villages,  namely Gunners Lake Village, Kingsview Village,  Churchill Village, Middlebrook Village,  Clopper's Mill Village, and Neelsville Village.  The Churchill Town Sector at the corner of Maryland Route 118 and Middlebrook Road most closely resembles the downtown, or center, of Germantown, due to the location of the Upcounty Regional Services Center, the Germantown Public Library, the Black Rock Arts Center, the Regal Germantown Stadium 14, and a pedestrian shopping that features an array of restaurants. Three exits to Interstate 270 are less than one mile away, the Maryland Area Regional Commuter train is within walking distance, and the Germantown Transit Center that provides Ride On shuttle service to the Shady Grove station of the Washington Metro's Red Line.Germantown has the assigned ZIP codes of 20874 and 20876 for delivery and 20875 for post office boxes. It is the most populous Germantown in Maryland and is the only "Germantown, Maryland" recognized by the United States Postal Service, even though there is one in Anne Arundel County, one in Baltimore County, and one in Worcester County.  EtymologyIn the 1830s and 1840s, the central business area was focused around the intersection of Liberty Mill Road and Clopper Road. Many of the business owners spoke with what appeared to be a German accent. Despite the fact that most of the local landowners and farmers were of British ancestry, travelers remembering the apparent German accents of the shop-owners dubbed the area "German town", and the name stuck.  History 19th century Early educationGermantown did not have a public school until after the end of the American Civil War. During that time, education was handled at homes. In 1868, a one-room schoolhouse was built on Maryland Route 118, near Black Rock Road, which hosted children from both Germantown and neighboring Darnestown. In 1883, a larger one-room schoolhouse was built closer to Clopper Road. Another, newer school was constructed in 1910, on what is now the site of Germantown Elementary School. This school had four rooms, with two downstairs and two upstairs, with each room housing two grade levels. After the eighth grade, the students would head via train to nearby Rockville, for further education.  American Civil WarAlthough it avoided much of the physical destruction that ravaged other cities in the region, the American Civil War was still a cause of resentment and division among residents of Germantown. Many Germantown residents, particularly those of German ancestry, were against slavery and had sons fighting for the Union Army. In contrast, other residents of Germantown, particularly those of English ancestry, owned slaves, and even those who weren't slave-owners had sons fighting for the Confederate Army. As a result, many people in Germantown, who were once on friendly terms with each other, made an effort not to interact with each other, such as switching churches, or frequenting a store or mill miles away form the ones they'd normally do business with.  Late in the summer and fall of 1861, there were more than twenty thousand Union Army soldiers camped to the west of Germantown, in neighboring Darnestown and Poolesville. Occasionally, these soldiers would come to Germantown and frequent the stores there. In September of 1862, and in June of 1863, several regiments of Union Army soldiers marched north on Maryland Route 355, on their way to the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Gettysburg, respectively. In July of 1864, General Jubal Early led his army of Confederate soldiers down Maryland Route 355 to attack the Union capital of Washington, D.C. Throughout the course of the war, Confederate raiders would often come through the Germantown area. Local farmers in the Germantown area lost horses and other livestock to both Union and Confederate armies.   Assassination of Abraham LincolnOn April 20, 1865, George Atzerodt, a co-conspirator in the Abraham Lincoln assassination, was captured in Germantown. He was assigned by John Wilkes Booth to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, but lost his nerve and fled Washington, D.C., on the night of the Lincoln assassination. He was captured at his cousin Hartman Richter's farm in Germantown. Atzerodt was hanged on July 7, 1865 along with Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, and David Herold in Washington, D.C.   1910s The Liberty MillThe wooden structure of the Bowman Brothers Mill fell victim to a fire in 1914, but four years later, the owners were back in business again, selling the mill to the Liberty Milling Company, a brand new corporation. Augustus Selby was the first owner and manager of the new Liberty Mill, which opened in 1918. Electricity was brought into Liberty Mill and also served the homes and businesses nearby, making Germantown the first area in the northern portion of Montgomery County to receive electricity.  1930sIn 1935, professional baseball player Walter Perry Johnson, who played as a pitcher for the Washington Senators, purchased a farm on what is now the site of Seneca Valley High School. Used as a dairy farm, Johnson lived there with his five children and his mother, as his wife died, until his death in 1946.    1940s"Feed the Liberty Way" was used as a slogan for Liberty Mill which, with eight silos, became the second largest mill in all of Maryland, supplying flour to the United States Army during World War II. Cornmeal and animal feed were also manufactured at Liberty Mill, and a store at the mill sold specialty mixes, such as pancake and muffin mix.  1950s U.S. Atomic Energy CommissionIn January 1958, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was relocated from its location in downtown Washington, D.C. to Germantown, which was considered far enough from the city to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack.  The facility now operates as an administration complex for the U.S. Department of Energy and headquarters for its Office of Biological and Environmental Research. During the 1970s, Wernher von Braun, a German rocket scientist during World War II, worked for the aerospace company Fairchild Industries, which had offices in Germantown, as its Vice President for Engineering and Development. Von Braun worked at Fairchild Industries from July 1, 1972 until his death. 1960s Early development and Master PlanMarshall Davis owned a farm located where Interstate 270 and Germantown Road intersect today.    After Interstate 270 divided his farm in two, Davis decided to sell the last of his land to the International Development Corporation for about $1,300 per acre in 1955.  Fairchild-Hiller Corporation bought the land for about $4,000 per acre in 1964, and it built an industrial park on the land four years later.  Harry Unglesee and his family sold their farm near Hoyles Mill Road for less than $1,000 per acre in 1959.  Other farmers soon sold their land to developers and speculators as well.  The Germantown Master Plan was adopted in 1967.    The plan for the   area included a dense central downtown area and less dense development surrounding it.    In 1974, the Montgomery County Council approved an amended plan written by the Montgomery County Planning Board.  The amended plan included a downtown area and six separate villages, each comprising smaller neighborhoods with schools, shopping areas, and public facilities.  The amended plan also included the construction of a third campus for Montgomery College near the downtown area.  1970sFollowing the end of World War II, the Liberty Mill went into disrepair, and was finally destroyed by an arsonist in 1971.  In 1974, the completion of a sewer line helped the development and growth of Germantown.     Montgomery CollegeThe Germantown Campus of Montgomery College opened on October 21, 1978. At the time, it consisted of two buildings, 24 employees, and 1,200 students. Enrollment had increased to five thousand students by 2003, with eighty employees across four buildings. A steel water tower modeled after the Earth can be seen from orbiting satellites in outer space. As of 2008, a forty-acre bio-technology laboratory was nearing completion.  1980s Economic growthSince the early 1980s, Germantown has experienced rapid economic and population growth, both in townhouses and single-family dwellings, and an urbanized town center has been built. Germantown was the fastest growing zip code in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area and Maryland in 1986.  2000sIn 2000, the Upcounty Regional Services Center opened in Germantown, and a 16,000 square feet section of the first floor was home to the Germantown Public Library for several years.   In March 2001, Germantown's only movie theater, the Sony 6, located at the Germantown Commons Shopping Center, closed down, leaving Germantown without a movie theater of its own. Over a year later, in May 2002, the Hoyts Cinema 14, now the Regal Germantown Stadium 14, opened, and Germantown now had its own movie theater once again. A DSW footwear retail store now sits on the site of the former Sony 6 theater.  In 2007, at a cost of 19 million dollars, the Germantown Public Library moved from the Upcounty Regional Services Center to its current location, at a separate 44,193 square foot facility at the nearby Germantown Town Center.  2010sIn August 2011, a 7-Eleven convenience store in downtown Germantown fell victim to a flash mob robbery, in which nearly forty people walked into the store, grabbed merchandise, and subsequently fled with the stolen goods, all without paying. The incident garnered widespread attention in the United States and internationally.    Population boom In 2000, Germantown had a population of 55,419, according to the 2000 United States Census. Ten years later, at the time of the 2010 United States Census, Germantown had experienced a 55.9% growth in population, growing from 55,419 to 86,395. GovernmentThe United States Department of Energy has its headquarters for the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in Germantown. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was moved from its location in downtown Washington, D.C. to the present-day U.S. Department of Energy building in Germantown, due to fears of a Soviet nuclear attack on the U.S. capital. At the time, Germantown was believed to be far enough from Washington, D.C. to avoid the worst effects of a nuclear strike on the city. The facility now operates as an administration complex for the U.S. Department of Energy. Business and financeLibrary Systems & Services and Wabtec have their headquarters in Germantown.  Earth Networks, Inc. (formerly known as AWS Convergence Technologies)/WeatherBug,  Availink, Inc.,  DRT,  Hughes Network Systems, Qiagen, GE Aviation, and  Proxy Aviation Systems  all have offices in Germantown.

McCulloch v. Maryland       McCulloch v. Maryland,  , was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. The state of Maryland had attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the U.S. Bank. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution.This case established two important principles in constitutional law. First, the Constitution grants to Congress implied powers for implementing the Constitution's express powers, in order to create a functional national government. Second, state action may not impede valid constitutional exercises of power by the Federal government. Background On April 8, 1816, the Congress of the United States passed an act titled "An Act to Incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank of the United States" which provided for the incorporation of the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank first went into full operation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1817, the Bank opened a branch in Baltimore, Maryland, and transacted and carried on business as a branch of the Bank of the United States by issuing bank notes, discounting promissory notes, and performing other operations usual and customary for banks to do and perform. Both sides of the litigation admitted that the President, directors, and company of the Bank had no authority to establish the Baltimore branch, or office of discount and deposit, other than the fact that Maryland had adopted the Constitution of the United States.On February 11, 1818, the General Assembly of Maryland passed an act titled, "an act to impose a tax on all banks, or branches thereof, in the State of Maryland, not chartered by the legislature": Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland that if any bank has established or shall, without authority from the State first had and obtained establish any branch, office of discount and deposit, or office of pay and receipt in any part of this State, it shall not be lawful for the said branch, office of discount and deposit, or office of pay and receipt to issue notes, in any manner, of any other denomination than five, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, five hundred and one thousand dollars, and no note shall be issued except upon stamped paper of the following denominations; that is to say, every five dollar note shall be upon a stamp of ten cents; every ten dollar note, upon a stamp of twenty cents; every twenty dollar note, upon a stamp of thirty cents; every fifty dollar note, upon a stamp of fifty cents; every one hundred dollar note, upon a stamp of one dollar; every five hundred dollar note, upon a stamp of ten dollars; and every thousand dollar note, upon a stamp of twenty dollars; which paper shall be furnished by the Treasurer of the Western Shore, under the direction of the Governor and Council, to be paid for upon delivery; provided always that any institution of the above description may relieve itself from the operation of the provisions aforesaid by paying annually, in advance, to the Treasurer of the Western Shore, for the use of State, the sum of $15,000.  And be it enacted that the President, cashier, each of the directors and officers of every institution established or to be established as aforesaid, offending against the provisions aforesaid shall forfeit a sum of $500 for each and every offence, and every person having any agency in circulating any note aforesaid, not stamped as aforesaid directed, shall forfeit a sum not exceeding $100, every penalty aforesaid to be recovered by indictment or action of debt in the county court of the county where the offence shall be committed, one-half to the informer and the other half to the use of the State... James William McCulloch, head of the Baltimore Branch of the Second Bank of the United States, refused to pay the tax. The lawsuit was filed by John James, an informer who sought to collect one half of the fine as provided for by the statute. The case was appealed to the Maryland Court of Appeals where the state of Maryland argued that "the Constitution is silent on the subject of banks."  It was Maryland's contention that because the Constitution did not specifically state that the federal government was authorized to charter a bank, the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional.  The court upheld Maryland.  The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court decisionThe Court determined that Congress did have the power to create the Bank.  Chief Justice Marshall supported this conclusion with four main arguments.    First, he argued that historical practice established Congress' power to create the Bank. Marshall invoked the first Bank of the United States history as authority for the constitutionality of the second bank.  The first Congress enacted the bank after great debate and that it was approved by an executive "with as much preserving talent as any measure has ever experienced, and being supported by arguments which convinced minds as pure and as intelligent as this country can boast." Second, Chief Justice Marshall refuted the argument that states retain ultimate sovereignty because they ratified the constitution. "The powers of the general government, it has been said, are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion."  Marshall contended that it was the people who ratified the Constitution and thus the people are sovereign, not the states. Third, Marshall addressed the scope of congressional powers under Article I. The Court broadly described Congress' authority before addressing the necessary and proper clause.  Marshall admitted that the Constitution does not enumerate a power to create a central Bank but said that this is not dispositive as to Congress's power to establish such an institution.  Chief Justice Marshall wrote, "In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding." Fourth, Marshall supported the Court's opinion textually by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause, which permits Congress to seek an objective that is within its enumerated powers so long as it is rationally related to the objective and not forbidden by the Constitution.  In liberally interpreting the Necessary and Proper clause, the Court naturally rejected Maryland's narrow interpretation of the clause, which purported that the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause meant that Congress could only pass those laws which were absolutely essential in the execution of its enumerated powers.  The Court rejected this argument, on the grounds that many of the enumerated powers of Congress under the Constitution would be useless if only those laws deemed essential to a power's execution could be passed.  Marshall also noted that the Necessary and Proper Clause is listed within the powers of Congress, not the limitations.The Court held that for these reasons, the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause does not refer to the only way of doing something, but rather applies to various procedures for implementing all constitutionally established powers.  "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional."This principle had been established many years earlier by Alexander Hamilton:   Chief Justice Marshall also determined that Maryland may not tax the bank without violating the Constitution.  The Court voided the tax on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. The opinion stated that Congress has implied powers that need to be related to the text of the Constitution, but need not be enumerated within the text.  This case was a seminal moment in the formation of a balance between federalism, federal power, and states' powers. Chief Justice Marshall also explained in this case that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not require that all federal laws be necessary and proper and that federal laws that are enacted directly pursuant to one of the express, enumerated powers granted by the Constitution need not comply with the Necessary and Proper Clause, holding that the clause "purport[s] to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the government. It purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already granted." Later historyMcCulloch v. Maryland was cited in the first substantial constitutional case presented before the High Court of Australia in D'Emden v Pedder (1904), which dealt with similar issues in the Australian Federation. While recognizing American law as not binding on them, the Australian Court nevertheless determined that the McCulloch decision provided the best guideline for the relationship between the Commonwealth federal government, and the Australian States, owing in large part to strong similarities between the American and Australian constitutions.

Jessup, Maryland   Jessup (pronounced JESS-up) is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland and Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The population was 7,865 at the 2000 census. The center of population of Maryland is located in Jessup.  It was the location of Maryland House of Correction, which was one of the Maryland Department of Corrections prison complexes until it closed in 2007.  The prison is referred to several times in the NBC television series Homicide: Life on the Street and the HBO original series, The Wire. Even though the maximum security prison is now closed, the town still houses a major minimum security prison, Brockbridge Correctional Facility, for violent offenders who are not deemed a threat to society due to the nature of their crimes.  Due to its geographically central location in the state, Jessup is also home to the very large Maryland Food Center, which includes the Maryland Produce Market and the Maryland Seafood Market,  The Jessup stop on Camden Line of the MARC Train system provides commuter rail service, but does not see much use. GeographyJessup is located at   (39.138374, -76.774929).  According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.2 square miles (11.0 km 2 ).None of the area is covered with water. As of the 2010 census, the center of population for the State of Maryland is located on the grounds of the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup.   HistoryThe town began as Jessup's Cut, a post village in Howard County on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The name is generally attributed to Jonathan Jessup, a civil engineer who worked on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The name was shortened in 1863. Into the mid 20th century, the town was called Jessups, then was shortened to Jessup. Since the mid-19th century, the area has been home to various penal institutions.   Inmates today still refer to these jails as "the cut," probably unaware of the origin of the name.Among its notable residents was Arnold Elzey, a major general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War; he retired to a small farm near Jessup.

Mount Airy, Maryland   Mount Airy is a town in Carroll and Frederick counties in the U.S. state of Maryland. It is part of both the Washington Metropolitan Area and Baltimore Metropolitan Area. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 9,288.    GeographyAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of  , of which,   is land and   is water.    HistoryMt. Airy was established in 1830 and continued to develop throughout the decade, beginning with the construction of house settlements along Parr's Ridge. A man named Henry Bussard built the first of these houses. This town was known for its train station on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) at Parr's Ridge. The railroad ran from Baltimore to Frederick, cities to the east and west, respectively, of Mt. Airy. Following 1830, the town received its official name after the suggestion of "Mount Airy" from an Irish B&O worker who complained about his freezing ears on a windy work day.  Over the years, milling, canning and sewing industries initially helped support Mt. Airy's economy. The town's proximity to the National Road contributed to its growth. The National Road ran west from Baltimore to Illinois. By the 1890s, the town's growth had increased significantly and three new churches were built (one Episcopal and two Methodist), along with a very important bridge, still standing and known by residents as the Twin Arch, that helped with railroad transportation. Three great fires (1903, 1914, and 1925) caused setbacks in growth, but the town rebuilt every time. The Mount Airy Historic District that includes the railroad station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.   Currently, Mt. Airy is no longer economically dependent on the railroad, as citizens work a variety of different jobs. Many of its citizens work in Washington, DC or Baltimore; the town is a part of both of those cities' metropolitan areas. Mt. Airy hosts four annual events each year. These events include MayFest (formerly known as the Spring Fling) in May, Flag Day in June, FallFest (formerly known as Festival on the Ridge) in October, and Christmas in Olde Town in December. An all-volunteer staff of townspeople dedicates their time to work at each of these events.

The population was 222 at the 2010 census.  GeographyQueen Anne is located at   (38.919039, -75.952827).

The border between Talbot County and Queen Anne's County runs through the middle of town. HistoryAccording to the Maryland Municipal League:     In the 1850s, the area that is now the town of Queen Anne, was part of a 225-acre farm owned by Jacob Morgan. Initially, the town nucleus was nothing but a 1½-story dwelling, but in 1864 Mr. Morgan built a more substantial place—it was known locally as “the mansion house,” and the locale was known as Morganville.     At that time, the Pennsylvania Railroad had been laid as far south as Greensboro and, a little later, to Ridgely and Hillsboro and thence across Tuckahoe Creek. In 1878, the railroad purchased a site for a station across the creek in Queen Anne’s County, and, quite logically, named it Queen Anne when the station was finally put into service about 1882.

USS Maryland (ACR-8)      {Infobox ship image}}      The second USS Maryland (ACR-8), also referred to as "Armored Cruiser 8", and later renamed Frederick, was a United States Navy   armored cruiser.She was laid down on 7 October 1901 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, launched on 12 September 1903, sponsored by Miss Jennie Scott Waters; and commissioned on 18 April 1905, Captain R. R. Ingersoll in command. Service history Pre-World War IIn October 1905, following shakedown, Maryland joined the Atlantic Fleet for operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean, where she took part in the 1906 winter maneuvers off Cuba. The next summer, she conducted a training cruise for Massachusetts Naval Militiamen, and then readied for transfer to the Pacific. Departing Newport on 8 September 1906, she sailed – via San Francisco and Hawaii — for the Asiatic Station, where she remained until October 1907. She then returned to San Francisco and for the next decade she cruised throughout the Pacific, participating in survey missions to Alaska (1912 and 1913); carrying United States Secretary of State Knox to Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Meiji Tenno (September 1912); steaming off the Central American coast to aid, if necessary, Americans endangered by political turmoil in Mexico and Nicaragua (1913, 1914, and 1916); and making numerous training cruises to Hawaii and the South-Central Pacific. World War IWhen the United States Congress declared war on Imperial Germany on 6 April 1917, the armored cruiser, renamed Frederick---in order to free up her original name for use with the Colorado-class battleship  ---on 9 November 1916, was en route from Puget Sound to San Francisco. Taking on men and supplies at the latter port, she got underway for the Atlantic. From May 1917 – January 1918, she patrolled the southeastern Atlantic off the coast of South America. On 1 February, she was assigned to escort duty in the North Atlantic, and until the signing of the Armistice, she convoyed troopships east of the 37th meridian. By 20 November, she was attached to the Cruiser and Destroyer Force, and before mid-1919 had completed six round trips returning troops from France. Detached from that duty, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was briefly placed in reduced commission. Inter-war periodFrederick crossed the Atlantic again, carrying the US Olympic Team to Antwerp, Belgium, as she conducted a naval reservist training cruise in July 1920. At the end of that year, she returned to the Pacific Fleet. Serving as flagship of the Train, Pacific Fleet, for the next year, she conducted only one lengthy cruise, to South America in March 1921. Operations off the west coast took up the remainder of her active duty career, and on 14 February 1922 she decommissioned and entered the Reserve Fleet at Mare Island. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November 1929 and sold on 11 February 1930.In 1921, Frederick was used for several scenes in Harold Lloyd's first full-length film, the comedy A Sailor-Made Man. Camera (vol. 4, no. 29, p. 8) mentions a dinner party for the cast that was given by the officers of the ship. References     Alden, John D.

USS Maryland (BB-46)    {Infobox ship image}}      USS Maryland (BB-46), also known as "Old Mary" or "Fighting Mary" to her crewmates, was a   during World War II. She was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the seventh state. She was commissioned in 1920 and, serving as the flagship of the fleet, cruised to Australia, New Zealand and Brazil.She is most notable for her service in World War II. She was present on Battleship Row during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and was lightly damaged by Japanese bombs. Returning to duty in 1942, she saw service in the Pacific War, first supporting the rest of the fleet at the Battle of Midway, and then patrolling the Fiji Islands to guard against Japanese incursion. Next, she  went on the offensive, commencing shore bombardments in  the Battle of Tarawa and later in the Battle of Kwajalein. During the Battle of Saipan she took torpedo damage to her bow, necessitating repairs and refits. She then participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf where she was hit by a kamikaze. She took another kamikaze hit at the Battle of Okinawa, and was in for repairs at the end of WWII.After service in Operation Magic Carpet, she was decommissioned in 1947 and sold for scrap. She received seven battle stars for WWII service. Construction  Maryland was one of four dreadnought battleships of the Colorado class to be constructed. Her keel was laid down on 24 April 1917 by Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 20 March 1920, and sponsored by Mrs. E. Brook Lee daughter-in-law of U.S. Senator from Maryland Blair Lee; she was commissioned on 21 July 1921, with Captain C.F. Preston in command.  She was the third ship named for the state of Maryland, the first Maryland was a sloop commissioned in 1799 and the second Maryland was an armored cruiser commissioned in 1905. Maryland had an overall length of  . She had an extreme beam of   and a mean draft of  . She displaced  . Her armor was   at its maximum thickness. Her designed speed was 21 knots. Her crew complement consisted of 58 officers and 1,022 men. Marylands main battery consisted of eight 16 in (406 mm)/45  caliber Mark 6 in four double turrets (two in a superfiring pair forward, two in a superfiring pair mounted aft of the main superstructure) that were capable of firing   armor-piercing (AP) Mark 8 shells.    Her secondary battery consisted of twelve 5"/51 caliber guns as well as eight 3"/50 caliber guns. She was also armed with a pair of   submerged torpedo tubes.  She was outfitted with a new type of seaplane catapult and the first   guns mounted on a U.S. ship.  Service history Inter-war period Following her commissioning, Maryland undertook an East Coast shakedown cruise.  Shortly thereafter, Maryland was made flagship of Admiral Hilary P. Jones.  Maryland found herself in great demand for special occasions. She appeared at Annapolis, Maryland, for the 1922 United States Naval Academy graduation and at Boston, Massachusetts, for the anniversary of the battle of Bunker Hill and the Fourth of July.  From 18 August to 25 September, she paid her first visit to a foreign port transporting Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes to Rio de Janeiro for Brazil's Centennial Exposition. The next year, after fleet exercises off the Panama Canal Zone, Maryland transited the canal in the latter part of June to join the battle fleet stationed on the west coast.  She continued to be a flagship until 1923 when the flag was shifted to Pennsylvania. She made another voyage to a foreign port in 1925, this time to Australia and New Zealand. Several years later, in 1928, she transported President-elect Herbert Hoover on the Pacific leg of his tour of Latin America.  She was overhauled in 1928–1929, and the eight   anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight  /25 cal guns.  Throughout these years and the 1930s, she served as a mainstay of fleet readiness through tireless training operations.  She conducted numerous patrols in the 1930s. In 1940, Maryland and the other battleships of the battle force changed their bases of operations to Pearl Harbor.  She was present at Battleship Row along Ford Island during the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941.  Attack on Pearl Harbor     On the morning of 7 December, Maryland was moored along Ford Island, with Oklahoma to port, connected by lines and a gangway. To her fore was California, while Tennessee and West Virginia were astern. Further aft were Nevada and Arizona. The eight battleships, in what is now known as "Battleship Row," has recently returned from maneuvers. Many of Marylands crew were preparing for shore leave at 09:00 or eating breakfast when the Japanese attack began. As the first Japanese aircraft appeared and explosions rocked the outboard battleships, Maryland 's bugler blew general quarters. Seaman Leslie Short—addressing Christmas cards near his machine gun—brought the first of his ship's guns into play, shooting down one of two torpedo bombers that had just released against  . Inboard of Oklahoma, and thus protected from the initial torpedo attack, Maryland managed to bring all her antiaircraft (AA) batteries into action.  The devastating initial attack sunk Oklahoma, and she capsized quickly, with many of her surviving men climbing aboard Maryland to assist her with anti-aircraft defenses. Maryland was struck by two armor-piercing bombs which detonated low on her hull.  The first struck the forecastle awning and made a hole about   by  .  The second exploded after entering the hull at the   water level at Frame 10.  The latter hit caused flooding and increased the draft forward by  .  Maryland continued to fire and, after the attack, sent firefighting parties to assist her sister ships, especially attempting to rescue survivors from the capsized Oklahoma.  The men continued to muster the AA defenses in case the Japanese returned to attack. In all, two officers and two men were killed in the attack. The Japanese erroneously announced that Maryland had been sunk, but on 30 December, the damaged ship entered Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs just behind Tennessee.  Two of the original twelve 5 in/51 cal guns were removed and the 5 in/25 cal guns were replaced by an equal number of 5 in/38 cal dual purpose guns.  Over the course of several months, she was repaired and overhauled, receiving new fighting equipment. Repairs were complete on 26 February 1942.  She then underwent a series of shakedown cruises to West Coast ports and the Christmas Islands. She was sent back into action in June 1942, the first ship damaged at Pearl Harbor to return to duty.  Supporting patrols During the important Battle of Midway, Maryland played a supporting role. Like the other older battleships, she was not fast enough to accompany the aircraft carriers, so she operated with a backup fleet.  Maryland stood by on security, awaiting call from other ships if she was needed, until the end of the battle. At the end of the action around Midway, Maryland was sent to San Francisco. Thereafter, Maryland engaged in almost constant training exercises with Battleship Division 2, Battleship Division 3, and Battleship Division 4 until 1 August, when she returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs, her first time in the harbor since the Japanese attack. She departed Pearl Harbor in early November with Colorado, bound for the forward area.  On 12 November, the pig mascot King Neptune came aboard Maryland to initiate her "pollywogs" for the line-crossing ceremony. Maryland steamed for the Fiji Islands where she patrolled against Japanese incursion. The two battleships acted as sentinels to guard against Japanese advance to prevent Japanese forces from threatening Australia. During this duty, the two battleships conducted frequent sweeps for Japanese forces. In early 1943, with the success of the Solomon Islands campaign, Allied forces went on the offensive. In February 1943, Maryland and Colorado moved to New Hebrides, operating off of Efate.  Intense heat there proved difficult and unpleasant for the crew. She then moved to Espiritu Santo to guard against Japanese incursion, but heat and heavy rains plagued this tour of duty.  Maryland and Colorado stood out of Aore Island Harbor in August. During a five-week overhaul at Pearl Harbor's shipyard, several   AA guns were installed on the top decks and foremast as protection against anticipated Japanese air raids in future operations.  Battle of TarawaDeparting the Hawaiian Islands on 20 October for the South Pacific, Maryland became flagship for Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill's V Amphibious Force and Southern Attack Force in the Gilbert Islands Invasion.  Also aboard her were Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of 2nd Marine Division, General "Howling Mad" Smith, commander of the Marine landing forces, and Colonel Evans Carlson, commander of Carlson's Raiders. Maryland returned to Efate Island staging area, where she joined a large task force preparing to an assault on Tarawa. The battle of Tarawa commenced on 20 November. In her first offensive action of the war, Marylands guns opened fire at 05:00, destroying a shore battery with five salvos on the southwestern point of Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll. At 06:00 she commenced a scheduled shore bombardment to soften up Japanese defenses ahead the landings.  Maryland moved closer to shore to attract Japanese fire and locate artillery emplacements, in the process raking Japanese gun emplacements, control stations, pillboxes and any Japanese installations she could spot. At 09:00 as Marine landing forces encountered heavy Japanese resistance and began taking casualties to emplaced crossfire, Maryland provided covering fire to eliminate several Japanese machine gun nests. Her scouting plane then began to cover the progress of the Marines' assault, with Maryland providing artillery support. The plane was damaged and pilot wounded in this action. After three days of covering the offensive on Betio Island, she moved to Apamama Island to guard Marine landings there.  Marines met with only light resistance from 30 Japanese soldiers there, and two prisoners were brought to Maryland. On 7 December, Maryland left Apamama Island for Pearl Harbor. After a brief stopover there, Maryland left for San Francisco for repairs.  Battle of Kwajalein Atoll Maryland steamed from San Pedro, California on 13 January 1944, rendezvoused with Task Force 53 at Lahania Roads for two days of loading ammunition, refueling, and provisioning ahead of a new operation supporting the Marshall Islands campaign.  On 30 January 1944, she moved to support landings on Roi Island, along with Santa Fe, Biloxi, and Indianapolis, which formed the Northern Support Group of TF 35. In the predawn hours of 31 January, the ships began a bombardment of Kwajalein Atoll, the opening moves of the battle of Kwajalein.  Maryland destroyed numerous Japanese stationary guns and pillboxes. In the course of the battle, she fired so much that she split the liners in the guns of Turret No. 1, putting it out of action for the rest of the day. On 1 February, she continued her attack on Japanese positions as the U.S. landing forces advanced. She became the flagship for Admiral Connally for the next two weeks, resupplying and refueling many of the smaller ships in the operation until she departed with a task unit of carriers and destroyers on 15 February 1944, steaming for Bremerton Navy Yard, where she underwent another overhaul, with her guns being replaced.  Battle of Saipan Two months later, Maryland sailed westward on 5 May, joining Task Force 52 headed for Saipan.  Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner allotted TF 52 three days to soften up the island's defenses ahead of the assault. Firing commenced at 05:45 on 14 June.  The quickly destroyed two coastal guns before she began bombarding Garapan, destroying ammunition dumps, gun positions, small boats, storage tanks, blockhouses and buildings. She then turned her guns to Tanapag, leveling it in heavy bombardment. The invasion commenced 17 June, and Maryland provided fire support for the landing forces. The Japanese attempted to counter the battleships through the air. On 18 June, the ship's guns shot down their first Japanese aircraft, but on 22 June, a Mitsubishi G4M3 "Betty" medium bomber flew low over the still-contested Saipan hills and found Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Japanese plane dropped a torpedo, opening a large hole in Maryland s portside bow. The attack caused light casualties, and in 15 minutes she was underway for Eniwetok, and from there she steamed for the repair yards at Pearl Harbor,  escorted by two destroyers. Two men were killed in the attack. With an around-the-clock effort by the shipyard workers, Maryland was repaired in 34 days, departing on 13 August. She then embarked for the Solomon Islands with a large task force, anchoring in Purvis Bay off Florida Island for two weeks before steaming for the Palau Islands on 6 September.  She then joined Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Western Fire Support Group (Task Group 32.5; TG 32.5). Firing first on 12 September to cover minesweeping operations and underwater demolition teams at the opening of the battle of Peleliu, Maryland again conducted shore bombardment supporting the landing craft as they approached the beaches on 15 September.  Four days later, organized resistance collapsed, permitting the fire support ships to retire to the Admiralty Islands at the end of the month.  Battle of Leyte Gulf Maryland steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus where she was assigned to the 7th Fleet under Admiral Kincaid. The fleet sortied 12 October and Maryland joined Task Group 77.2, which was the gunfire and covering force for the invasion of Leyte.  She, along with four other battleships and numerous cruisers and destroyers, steamed into Leyte Gulf on the morning of 18 October. Maryland took position between Red and White Beaches and began bombarding them ahead of the invasion, which began at 10:00 20 October. Securing the beaches quickly, Maryland then took up a sentinel position in Leyte Gulf to guard the beaches against Japanese counterattack by sea. For the next several days, Japanese forces launched air raids to counter the incursion. These included the first widespread use of the kamikaze suicide attack. Several days later, U.S. submarines in the South China Sea spotted two Japanese forces on approach: five battleships steaming toward San Bernardino Strait, and another force of four Japanese carriers in northern Luzon. On 24 October, Maryland, California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia sailed to the southern end of Leyte Gulf to protect Surigao Strait with several cruisers, destroyers, and PT Boats. Early on 25 October, Japanese battleships   and  , with their screens, led the Japanese advance into the Strait.  At 03:55, the waiting Americans ships launched an ambush of the two Japanese battleships, pounding them with torpedoes and main guns. Torpedoes from the destroyers sunk Fusō.  Continued attacks by the task force also claimed Yamashiro. A few of the remaining Japanese ships then fled to the Mindanao Sea, pursued by Allied aircraft. Following the victory, Maryland patrolled the southern approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks.  On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland as she was covering  Denver. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turret No. 1 and Turret No. 2, piercing the forecastle, main, and armored decks and blowing a hole in the   steel, causing extensive damage and setting Maryland alight. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed. The battleship continued her patrols until relieved on 2 December, when she sailed with two heavily damaged destroyers for repairs.  She reached Pearl Harbor on 18 December, and was extensively repaired and refitted over the next several months.  Battle of Okinawa After refresher training, Maryland headed for the western Pacific on 4 March 1945, arriving Ulithi on 16 March. There she joined the 5th Fleet and Rear Admiral Morton Deyo's Task Force 54 (TF 54), which was preparing for the invasion of Okinawa. The fleet departed on 21 March, bound for Okinawa. Maryland was assigned targets on the southern coast of Okinawa to support a diversionary landing, which would distract Japanese forces away from the main landing on the west coast.  Japanese forces responded with several air raids, with two of Marylands radar picket destroyers being struck by kamikaze planes, with Luce sinking. On 3 April, she was moved to the west coast invasion beaches to assist Minneapolis in destroying several shore batteries. Following the land invasion, she remained with the support force off Bolo Point providing artillery support for the invading troops. Maryland continued fire support duty until 7 April, when she steamed north to intercept a Japanese surface force with TF 54.  The Japanese ships, including the  , came under constant U.S. air attacks that day, and planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force sank six of the 10 ships in the force. At dusk, a kamikaze loaded with a   bomb crashed the top of Turret No. 3 from starboard. The explosion wiped out the 20 mm mounts and caused a large fire. The 20mm ammunition ignited from the heat, causing further casualties.  In all, 10 were killed, 37 injured and 6 missing following this attack. Maryland remained on station for the next week and continued her artillery support mission through several more air raids. Turret No. 3, damaged but usable, remained silent for the remainder of this mission. On 14 April, Maryland left the firing line at Okinawa and escorted several retiring transports. They steamed via the Mariana Islands and Guam to Pearl Harbor,  and she reached the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton on 7 May for extensive overhaul.  All of her 5 in guns were removed and replaced by sixteen 5 inch/38 cal guns in new twin mounts.  Turret No. 3 was repaired and the crew quarters were improved. She completed repairs in August, leaving for tests and training runs just as Japan surrendered, ending the war. She next entered Operation Magic Carpet fleet.  During the remaining months of 1945, Maryland made five voyages between the west coast and Pearl Harbor, returning more than 8,000 servicemen to the United States.  Post-war Arriving at Seattle, Washington on 17 December, Maryland completed her Operation Magic Carpet duty. She entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 15 April 1946, and was placed in commission in inactive reserve on 16 July.   She was decommissioned at Bremerton on 3 April 1947, and remained there as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Maryland was sold for scrapping to Learner Company of Oakland, California on 8 July 1959. On 2 June 1961, Governor of Maryland J. Millard Tawes, dedicated a monument to the memory of Maryland and her men. Built of granite and bronze and incorporating the bell of "Fighting Mary", this monument is located on the grounds of the State House in Annapolis, Maryland.  Awards Maryland was awarded three campaign medals.

Sinepuxent, Maryland Sinepuxent or Sinepuxent Town was a village in Worcester County, Maryland, located on Sinepuxent Neck across Sinepuxent Bay from the barrier island of Assateague.  The village was destroyed by a hurricane in 1818  and never rebuilt.  Its location arose in large part from its convenience to ocean-going ships: an inlet—Sinepuxent Inlet—allowed access through Assateague Island from the Atlantic Ocean to Sinepuxent Bay, until it was closed by the same hurricane that destroyed the village.Sinepuxent was the birthplace of U.S. Navy officer Stephen Decatur in 1779.

Harmony, Maryland Harmony is a small unincorporated community in Caroline County, Maryland, United States.  It is little more than an intersection of state Routes 16 and 578 on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Its original name was Fowling Creek named after a stream nearby that is a tributary of the Choptank River. There is a small country store with one gas pump, a church, a local produce stand, and lots of farmland.  While many of the farmers in the area are of German descent as can be seen in last names such as Kraus, Steenken, and Worm; they settled later after the civil war filling the void of the men lost in the war. The older families of Towers, Todd, and Wyddel were the original settlers that came from England in the early eighteenth century as can be confirmed from the original patents granted to them one of which is Wyddels Venture, the oldest century farm in the county.The soil is sandy and requires irrigation, unlike many farms in nearby Talbot County.  There are many cash crops grown such as sweet corn, cantaloupes, tomatoes, squash, etc...  There are quite a few migrant camps for Mexican workers who help with the crops in the summer.  Most farms also have chicken houses as a second means of income. References         
St. Mary's College of Maryland   St. Mary's College of Maryland, established in 1840, is an American public, secular liberal arts college located in St. Mary's City, Maryland. It is a member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges and designated as a Public Honors College (the only one in the state of Maryland and one of few around the U.S.). With about 2,000 enrolled students, the institution offers baccalaureate degrees in 22 disciplines, of which psychology, biology, and economics are among the most popular. It also offers one postgraduate degree, a Masters of Arts in Teaching.  The college shares much of its campus with Historic St. Mary's City, the fourth site of colonization in British North America and one of the premier archaeological sites on the East Coast.  HistorySt. Mary's College of Maryland came into existence (on paper only) by an act of the Maryland State Board of Higher Education in 1966. The first bachelor’s (B.A.) degrees were awarded in 1971.The predecessor institution was St. Mary's Seminary Junior College (1949–1968), in turn preceded by St. Mary's Female Seminary Junior College (1927–1949). Both of these "junior colleges" combined the last two years of high school and the first two years of college, making it a four-year institution. After earning an associate's degree (A.A.) at St. Mary's girls would often continue studies at another university, where they would study for two more years and receive a B.A.The original St. Mary's Female Seminary was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1840. In 1840, the word "seminary" meant only that it was an academy or a high school, not a religious institution. St. Mary's was established by the legislature to be strictly non-denominational. It was a boarding school that included the elementary grades as well as grades 9-12, though education did not go beyond the 12th grade. Occasionally boys from the neighboring areas were allowed to take classes. The institution was named after St. Mary's City, the colonial site of Lord Baltimore's experiment in religious tolerance. The institution was built upon land that once had been inhabited by the colonists two hundred years before.For roughly the first 100 years (1840-1937) of its existence, the head of St. Mary's was called the "principal". When the school received accreditation as a junior college and included within the Maryland state budget in 1937, the term "principal" was changed to "president".  In 2010, Joseph Urgo became the institution's president. General information The campus borders the St. Mary's River.St. Mary's, although a state-operated institution, is independent of the University System of Maryland; it opted out of the system in 1992. However, in early 2006, St. Mary's joined the University of Maryland Academic Telecommunications System (UMATS), which interconnects the University System of Maryland with several other networks, including the Internet and Internet2 networks. St. Mary's mascot is the Seahawk, which is a nickname for the ospreys that can be found nesting in the near off-shore areas. The school colors are navy blue, yellow gold, and white. The Seahawks compete in NCAA Division III. St. Mary's athletics are recognized for the storied varsity baseball team and the nationally-ranked varsity sailing team. Green initiativesGoodpaster Hall, an academic building devoted to chemistry, psychology, and educational studies that opened in January 2008, was built to a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating of Silver. It is one of few "green" buildings in the state of Maryland. Other green initiatives include a student-supported green energy referendum, campus composting, and a geothermal system in the new River Center. Mission statement"Founded on the site of Maryland's first capital, the College stands as a living legacy to the ideals of freedom and inclusiveness. Our beautiful residential campus on the banks of the St. Mary's River inspires our work, our play, and our commitment to the environment."   Student data  As of Fall 2008, the college had 2,035 students. 57% of students are female, 43% male. 17% of students are from out of state. 96.36% of students attend full-time. 76.36% of students are Caucasian, 8.11% are African-American, 4.47% are Hispanic, 3.88% are Asian, 0.69% are American Indian or Alaskan Native, 4.32% have undetermined ethnicity, and 2.16% are international.  Thirty-seven countries are represented among the students. The student:faculty ratio in the Fall of 2008 was 11.66:1.    Relationship with historic St. Mary's CitySt. Mary's College of Maryland and the historic St. Mary's City have a close relationship. Students are often hired to work within the historic site, and those who are not working are frequently found to be walking or biking along the miles of trail throughout Historic. Students may visit the historical site for free. The Maryland Heritage Project is an effort to bring together the college, historic St. Mary's City, Trinity Episcopal, a church located near the St. Mary's campus, and the wider community. Two new buildings, to be used jointly by the college and Historic St. Mary's City, are being built on campus. One of the buildings is a new interpretive center, which will showcase artifacts from St. Mary's City history – from the colony established in 1634, to the farmlands that replaced that colony in the 18th century, to the founding of the monument school in the mid-19th century, and beyond. The second building will be an academic building that will replace Anne Arundel Hall, a current St. Mary's academic building. This building will include Historic St. Mary's City's research offices, and faculty offices and classrooms for St. Mary's College in anthropology, democracy studies, history, international languages and cultures, and museum studies. It will host collection-based courses and summer institutes.

Polar Bear Splash: an annual effort to raise awareness for Global Warming. More than one hundred students take a swim in the freezing St. Mary's River during this mid-winter event.  Shoe Tree: For a lot of students, throwing a pair of shoes or flip-flops tied together into the shoe tree marks a memorable "first time" on the college campus—i.e. losing one's virginity.  On Easter, the upperclassmen prepare the Natty Boh Hunt by buying large quantities of National Bohemian and spray painting them and hiding them all around campus for the freshmen to find.  An Occasional 40 will be bought and spray painted gold, known as a Golden 40. On May 1 (May Day) students streak through campus on bicycles. This represents freedom, especially for seniors. Clothed students stand on the sidelines and "offer support".  Every April the SMCM Rock Climbing Club sponsors a huge Bouldering (rock climbing) competition called "Friction Fest" which is free and open to both students, staff, faculty, community and the local Navy Base members. SEVEN WONDERSThe Seven Wonders are seven notable campus landmarks.  New students are inducted into the traditions of SMCM by orientation leaders in a tour of the Seven Wonders during orientation and it is a graduation tradition for the departing class to tour the seven wonders and recount stories the evening before graduation. Thus a student's time at SMCM begins and ends with tours of the Seven Wonders. The seven "wonders" are:  1. The Shoe Tree (see above) 2. The Bell Tower  3. St. John's Pond (see above) 4. Maryland Freedom of Conscience Statue on Route 5 (a.k.a. The Naked Man) 5. Garden of Remembrance Fountain  6. 'Hidden' Grave 7.

It is the 12th-largest university system in the United States, with over 125,000 undergraduate, 43,000 graduate and roughly 13,000 combined full-time and part-time faculty.  In 1988, it was created from the merger of the five University of Maryland institutions and the six members of the State University and College System of Maryland under the name University of Maryland System. In 1997, its name was changed to the University System of Maryland. In 1999, the Maryland General Assembly transformed the system to the charter model.   The system headquarters are in unincorporated Adelphi in Prince George's County. The merger creating the University of Maryland System was directed by Governor William Donald Schaefer and was overseen by University of Maryland President John S.

Point of Rocks, Maryland   Point of Rocks is a community in Frederick County, Maryland.  It is named for the striking rock formation on the adjacent Catoctin Mountain, which were formed by the Potomac River cutting through the ridge in a water gap, a typical formation in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians.  The formation is not visible from the town and can only be seen from boats on the river, or from the southern bank of the river in Virginia. TransportationThe community contains the Point of Rocks Bridge of U.S. Route 15 over the Potomac River into Virginia.  The bridge is the first such crossing of the river upstream of the  American Legion Memorial Bridge on I-495 in Montgomery County. The only other crossing between them is White's Ferry.Point of Rocks is a passenger station stop on the MARC Brunswick Line. The station, designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin, was built by the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) Railroad and completed in 1876. Marking the junction between CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision (the current main line) and the Old Main Line Subdivision, it remains one of the former B&O's signature landmarks, and is a popular subject of railroad photography. HistoryIn 1828, the narrow passage between the rocks at this site provoked a violent legal battle between the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) Canal Company and the B&O Railroad over who could have control of the narrow pass.    After years of disputes, both companies finally compromised and allowed both canal and railroad to build on the right-of-way through the passage,  with a wall between the two to avoid trains scaring the mules that pulled the canal boats.During the American Civil War, the town was often raided by Confederate partisans, such as John S. Mosby, Elijah V. White and John Mobberly, operating in Loudoun County, Virginia.  The presence of the B&O railroad and C&O canal along with many exiled Unionists from Loudoun made the town such an attractive target.In 2001 Duke Energy filed an application with the Maryland Public Service Commission to construct a power plant on the north edge of town. In November 2002, however, Duke officially canceled its proposal, though it retains property in the area. The Point of Rocks Railroad Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and St. Paul's Episcopal Church was listed in 1978.    FloodingOlder portions of the town are on the Potomac River floodplain and have been repeatedly inundated.  An ongoing Federal Emergency Management Agency program to reduce flood insurance payouts has resulted in the purchase and demolition of a large portion of structures on the lowest-lying properties.

Music of Maryland   Maryland is a U.S. state with a musical heritage that dates back to the Native Americans of the region and includes contributions to colonial era music, modern American popular and folk music. The music of Maryland includes a number of popular musicians, folk styles and a documented music history that dates to the colonial archives on music from Annapolis, an important source in research on colonial music. Famous modern musicians from Maryland range from jazz singer Billie Holiday to pop punk band Good Charlotte, and include a wide array of popular styles.Modern Maryland is home to many well-regarded music venues, including the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Baltimore Opera, and the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music. Baltimore, the largest city in the state, is home to many important local venues, such as the Red Room, a center for the local experimental music scene, and the house nightspot Club Choices.   Outside of Baltimore, Frederick's Weinberg Center for the Arts and Rockville's Strathmore are also important regional venues. The Merriweather Post Pavilion and 1st Mariner Arena host most of the largest concerts in the area. Since HFStival ended its successful run in 2006, Virgin Festival has taken over as one of the most popular summer festivals on the east coast since its inaugural year in 2006. InstitutionsMost of the major musical organizations in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music. These include Baltimore Choral Arts and the Baltimore Opera, as well as the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO).   The founding of the Peabody in 1857 would dramatically change the musical life of Maryland. Nearly all of Baltimore's major musical organizations – the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Baltimore Opera, Baltimore Choral Arts, and a host of smaller organizations – owe their existence to Peabody musicians.  The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra formed in 1916 and was the only orchestra in the country to operate as a branch of the city's government.    In 1942, the orchestra was reorganized as a private institution. The Orchestra claims that Joseph Meyerhoff, President of the Orchestra beginning in 1965, and his music director, Sergiu Comissiona, began the modern history of the BSO and "ensured the creation of an institution, which has become the undisputed leader of the arts community throughout the State of Maryland".   Meyerhoff appointed Romanian-born conductor Sergiu Comissiona as music director; together, the visionary philanthropist and the charismatic conductor ensured the creation of an artistic institution, which has become the undisputed leader of the arts community throughout the State of Maryland. Aside from the prominent Baltimore Symphony, Maryland is also home to several other institutions. The Annapolis Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1962, is a well-known organization that has hosted guests like Cuban violinist Guillermo Perich and Charlie Byrd; the Annapolis Orchestra inspired composer David Ott to create the Annapolis Overture, which debuted in 1995.    The Rohrersville Cornet Band, part of Maryland's cornet band heritage, claims to be the oldest continually performing community band in the state, having been founded in 1837; it now performs in a dedicated music hall in Rohrersville.     The Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras (MCYO) was formed in the 1946 to "nurture, develop and advance young talented musicians in a quality orchestral program". Beginning in 1964, the Orchestras began to offer new programs, such as a summer camp that eventually became the Maryland Center for the Arts.    Venues and festivals   The largest music venue in Maryland is the Merriweather Post Pavilion, opened in 1967 and designed by architect Frank Gehry to avoid disturbing as much as possible the surrounding Symphony Woods; it is an outdoor performance area, home to most of the largest concerts that come through the area.    In the 1990s and early 2000s, HFStival, held by the WHFS radio station, established itself as an extremely popular annual festival, and became a major draw across the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Since 2006, Virgin Festival has established itself as a hugely popular festival annually held at Pimlico Race Course, drawing in a variety of popular acts.    The Takoma Park Folk Festival is also well-known among folk music aficionados, and has been held annually since 1978 in Takoma Park, Maryland.   Baltimore is home to several important concert spaces, including the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Concordia Hall and the Lyric Opera House. The Meyerhoff is home to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Concordia Hall is a long-standing venue, founded in 1867 by German musical societies, which were then a large portion of Baltimore's population.  The Lyric Opera House, founded in 1894, is another important Baltimore music venue; it has hosted many of the most famous performers and public speakers to come to Baltimore.     Smaller Hardcore and Punk acts play at the Charm City Art Space.The city of Frederick is home to the Weinberg Centre for the Arts, which shows various kinds of theatrical and musical productions. The Weinberg was originally a large movie theater called the Tivoli, opened in 1926; the Tivoli was destroyed in a flood in 1976, and was reopened as the Weinberg Center two years later.    North Bethesda's Strathmore opened in 1976, and is now a home for numerous programs, including the largest of its music venues, the Music Center at Strathmore; the Strathmore has hosted well-known musicians and composers like the cellist Steven Honigberg, pianist Christopher Taylor, jazz singers Nnenna Freelon and Luciana Souza and composers Virgil Thomson and Gunther Schuller, as well as DC-area cult acts like the founder of Go-go, Chuck Brown, and the reunited punk band The Slickee Boys.    HistoryThe documented music history of Maryland begins during the colonial era, in the 18th century. Prior to that, Native Americans lived in the state, but left behind few traces of their musical life. The city of Annapolis was a major center for music during the colonial era; the city's Tuesday Club left behind documentation of musical life in Annapolis, one of the most complete sources for musical knowledge about that era in the United States. The larger city of Baltimore eventually replaced Annapolis as a center for music in Maryland, and eventually became home to most of the prominent music institutions in the state, especially the Peabody Institute. Later still, Baltimore's Pennsylvania Avenue became a very well known home for African American music, especially jazz, while Maryland began producing popular musicians like The Orioles. In modern times, Maryland has been a home for styles including emo and hardcore punk. Colonial eraThere is little historical record of music in Maryland prior to the 18th century; the Native Americans of the area left little or no trace of their musical life. A few instruments, such as drums and trumpets, are known to have existed in the early history of the Maryland colony, probably as a functional means "of calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military"; some folk dancing and ballad singing is also substantiated by the historical record. The early colonists had little tradition of any performance art, due to the small number of individuals, their low standard of living and great poverty and disease.   The few drums, trumpets, and other musical instruments recorded in seventeenth-century Maryland most likely played a functional role in calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military. A few references to ballad-singing and informal dancing pre-date 1700; there is no evidence of theatrical activities at this time. With the arrival of large numbers of slaves, however, some white plantation owners earned enough wealth to invest in music and dance. The upper class used instruments like the flute, violin and harpsichord and danced formal dances like the stately minuet or English country dance, while the lower classes preferred reels and jigs, accompanied by various kinds of guitars, drums, banjos, transverse flutes and recorders, as well as, more rarely, hammered dulcimers and harpsichords. Local music groups during the colonial era did much to sponsor musical development. Annapolis, a major center for colonial music in North America, was home to the Homony Club and the Tuesday Club, while the Freemasons held balls and concerts across Maryland. Unlike the northern United States, religious music did not prosper in Maryland until the end of the colonial period, and then only in Baltimore in the German communities of Carroll, Montgomery and Frederick countries.    Tavern owners frequently sponsored dances and concerts during the colonial era. Beginning in 1752, theater became a major part of Maryland culture for colonists of all classes; performances included light dance and incidental music, ballad operas and the works of William Shakespeare.  David K. Hildebrand and Elizabeth Schaaf date the first theatrical seasons in Maryland as 1752, 1760, and more regularly from 1769 to 1773  Aside from the cultural capital of Annapolis, the cities of Baltimore, Upper Marlboro and Chestertown were major homes for Maryland theater, home to the debuts of the latest and most popular dances. With the French and Indian War and then the American Revolution, soldiers brought back home to Maryland military band music, especially fife and drum ensembles.  Early independence and 19th centuryProfessional theater in Maryland died out during the Revolution but was reestablished by 1780, now with Baltimore having replaced Annapolis as a cultural capital in the state.   Although the fear of war forced theater troupes to leave Maryland by 1774, theatrical activities resumed with renewed vigor in the early 1780s in Baltimore, the new state's post-Revolutionary cultural capital.  Maryland ratified the Constitution on April 28, 1788 and became the 7th state. The Holiday Street Theater in Baltimore opened in 1793 and was one of the first large theaters in the country, showcasing light theater, opera, and concerts. In 1822, Arthur Clifton from Baltimore debuted his opera The Enterprise, while religious music flourished after the 1821 opening of the Catholic Cathedral in the country. The African Methodist Episcopal churches in Maryland were home to singing traditions using the shape-note method. By the turn of the century, the middle classes of Maryland were holding regular dances featuring the cotillion, quadrille, schottische, polka and waltz. Eastern European dances were also popular, brought by immigrants from various countries. Many immigrants in Maryland moved to Baltimore, forming their own distinct neighborhoods with German liederkranz singing societies, and Irish St. Patrick's Day parades and Jewish chants flourished among their respective communities. Maryland was home to several folk traditions, including the work songs of rail and canal diggers and the crab- and oystermen of the Chesapeake Bay, whose repertoire varied from hymns to risqué songs and Bahaman shanties. By the middle of the 19th century, Baltimore was a major center of sheet music publishing, home to Joseph Carr, F. D. Benteen, John Cole and George Willig, as well as the piano-building businesses of William Knabe and Charles Stieff. This period also saw the rise of blackface minstrel shows, featuring the pseudo-African American songs of composers like Dan Emmett and Stephen Foster. During the Civil War, Maryland was a border state, home to people who sympathized with both sides of the conflict. Federal troops occupied Baltimore, and some people who wrote music that favored the Confederacy were jailed; these pieces included "The Confederacy March", "Stonewall Jackson's Way" and "Maryland, My Maryland", the last later becoming Maryland's state song. The Civil War left several lasting effects on American music nationwide, most importantly the normalization of white and black cultural mixing, especially in music, caused by the mixing of soldiers in multiracial units; military brass bands became a popular part of the music scene during and after the war, one of the first being the Moxley Band from Frederick. The middle of the 19th century saw a wave of immigration from Europe into the United States, including a large number of German musicians who settled in Baltimore; the presence of these musicians, as well as the general growth in urban population with the industrial revolution and the continued rise of the music publishing industry, helped make music training more affordable for more Americans. Conservatories, institutes of music education, were introduced to the United States in the mid to late 19th century, beginning with Baltimore's Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music, founded in 1857. The Peabody trained numerous musicians who went on to found most of Baltimore's major musical organizations, including the Baltimore Opera, Baltimore Choral Arts and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Though founded in 1857, the Peabody Institute did not hold an orchestral concert until after the Civil War, when James Monroe Deems directed a concert; Deems was a musician and composer, known for Nebuchadnezzar, one of the first American oratorios. He was succeeded by Lucien Southard, who failed to organize the Institute (then known as the Academy of Music), blaming the lack of a "proper musical atmosphere" in Baltimore. It was not until Asger Hamerik's reign that the Peabody Symphony Orchestra finally became successful, one of only five professional orchestras in the country at the time. Hamerik was an advocate of American music and regularly included the works of American composers, eschewing the more typical European programs. The Peabody during Hamerik's leadership produced such noted individuals as Otto Sutro, publisher, music store owner and host of a music society called the Wednesday Club, and with fellow Peabody alum Fritz Finke, founder of the Oratorio Society. In 1871, Ford's Grand Opera House opened, followed three years later by the Academy of Music; this new Academy of Music shared the name with the Peabody Institute's organization, but in the same year changed to the Conservatory of Music. The Academy's conductor, Adam Itzel, Jr. was a very popular composer, known for the national hit light opera The Tar and the Tartar.  Early 20th centuryThere were a number of mostly informal musical societies in Maryland by the end of the 19th century, including the famous Saturday Night Club of H. L. Mencken and the influential Florestan Club, which hosted such musicians as Mischa Elman, Leopold Stokowski and Walter Damrosch. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra was the first permanent orchestra in the city since 1895, when the Peabody Orchestra dissolved; it opened in 1916 with conductor Gustav Strube; this came only three year's after the formation of the short-lived Baltimore Opera Society, which was eventually replaced by the Baltimore Opera in 1927. While the largely white middle- and upper-class Baltimoreans supported the orchestras and other societies, the city's African Americans formed their own Coloured Symphony Orchestra in 1931, which was municipally supported just like the BSO; the first performance included Ellis Larkins and Anne Brown, the latter known for creating the role of Bess in Porgy and Bess. At the time, Pennsylvania Avenue (often known simply as The Avenue) was the major scene for Baltimore's black musicians, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others.    Folk musicMaryland's folk music heritage remains little studied. There have been no major musicological studies in Maryland, though some Anglo-American and African American folk songs have been documented. The Library of Congress' American Folklife Center has a library of recorded Maryland folk music, which includes a wide array of songs and styles, including Bahamanian spirituals, Mexican music, African American blues, Appalachian folk music, steelpan and gospel music, and Piscataway Native American music.    Maryland's folk heritage also includes the traditional music of the German communities of central and western Maryland. Cornet bands, such as the Rohrersville Cornet Band, are also a prominent part of Maryland's folk heritage.The oystermen and others who work on the Chesapeake Bay have their own distinct folk song styles which include hymns and work songs. Some locally popular performers have used these folk themes in their music, including Bob Zentz and Steve Keith, all of whom have appeared on records by the Annapolis Maritime Museum's Chesapeake Music Institute. The Piedmont blues, a style of blues music, is most closely associated with the music of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina, but also exists in Maryland, which has produced modern performers like Warner Williams and Jay Summerour. Bill Jackson, born 1906, from Granite, Maryland was an obscure Piedmont blues guitarist and singer. He was discovered by Pete Welding and recorded his first and only record in 1962. The Piedmont blues arose from a mixture of black gospel music with white string ensembles, and is characterized by a style of guitar playing influenced by ragtime and country music.    Popular music Maryland has produced popular musicians from many fields, including doo wop and hardcore punk, as well as the gangsta rap of Tupac Shakur, the contemporary R&B of Toni Braxton and the pop of Cass Elliott. Though doo wop can be traced to many urban areas across the United States, especially New York City, Sonny Til's 1946 band called The Vibranaires, later known as The Orioles, can be considered the first doo wop group.     The genre-crossing Frank Zappa was also from Maryland, as was Tupac Shakur, who was born in Harlem, though he began his career in Baltimore, eventually becoming one of the most famous rappers in hip hop history. Maryland has also produced many renowned jazz musicians, such as Eubie Blake, Elmer Snowden and Billie Holiday.  The Urbanite magazine describes Baltimore jazz as variously a wildly varying array of styles or a "hard bop town, where R&B, gospel and bebop meet"; The Urbanite The varying styles claim is cited to Andy Bienstock of WYPR, while the "hard bop town" is attributed to Benny Russell of the Maryland Conservatory of Music's Jazz Department  during the middle of the 20th century, Baltimore produced a vibrant local jazz tradition characterized by the use of the B3 organ. Many modern Baltimorean jazz musicians are renowned saxophonists, including Gary Thomas, Gary Bartz and the Afro-Caribbean influenced TK Blue. Internationally acclaimed jazz ensemble Fertile Ground lead by Baltimore native James H. Collins Jr. are also based in Baltimore. Famed Talking Heads lead singer David Byrne lived in Baltimore. Jimmie's Chicken Shack, Good Charlotte, All Time Low, and O.A.R. are other popular American rock bands with strong ties to Maryland.Mama Cass Elliot of The Mamas & the Papas was from Maryland, and began her singing career there. Another Maryland band similar to the Mamas and Papas, the Peppermint Rainbow, was discovered by Mama Cass and had a top forty hit with the song "Will you be staying after Sunday". Maryland-based band The Ravyns are also notable for having their song "Raised on the Radio" appear on the soundtrack to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The Dundalk-based Chorus of the Chesapeake won international championships in 1961 and 1971.Baltimore's hardcore punk scene has been overshadowed by DC's, but included locally renowned bands like Law & Order, Bollocks, OTR, and Fear of God; many of these bands played at bars like the Marble Bar, Terminal 406 and the illegal space Jule's Loft, which author Steven Blush described as the "apex of the Baltimore (hardcore) scene" in 1983 and 1984. The 1980s also saw the development of a local New Wave scene led by the bands Ebeneezer & the Bludgeons, Null Set, and Here Today (later Vigil (band)). Later in the decade, emo bands like Reptile House and Grey March had some success and recorded with Ian MacKaye in DC.     Some early Baltimore punk musicians moved onto other local bands by the end of the 1990s, resulting in local mainstays Lungfish and Fascist Fascist, who became regionally prominent.  The Urbanite magazine has identified several major trends in local Baltimorean music, including the rise of psychedelic-folk singer-songwriters like Entrance and the house/hip hop dance fusion called Baltimore club, pioneered by DJs like Rod Lee. More recently, Baltimore's indie rock scene has produced performers like Slot Racer, Cass McCombs and Mary Prankster.   Maryland has had a thriving doom metal scene since the early 90s, and is now considered to have its own "Maryland doom" sound.  This scene was started in the late 70s with The Obsessed, a band led by Scott "Wino" Weinrich. During this time, Northern Virginia's Pentagram also had a heavy influence on the Maryland scene. After disbanding The Obsessed in the mid 80s and moving to California to sing with doom legends Saint Vitus, Wino reformed The Obsessed and signed to the German based Hellhound Records. With The Obsessed on board, Hellhound began to sign other Maryland bands, such as Wretched, Iron Man, Unorthodox, Internal Void, and Revelation (who already had an album on Rise Above Records). After Hellhound's demise in the late 90s, many Maryland doom bands were picked up by various other labels, including Southern Lord Records. After The Obsessed second break up, Wino formed Spirit Caravan and The Hidden Hand. Both have been very successful in the doom genre. Other current Maryland doom bands include Earthride, Nitroseed, and Black Manta.80's metal band, Kix are from Hagerstown. Death metal band Dying Fetus are from Upper Marlboro. Heavy Metal band Incision are from Maryland. Progressive metal band Periphery are from Bethesda.The annual Maryland Deathfest has become a popular festival for extreme music.Maryland has a thriving experimental music scene, based around Baltimore. The local scene is led by artists and groups such as Dan Deacon, Double Dagger and North Carolina imports Future Islands. Famed group Animal Collective had their beginnings in the suburbs surrounding Baltimore, and named their breakout 2009 album Merriweather Post Pavilion after the famed Pavilion in Columbia.

Maryland, London     Maryland is a location in east London.  It forms the northeastern part of Stratford in the London Borough of Newham.  The area borders Leytonstone to the north, Stratford New Town to the west and Forest Gate to the east, with the centre of Stratford to the south-west. HistoryMaryland's earliest known recorded appearance is on a map of Essex published by J. Oliver in 1696, where it is marked as 'Maryland Point'.  The name originated with a rich local merchant who bought land and built in the area having returned from the American colony of Maryland.  London's Maryland is therefore an unusual example of a place in Britain named after an American location, rather than vice versa.Various attempts have been made to identify the merchant.  The most likely candidate seems to be Richard Lee  (d. 1664), who emigrated to Virginia around 1640.  His estate there included land on the Maryland side of the Potomac River, near a place known as Maryland Point (later to be the site of the Maryland Point Light).  On returning to England in 1658, Lee bought land in Stratford, and in 1662 was recorded as owning a large house there. Notable people associated with Maryland  Charles Edmund Clutterbuck, stained glass artist Dorothy Kilner (1755–1836), children's writer Anna Kingsford, anti-vivisectionist, theosophist, suffragette and campaigner for women's rights, née Bonus, born Maryland Point 1846 Tempa T, Grime artist and creator of underground hit "Next Hype"   Transport  Maryland Station is served by trains operated by Greater Anglia, with a frequency of approximately 10 minutes in each direction.  Trains towards central London stop at Stratford before terminating at Liverpool Street station, with a journey time of just 10 minutes.  To the East, trains run a stopping service terminating at Shenfield.  Maryland Station will be served by Crossrail trains when that project is completed. Maryland is served by bus routes 69 (24hr), 257, 308, and night bus N8.   RegenerationMany small and ongoing redevelopment programmes are linked to the opening of the Stratford International station on High Speed 1, the 2012 Olympic Games, and the Stratford City complex, all of which are adjacent to Maryland.

Maryland Transit Administration    The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated mass transit administration in Maryland, and is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is better known as MTA Maryland to avoid confusion with other cities' transit agencies who share the initials MTA. The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. There are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car,  the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture. The system has many connections to other transit agencies of Central Maryland: WMATA, Charm City Circulator, Howard Transit, Connect-A-Ride, Annapolis Transit, Rabbit Transit, Ride-On, and  TransIT. History  The MTA took over the operations of the old Baltimore Transit Company on April 30, 1970.    It was originally known as the Baltimore Metropolitan Transit Authority, then the Mass Transit Administration before it changed to its current name in October 2001. Many of the routes of most of the agency's current bus lines are based on the original streetcars operated by the Baltimore Transit Company and its parent companies from the 1890s to the 1960s. All these routes were ultimately converted to rubber tire bus operations, and many of them were consolidated, extended into newly developed areas, or otherwise reconfigured to keep up with the ridership demands of the times.  Additional routes and extensions were added in later years to serve communities that were later developed, and to feed into Metro and Light Rail stations that were later built.With the growth in popularity of the private automobile during the 20th century, streetcar and bus ridership declined, and the needs for public transportation changed. Mass transit in Baltimore and other cities shifted from a corporate operation to a tax-subsidized state-run service. The amount of service provided was greatly reduced, and some areas once served by streetcars are currently served by buses very minimally or not at all.  The demise of the Baltimore streetcar took place between the years of 1947 and 1963, as operators found buses to be low maintenance and more cost-efficient. As rails were demolished, Baltimore was no longer a streetcar city.  As transit needs and trends changed, rail transit did return to the city, with the Metro Subway opening in 1983 and the Light Rail in 1992.  Bus services Bus services operate throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and other parts of the state. These include local bus routes which serve areas of Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Anne Arundel County. Neighborhood shuttle service operating in specific Baltimore City areas, mainly in the northwest region. QuickBus operates limited-stop service throughout the city. Commuter, express, and intercounty connector bus routes operate within other parts of the state usually via highways or Interstate. Local busLocal bus lines are identified by a one- or two-digit number. There are currently forty-five local bus routes throughout the urban and suburban area of Baltimore City numbered 1 through 99. Bus Routes. MTA Maryland. Retrieved 2010-08-30  QuickbusThe MTA currently operates four limited-stop routes known as Quickbus or qb, which are designated as routes qb40, qb46, qb47, and qb48.  Neighborhood Shuttle BugThe MTA has two neighborhood shuttle routes: The Mondawmin Shuttle Bug Route 97 and the Hampden Shuttle Bug Route 98. These routes can be identified by their distinctive brand colors and logos Express busThe MTA operates four express bus lines in the Baltimore area, which are the 104, 120, 150, and 160.  Commuter bus Independent bus companies operate 21 commuter bus routes in the Washington D.C and Baltimore regions. There are five Baltimore-bound bus lines numbered in the 300 and 400 range; while the sixteen Washington-bound bus lines are numbered in the 900 range.  These routes range from 310 through 995. Intercounty Connector busBuses travelling on MD 200 are numbered in the 200 range. Five routes ranging 201 through 205.  Rail services Heavy rail (Metro Subway) This system operates elevated and underground from a corporate and shopping complex in Owings Mills in Baltimore County into the heart of Downtown Baltimore City's business, shopping and sightseeing districts to the world-renowned Johns Hopkins Medical Center Complex. The   northwest-southeastbound route includes 14 station stops.  Its route through the densest parts of the city is underground, from Hopkins Hospital to a portal west of Mondawmin station, where it immediately rises to an elevated concrete right of way parallel to Wabash Avenue practically at the city line.Entering Baltimore County, the line goes to surface, passing through and virtually dividing communities along the way to commuter based stops at Milford Mill Road (Pikesville) and Old Court Road (Pikesville). From Old Court, the tracks pass underneath the I-695/795 interchange, and travel the median of 795 till their end at Owings Mills (Painter's Mill Road) This station is the centerpiece of a huge project intending to urbanize that immediate area, with a Baltimore County Public Library branch, and classroom space for the Community College of Baltimore County under construction.  Residential and commercial development is planned to follow the completion of the education buildings.There are efforts underway to extend the line northeast through the city with phase 1 to Morgan State University and phase 2 beyond the city limits to the White Marsh Town Center area. If they come to fruit, the line will be renamed the Green Line, coordinating with the new Red Line (east-west Woodlawn/Security-Hopkins Bayview Hospital) in its preliminary engineering stage. Funding for the Green Line extension is still years from being secured but includes an option to extend it as light rail or BRT from Johns Hopkins Hospital. Light rail This service travels from a corporate, hotel, and shopping complex in Baltimore County’s Hunt Valley, through the suburbs north of Baltimore and northern Baltimore City and into the heart of downtown Baltimore's shopping, sightseeing, dining, and entertainment districts, past the harbor and through southern Baltimore City and finally to BWI Marshall Airport and Cromwell Station/Glen Burnie in Anne Arundel County. There is also a spur to Amtrak’s Baltimore Penn Station.The Light Rail operates at grade for the most part, though it travels on bridges crossing several bodies of water. There are 33 station stops along the   system. Although much of the line was single-tracked when it was built, the MTA completed a double-tracking project on February 26, 2006,  and now only a few short single-track sections remain.  Commuter rail (MARC) This service operates three lines that provide commuter rail service to riders out of and into Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Frederick, Perryville, and Martinsburg, WV, as well as several other locations in between. Mobility services  ParatransitThe MTA began offering paratransit service for persons with disabilities in 1978 when it took over a mobility service in Baltimore previously operated by Lutheran Family Services.  This mobility service is a "non-fixed route" service and consists of a fleet of specially converted Ford E-Series vans and Ford Crown Victorias. Some service is contracted out to MV Transportation and Veolia Transportation, but all vehicles are owned by MTA.  Taxi AccessA sub-service of the Paratransit program is MTA's Taxi Access program, designed with technology made by a company called MJM Management. The Taxi Access program ensures that any sufficiently physically disabled person that consistently requires Paratransit service can also qualify for the Taxi Access program. The Taxi Access program allows the bearer of a Taxi Access card to take a taxicab door-to-door within the limits of anywhere MTA Paratransit vans go; i.e. within 1/3 of a mile of an MTA public transit stop of any kind. Once the trip is complete, total out-of-pocket cost for the customer is $3.00, and the MTA picks up the rest of the price of the fare, "paying" it to the driver in the form of a voucher that s/he later redeems at his/her cab company headquarters.  Proposed servicesCurrently the MTA is studying a number of proposed services, which includes the Red Line (a proposed east–west light rail line that would pass from Woodlawn pass near Patterson Park) to Johns Hopkins Bayview Med. Ctr. and the Green Line (a proposed north–south line that would extend from the Johns Hopkins Hospital into northeast Baltimore, possibly as an extension of the Metro Subway). As of summer 2011, the Red Line has received federal permission to enter preliminary engineering.  Efforts to fund both lines continue, with overall priority going to the Red Line as of now.Outside of Baltimore the MTA is also studying the Purple Line between Bethesda and New Carrollton, and the Corridor Cities Transitway between Gaithersburg and Clarksburg. Both studies are evaluating bus rapid transit and light rail options. FaresThese are the current fare prices for MTA buses, Light Rail, and Metro Subway travel.  There is a separate fare structure for MARC Train services. Single-Trip fare  Service Regular fare Reduced fare  Neighborhood Shuttle $1.00 $0.50  Local bus, QuickBus, Light Rail, Metro Subway $1.60 $0.55  Express bus $2.00 $0.95  Commuter bus varies by destination varies by destination  Inter-County Connector bus $5.00 $3.20  MARC train varies by destination varies by destination   Round-Trip fare  Service Regular fare Reduced fare  Local bus, QuickBus, Neighborhood Shuttle, Light Rail, Metro Subway $3.20 $1.60  Express bus $3.60 $2.00  Commuter bus varies by destination varies by destination  Inter-County Connector bus varies by destination varies by destination  MARC train varies by destination varies by destination   Day Pass fare  Service Regular fare Reduced fare  Local bus, QuickBus, Neighborhood Shuttle, Light Rail, Metro Subway $3.50 $1.20  Express bus $3.90 $1.60  Commuter bus varies by destination varies by destination  Inter-County Connector bus varies by destination varies by destination  MARC train varies by destination varies by destination   Weekly Pass fare  Service Regular fare Reduced fare  Local bus, QuickBus, Neighborhood Shuttle, Light Rail, Metro Subway $16.50   Express bus $16.50   Commuter bus varies by destination varies by destination  Inter-County Connector bus varies by destination varies by destination  MARC train varies by destination varies by destination   Monthly Pass fare  Service Regular fare Reduced fare  Local bus, QuickBus, Neighborhood Shuttle, Light Rail, Metro Subway $64.00 $16.50  Express bus $80.00 $16.90  Commuter bus varies by destination varies by destination  Inter-County Connector bus varies by destination varies by destination  MARC train varies by destination varies by destination    Note: Express bus fare is $0.40 plus from base fare on Local bus, Neighborhood Shuttle, Light Rail, and Metro Subway services.   Paratransit  Type Cost (USD)  One-Way $1.85    Note: People who qualify for paratransit services can use all MTA rail and bus services free of charge.   Fare collection methodsPrior to the summer of 2005, the MTA used an older fare collection system. Day passes purchased on buses were printed out by a separate machine from the bus fareboxes. It was possible to alter these passes so that they could used on other days and to sell them to other passengers ot make duplicate passes and sell them to others for cheaper than the MTA's official fares. This was despite the fact that they were officially non-transferable.The MTA has since installed new fareboxes on all of its buses that issue daily passes with magnetic strips; new ticket vending machines at Light Rail and Metro Subway stations issue identical passes including the weekly and monthly passes. Weekly and monthly passes are not sold on buses. The newer day passes can be used only on the appropriate day because the machine encodes the date and expiration time in the magnetic strip, which is read when swiped through the magnetic reader. Swiping the pass also sets a time waiting period on reuse so the pass cannot be immediately handed to a different passenger and used for free boarding. This also makes it difficult for passengers to use counterfeit passes when boarding the bus, Light Rail, and Metro Subway.The MTA continues to struggle with passengers who purchase day passes, use them, then resell them at a direct loss to the agency. State employees who possess a Maryland State Employee ID card can ride MTA local bus, Light Rail, and the Metro Subway free of charge. Any state employee with the ID card can get a continuation ticket to get through the gates on the Metro Subway. For the bus, the person shows the state employee ID card to the driver when boarding. On the Light Rail, they have to show the ID card only in the event of a fare inspection while other passengers show their tickets. MTA employees can also ride free of charge if they carry their MTA employee ID card.  The MARC train service is preparing for the eventual integration with the regional SmarTrip smartcard-based fare system.  The system will involve conductors using hand-held units to validate SmarTrip cards as well as the MTA's Maryland Transit Pass. Maryland transit pass  The MTA plans to begin selling smart cards under the name CharmCard.  These will be similar to, and compatible with, the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority's regional smart card system, the SmarTrip card. When the CharmCard system is fully implemented, it will be used not only on Maryland Transit Administration transit services, but will also be able to be used in Washington D.C. on all WMATA buses, the Washington Metro and on most local bus services in Northern Virginia. Likewise, the WMATA SmarTrip card will be accepted by the fareboxes used by the MTA.  Special programs  Baltimore City Public School System An agreement between the Baltimore City Public School System and the Maryland Transit Administration provides eligible BCPSS students (usually students who live outside a predetermined area surrounding the school) during a school year with a color-coded booklet of dated tickets each month and an identification card. The tickets allow students to ride on MTA buses, light rail, and subway free going to and from school.  The farebox is able to issue magnetic transfers to ticket holders who must use more than one bus.  They're valid for 90 minutes of unlimited travel at the driver's discretion.  MTA college passThe Maryland Transit Administration has a special program set up with 24 Baltimore area colleges and universities which allows college students who are enrolled in a minimum of 6 hours per week can receive a monthly pass for $39.00.  Participating colleges   Anne Arundel Community College Baltimore City Community College Baltimore International College Catonsville Community College Notre Dame of Maryland University Coppin State University Dundalk Community College Essex Community College Harrison Career Institute Johns Hopkins University Homewood Campus School of  Medicine School of  Nursing School of  Public Health School of  Radiology Morgan State University Stevenson University (formerly Villa Julie College) Towson University University of Baltimore University of Maryland, Baltimore University of Maryland, Baltimore County   Police force  The MTA employs its own force of 150 police officers to protect the transit system and its passengers, the Maryland Transit Administration Police. Maryland public transit lawsSection 7-705 of the Maryland Transportation article (Annotated Code of Maryland) enumerates a list of acts specifically prohibited on public transit vehicles, with penalties of fines and possible jail terms for violations. In addition to the enumerated rules of behavior, Section 7-705 also allows the MTA to enforce local government laws on public transit vehicles. Many of these rules are conspicuously posted on transit vehicles, bus stops and rail platforms.

Among many others, it includes the departments of Ancient Studies, History, Music, Political Science, Sociology, and Visual Arts.  Many of the departments will be soon housed in the new Performing Arts and Humanities Building.  Groundbreaking  and a grand opening ceremony for the Performing Arts building was held on September 19, 2012.    Schools  The Erickson School of Aging offers undergraduate and graduate level programs that focuses on various aspects of aging studies, including policy and management issues. The School of Social Work links with the University of Maryland, Baltimore's (UMB) School of Social work in offering undergraduate and graduate level programs.   GPAThe average cumulative GPA of all undergraduates in the Spring 2009 semester was 2.8  Campus  LocationUMBC's campus is located on 500 acres.  It is 15 minutes from Baltimore's Inner Harbor and 45 minutes from Washington, D.C. Baltimore Washington International Airport is five minutes away, as are AMTRAK and light rail stations.  UMBC, three miles outside the Baltimore city limits, successfully lobbied the government to use 'Baltimore' as its address.  While its suburban campus has minimal interaction with its surroundings, students variously consider it to be located in the towns of Catonsville (by CDP) or Arbutus (whose street grid it borders). The campus is undercut by a series of tunnels, which are underground, where tunnels usually are. Research and Technology ParkUMBC Research and Technology Park is a 71 acre development on the campus hosting technology, bioscience and research organizations, many of which are engaged in partnership with the University.     Research Park tenants include the US Geological Survey, US Forestry Service, CardioMed Device Consultants, Audacious Inquiry, Med-IQ, Physician Practice, Inc., Retirement Living TV, Ascentium Corporation, Solvern Innovations, RMF Engineering, Inc., Convergent Technology, Clear Resolution Consulting, Fearless Solutions, and Goddard Earth Science and Technology Center. Campus policeUMBC maintains a 24-hour police staff of sworn officers, supplemented by non-sworn security officers and student marshals.  Unlike the campus police of the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the campus police are not accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.    Accreditation is expected by the University System of Maryland mandated 2013 deadline.   The UMBC police logs all crime reports and statistics as required by law on the UMBC Police Webpage.  Student life The Resident Student Association and Student Events Board provide social programming during all academic semesters at UMBC. Over 200 student-run organizations exist on campus.  There are many squirrels on campus who are not afraid of people. LLC (Language Literacy & Culture)This unique interdisciplinary doctoral program draws upon faculty from disciplines in the humanities and social sciences from eight departments and programs at UMBC: Africana Studies; American Studies; Education; English; History; Gender and Women's Studies; Modern Languages, Linguistics and Intercultural Communication;	and Sociology and Anthropology.  Greek LifeUMBC has 23 officially registered sororities and fraternities with nearly 5% of UMBC's undergraduate students belonging to one of them.

Most international students prefer Potomac Hall because it is always open. (The other dormitories close during Thanksgiving, winter, and spring breaks.)        ChessUMBC has won the Pan American Chess Tournament 9 times in 13 years (1996–2009).  The school provides substantial chess scholarships to outstanding high school graduate players at the International or Grandmaster level.  Former UMBC team captain GM Alexander Onischuk has gone on to become US Champion in 2006.   Professor of Computer Science Alan Sherman has been instrumental in building up the UMBC chess dynasty by recruiting players from around the world. Athletics  The school's sports teams are called the Retrievers, with colors black and gold. The mascot of the University is the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, the state dog of Maryland, named True Grit. There is a statue of True Grit that stands in front of the Retriever Activities Center (RAC). The Retrievers participate in NCAA Division 1 as a part of the America East Conference, fielding 17 varsity sports; eight men and nine women. The Retrievers fight song is the UMBC Riser, and was written by Dr. George LaNoue, a professor of policy sciences.In 2009, the men's lacrosse team secured their fifth consecutive outright or shared America East regular season championship and their third America East tournament championship in four years. UMBC has secured a berth in the NCAA tournament each of the past four seasons.  All-Time Records (PDF), 2009 UMBC Retrievers Men's Lacrosse Media Guide, p. 41–50, UMBC, 2009.  In 2007, the unseeded Retrievers upset seventh-seeded Maryland, 13–9, in the NCAA tournament to advance to the Division I second round for the first, and so far only, time in school history. The Retrievers won their first regular season American East Men's Basketball title in 2007-08, and also qualified for their first NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. They had previously competed in the Division II men's basketball tournament.The Retrievers Men's Soccer Team won the America East Conference in 2010 receiving an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I men's soccer tournament. The Retrievers won their first round game against Princeton but lost in the second round in a shootout to a ranked William and Mary team. This is the best UMBC has ever done at the tournament. Star striker, Levi Houapeu, from that 2010 team was drafted as a 5th pick in the 3rd round of the 2011 MLS Superdraft by the Philadelphia Union. He is the first UMBC player to be drafted into the MLS.  The men also won the conference again in 2012, and advanced to the NCAA tournament once again.  They won their first round game against Old Dominion, but lost in penalty kicks in the second round to defending champion, UNC Chapel Hill.The Retrievers, Men's Swimming and Diving Program captured their 13th straight conference championship in the 2009-2010 Season.  Since Joining the America East Conference in 2004, the Retriever Men have not lost their crown.Retrievers Basketball games are broadcast by Paul Mittermeier and Gary Stein as well as Troy Greene and Dan Levin.In 2010, a contest was launched to find a new logo for Athletics.  In May 2010, the UMBC Athletic Department unveiled a new logo for the Retrievers created by Jim Lord. Financial aid and scholarshipsThe Meyerhoff Scholarship Program at UMBC is a program focused on the cultivation of underrepresented minority scholarship and awareness in the math, science, and engineering disciplines.

The Carnegie Foundation classifies UMBC as a research university with high research activity.  UMBC is one of 50 public institutions in the United States recognized by The Princeton Review as a “Best Value College” offering a combination of educational excellence and affordability.The honor is the third major national distinction UMBC has received from leading higher-education rankings publications this academic year. For the second year in a row, UMBC was named America’s #1 “Up-and-Coming” national university by U.S. News and World Report.The Princeton Review recognizes UMBC, a research university with nearly 13,000 students, for attracting serious students and supporting them with undergraduate research opportunities throughout the Baltimore-Washington region and beyond. The campus location near BWI-Marshall Airport gives students access to internships with government agencies, nonprofits and leading private-sector companies. Approximately 77 percent of students at UMBC receive some financial aid in the form of scholarships, loans and grants.UMBC has earned an honorable mention on The Princeton Review’s recently released list: “Top Schools to Study Video Game Design for 2012.” The recognition places UMBC among schools like Georgia Institute of Technology, UC Santa Cruz, and Northeastern University.Released annually, the list features 50 schools from around the country, including their “top ten” undergraduate and graduate schools in this category. The rankings were based on a survey administered by The Princeton Review during the 2011-2012 academic year that consulted administrators at 150 schools and universities. The winning schools were judged on the quality of their curriculum, faculty, facilities, and infrastructure, as well as their scholarship, financial aid, and career opportunities.Both UMBC’s Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department and its Visual Arts Department offer programs for students interested in pursuing a career in video game development. Artists can concentrate on “Animation and Interactive Media,” while computer programmers can pursue the “Game Development” track within the Computer Science major. In addition, UMBC has a Game Development club, and has been a host site of the International Development Association’s Global Game Jam for the past four years.

Seabrook, Maryland   Seabrook is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George's County, Maryland, about   east of Washington, D.C.  As of the 2010 census, the population of the CDP was 17,287.    Prior to 2010, Seabrook was part of the Lanham-Seabrook census-designated place.  HistorySeabrook takes its name from Thomas Seabrook, who was a topographical engineer with the Pennsylvania Railroad. He originally built three cottages and a park with fenced-in tame deer in the area near the rail station  in the early 1870s. A school was built in 1895.The community developed in direct relationship with the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. The railroad's main branch into Washington opened in July 1872, with stations established at Glenn Dale, Seabrook, and Lanham, among others.  Thomas Seabrook, an engineer for the railroad, purchased   of land in 1871 around the location of a planned station for the purpose of creating a retreat community. By 1880, a station building and three Gothic cottages had been built, followed by commercial buildings and a schoolhouse. By 1914, the community remained small with just a few buildings located at the intersection of Seabrook Road with the railroad. By 1957, the community had grown to include approximately 185 houses along 10 streets. The streets were arranged in a grid pattern roughly parallel to the railroad line. The community extended from present-day Good Luck Road south to Annapolis Road.Residential development continued on vacant lots within the community throughout the 20th century, while commercial development focused along the main roads. Commercial strip development is located along Annapolis Road and Lanham-Severn Road. The original railroad station and early commercial buildings are no longer extant, though the old schoolhouse and a few of the early dwellings survive.    Most of the more recently built Seabrook (some of which was originally called Seabrook Acres) is a development of red brick homes along the Lanham-Severn Road, now Maryland Route 564 in Maryland, approximately one half mile east of the Capital Beltway. Many of its homes were built in the 1950s to serve the needs of new employees at the newly established NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which is located immediately to the north.  Development of apartment complexes and other large structures has occurred during recent years of developer expansion. However, Seabrook remains a residential area with numerous single homes surrounded by green lawns shaded by century old oak trees. GeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Seabrook census-designated place has a total area of  , all land.  BusinessesSeabrook has its own MARC commuter rail station (Seabrook Station). Seabrook residents are served by a large number of small businesses, including restaurants, fast foot eateries, banks, lawyer services, laundry services, veterinary services, car repair, and numerous other businesses which are located at the Seabrook Station. Seabrook shoppers also tend to shop at the supermarkets and stores at Glenn Dale, slightly to the east on Route 564, or drive east approximately   to Bowie, with its large shopping complexes such as the Bowie Towne Centre. Lanham-SeabrookLanham, Maryland, an older community, lies to the west on both sides of the Washington Beltway. Within the Lanham-Seabrook area, there is only one post office (20706), located a half mile east of Seabrook Station on route 564, which both towns must share. As a result, since the post office has been designated "Lanham", all mail to both the Seabrook and Lanham area is town-designated as "Lanham" or "Lanham-Seabrook." References     
St. Mary's City, Maryland  St. Mary's City, in St. Mary's County, Maryland, is a small unincorporated community near the southernmost end of the state on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  It is located on the eastern shore of the St. Mary's River, a tributary of the Potomac. St. Mary's City is the fourth oldest permanent settlement in British North America.  It is considered the birthplace of religious tolerance in the United States, as the colony passed the Maryland Toleration Act (1649). Until 1695 St Mary's City was the capital of the Province of Maryland.A section of the community, Historic St. Mary's City, was declared a National Historic Landmark on August 4, 1969.    and    Note: A National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination document should be available upon request from the National Park Service for this site, but it appears not to be available on-line from the NPS Focus search site.  History BeginningsSt. Mary's City was founded in 1634 by a group of English settlers. They arrived on the ships Dove and Ark.  Leonard Calvert, a Roman Catholic and younger brother of Cecilius Calvert, the 2nd Baron Baltimore, led the group of settlers.  Originally land in the colony was given to their father George Calvert by King Charles I, but the senior Calvert died before the claim was established. The original St. Mary's was laid out according to a Baroque town plan, but most residents of St. Mary's City preferred to live on their tobacco plantations in the surrounding countryside. The settlement was meant to be the capital of the new Maryland Colony. A Yaocomico village had formerly occupied the location, but the Tayac Kittimundiq, paramount chief of the Piscataway nation, ordered the village cleared and gave it to the English newcomers.  He wanted to develop them as allies and trading partners.  For some time, the Piscataway, their tributary tribes, and the English coexisted peacefully. ExpansionIn the second half of the 17th century, St. Mary's City had an economic boom due to successful tobacco farming, which was the most important export commodity.  An increasing town population contributed to the desire for constructing public buildings, some of which were a state house, a Jesuit chapel, a jail, and an inn. During and after the English Civil War, fights between Protestants and Catholics developed in the colonies as well. About forty years later, in 1689, the religious tensions became so great that Protestant settlers revolted against the Lords Baltimore. The English Crown took over the Maryland colony and appointed royal governors. DeclineMaryland governor Sir Francis Nicholson relocated the capital from St. Mary's to the more central Annapolis in 1695.  The colonial statehouse in St. Mary's was turned into a Protestant church the same year.With the seat of government gone, the town lost its reason to exist.  Remaining inhabitants were mostly farmers. The former town center was converted to agricultural land, and archaeological remains from the colonial town were undisturbed in the ground. The smaller farms were consolidated into a large plantation by the Brome-Howard family, which operated through the 19th century.  Much of the historic area remained under a single property owner well into the 20th century. By the mid-20th century, few 17th-century buildings still stood.  The town center site appeared to be farmland with a few private residences, and an expanding school that would become St. Mary's College of Maryland. PresentPresent-day St. Mary's City is primarily the location of St. Mary's College and the Historic St. Mary's City museums. The museum complex is staffed by archaeologists.  It includes a visitor center/museum building, outdoor living history exhibits, reconstructed colonial buildings, the St. John's site museum, and a working 17th-century-style farm. This complex, developed to interpret the site for visitors, was created after Historic St. Mary's was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1969.   and     Archaeological history St. Mary's City is known for its archaeological sites. After explorations by Henry Chandlee Forman in the 1940s, excavations began in 1971  with the creation of the Historic St. Mary's City Commission. The Commission was a state institution tasked with preserving the archaeological remains, establishing a museum on the site, and conducting archaeological research. Since then, much of the old city has been found. Historic St. Mary's City continues to excavate areas of the town today.Some important discoveries include:  A 1645 fort with a surrounding moat, claimed to be the only structural remains of the English Civil War in the American Colonies.  Façon de Venise glassware; A set of Kutahya ceramics, one of only two known examples found in the United States;  Three 17th-century lead coffins; The foundation of a Jesuit chapel; A quantity of lead type, indicating that the site where it was found was the documented William Nuthead Printing House. The print was the first in the Southern Colonies.  St. John's Freehold, where Maryland's citizen government was instituted. Garret Van Sweringen's Inn, a 17th-century inn founded by Garret Van Sweringen, a leader in St. Mary's City's development. 19th-century slave quarters from St. Mary's City's later plantation period. Extensive artifacts from successive Native American occupations; and The 18th-century house of merchant and planter John Hicks, with an extensive ceramic assemblage.

SportsFedEx Field is a football stadium for the Washington Redskins of the NFL in the neighboring CDP of Summerfield. See also Raljon, Maryland.The Prince George's Sports & Learning Complex is located on approximately   adjacent to FedEx Field. Education Public educationLandover is a part of the Prince George's County Public Schools system.  Colleges and universitiesLandover also had career based colleges such as Fortis College   that offers programs including bio-technician, medical assisting, and medical coding and billing. Infrastructure TransportationLandover is one of the few regions in the Washington DC area that is served directly by two separate Washington Metro rail lines.  Landover is served by both the Orange and Blue lines  (Many DC area suburbs are not served directly by Metro rail at all).  The Landover Washington Metro station serves the northern portion of Landover on the Orange Line.  The Garrett Morgan Metro station, constructed in 2004 serves the southern portion of Landover and is the main rail terminus providing access to FedEX feild which is home to the Washington Redskins in addition to many other sporting and entertainment events.  In addition, there are many nearby Washington Metro rail stations in neighborhoods that border Landover including the Addison Road Blue line station in the bordering town of Seat Pleasant, the Cheverly Orange line station in bordering town of Cheverely, the Capital Heights blue line station in bordering town of Captital Heights, the Largo blue line station in bordering unincorporated area of Largo, the Deanwood Orange line station in the District of Columbia.  Most of the above listed stations are within five metro stops or less from the National Capital Building's metro stop (Capital South metro Station in the District of Columbia). I-495/95, the Capital Beltway, crosses U.S. Route 50 in Landover. The Beltway also has junctions with Maryland Route 202 (Landover Road) and Brightseat Road, which leads directly to FedEx Field, the site of Washington Redskins football games. Shopping and Crime   Landover was the home of Landover Mall, owned and operated by Lerner Enterprises.  Built in 1972, it was the first enclosed mall in the Washington, DC metropolitan area to house four high-end retail anchor stores: Garfinkel's, Hecht's (owned by the May company), Woodward and Lothrop (popularly known as Woodies), and Sears.  The mall also housed a multiplex movie theater located in the basement of the northeast corridor of the building.  Located at the Capital Beltway and Landover Road, the mall neighbored the towns of Palmer Park, Ardmore, Glenarden, and Largo.  Palmer Park was the hometown of legendary Olympic boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard.In the late 1980s, crime began to rise in the surrounding areas and frightened shoppers eventually helped fuel the mall's rapid decline.  The movie theater was the first to close, followed by three of the mall's anchor stores in the 1990s.  Garfinkel's closed in 1990, Woodies closed in 1995 and was replaced with a short-lived J. C. Penney store that lasted from 1996 to 2001, and Hecht's closed in 2002 with the opening of the Bowie Town Center located in Bowie. The entire mall officially closed in 2003 and was subsequently demolished in 2006.  Sears remains as the only free standing store.With the arrival of FedEx Field, the home stadium for the Washington Redskins in 1997, the mall's parking lot is used for overflow parking.  In 2007, according to the Washington Post   Prince George's County officials were in the midst of developing plans to transform the area where Landover Mall once stood.  County officials propose to build luxury townhouses, trendy stores, and office buildings.  The goal of the project is to transform the area into a residential and cultural hub that replicates the Bowie Town Center and The Boulevard at the Capital Centre located in Largo. Woodmore Towne Centre, featuring Costco and Wegmans, opened in 2010 in nearby Glenarden. In popular cultureThe documentary short cult classic Heavy Metal Parking Lot (1986) was filmed in Landover in the parking lot of the now-demolished Capital Centre prior to a Judas Priest and Dokken concert.Landover was mentioned in an NCIS series episode.

Carmody Hills, Maryland   Carmody Hills is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County in the State of Maryland in the United States of America.  Because it is not formally incorporated, it has no official boundaries, but the United States Census Bureau has defined a census-designated place consisting of Carmody Hills and the adjacent community of Pepper Mill Village, together designated "Peppermill Village", for statistical purposes. (At the 2000 census the area was delineated as "Carmody Hills-Pepper Mill Village". )  Carmody Hills is located on the south side of Seat Pleasant Drive and east of Seat Pleasant.  HistoryCarmody Hills, platted in the 1930s, is one of several subdivisions constructed in the early to mid 20th century around the Town of Seat Pleasant. Suburban development in this area of Prince George’s County began in the late 19th century and continued to grow throughout the 20th century due to its proximity to Washington and access to the city via railroads, streetcar lines, and road networks. The early 20th-century communities were fostered by the Chesapeake Beach Railway (1898) and the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad (1908). As the popular mode of transportation shifted from streetcar line to the automobile in the 1930s and 1940s, highways gave suburban residents access to the city. The George Palmer Highway (present-day Martin Luther King, Jr. Highway) was constructed on the right-of-way of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad in the early 1940s.    Denny, George D., Jr. Proud Past, Promising Future: Cities and Towns in Prince George's County. Brentwood, Maryland: Tuxedo Press, 1997.  The first development of the Carmody Hills subdivision began in the early 1930s. House construction and road development continued from the 1930s through the 1970s.  By 1942, the community was well established with approximately 130 houses on a grid pattern of nine north-south streets and three east-west streets. In the immediate post-World War II period, vacant lots within the established residential blocks were developed. Between 1957 and 1965, the community expanded one block to the south and several blocks to the east. Also constructed within that time period was the Carmody Hills School. An evaluation of housing conditions in Carmody Hills in the late 1960s found approximately one-third of the houses in need of enhancement. Code enforcement, as well as street paving and drainage, encouraged the construction of new houses in the 1970s in areas of the community previously inaccessible.  References      
Peppermill Village, Maryland   Peppermill Village is an unincorporated community near Maryland Route 214 (Central Avenue), with a majority African-American population, in Prince George's County, Maryland in the United States of America.  The Washington Redskins football stadium, Metrorail's Blue Line, and Hampton Mall shopping center are very near by. Because it is not formally incorporated, it has no official boundaries, but the United States Census Bureau has defined a census-designated place (CDP) consisting of Peppermill Village and the adjacent community of Carmody Hills, for statistical purposes. The population of the CDP was 4,895 at the 2010 census.    For previous censuses, the CDP was named "Carmody Hills-Pepper Mill Village". GeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Peppermill Village had a total area of  , all of it land.  The CDP is bordered to the west and north by the city of Seat Pleasant, to the north and east by the Summerfield CDP, and to the south by the Walker Mill CDP. Peppermill Village is bounded to the south by Maryland Route 214, or Central Avenue, which to the west becomes East Capitol Street in the District of Columbia and to the east connects with the Capital Beltway and the town of Largo.

Oxon Hill, Maryland   Oxon Hill is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in southern Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.  Oxon Hill is a suburb of Washington, D.C., located southeast of the downtown district and east of Alexandria, Virginia. It is adjacent to the new   National Harbor development on the shore of the Potomac River.For the 1990 and 2000 censuses, United States Census Bureau defined a census-designated place consisting of Oxon Hill and the adjacent community of Glassmanor, designated Oxon Hill-Glassmanor, for statistical purposes. As of the 2010 census Oxon Hill was delineated separately and had a population of 17,722.    Geography  Oxon Hill is located in Prince George's County, Maryland along Maryland Route 210 (Indian Head Highway) and Maryland Route 414 (Oxon Hill Road), less than   south of the boundary of Washington, D.C. The CDP lies directly south of the Capital Beltway (I-495/I-95) just east of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total area of Oxon Hill is  , of which   is land and  , or 0.20%, is water.  History Oxon Hill was named for the colonial 18th century manor home of Thomas Addison (which burned in 1895 but was replaced in 1929 by a large 49-room neo-Georgian-style home called Oxon Hill Manor, standing on a bluff over the Potomac River). The current Manor is now owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and is used for cultural activities, as well as being rented for weddings and special events (it reopened in Oct. 2007 after repairs). "Oxon" is an abbreviation for the Latin Oxoniensis, meaning "of Oxford."  The area now known as Oxon Hill reminded Addison of the area near Oxford, England.  The Revolutionary patriot John Hanson died while visiting the first Manor, and may be buried there in an unmarked grave.Oxon Hill Manor, the Butler House, Oxon Cove Park, and St. Ignatius Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.   Today the community is bisected by the busy Capital Beltway (I-95/495), and is near the interstate Woodrow Wilson Bridge. The enlarged bridge was opened December 15, 2008, and highway interchanges and ramps near the bridge were also re-aligned and re-configured. Prior to that date, traffic backed up into Oxon Hill daily for decades as 250,000-300,000 vehicles crossed the Wilson Bridge. (Thousands of white-collar commuters working in Northern Virginia's booming economy find that housing is cheaper in Prince George's County, Maryland.) Oxon Hill includes many garden apartment and townhouse communities along with single-family detached homes built mostly between the 1940s when suburban development began, through the early 1990s (except for the newer National Harbour condominiums), including the incorporated town Forest Heights. In earlier decades, many residents were scientists from the adjacent U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Air Force personnel, or musicians in military bands, but very few are now, as today such professionals prefer newer and more upscale communities.  Oxon Hill's two principal shopping centers ("Rivertowne", built about 1985 which includes a K-Mart, Safeway, Staples, Old Navy and Home Depot, and "Eastover", built about 1955) attract neighborhood customers as well as shoppers from nearby Southeast Washington, D.C. Eastover, located at the D.C./state line, is a hub of many bus routes, some of them operating 24 hours a day, and has a Prince George's County Police station. The apartment communities closest to the D.C. line are informally called by their original name "Glassmanor", although rental companies have officially given them newer names.  Rather unusual community features are a nursing home and a large cultural center, both operated for an ethnic Filipino population who are numerous in Oxon Hill and Fort Washington.  A Walmart is scheduled to open in 2013. Until about 1960, the community used the mailing address Washington, D.C., before getting its own postal designation. About 1980, the United States Postal Service detached the two-thirds of greater Oxon Hill that was furthest from Washington, D.C. and re-defined that part as a new postal designation, Fort Washington, MD. To make mail sorting easier at that time, the new postal boundary line separating the two Maryland communities was drawn along already existing zip code boundaries. (The former zip 20021 portion of Oxon Hill remained Oxon Hill with the new code 20745, while everything in the former zip 20022 portion of Oxon Hill about 1980 was automatically renamed the new Fort Washington 20744.) Illogically, this partitioning re-assigned some areas that seem to be almost in the heart of Oxon Hill (such as all of the Bock Road, Tucker Road, Murray Hills, and Brinkley Road areas, including several large prominent churches, Rosecroft Raceway, the ice rink, and ironically even Oxon Hill Middle School) to Fort Washington mailing addresses, which can cause confusion. Educational institutions Oxon Hill has many schools, including the very large Oxon Hill High School, part of the Prince George's County public school system; the school has a magnet science and technology program; it is being completely replaced by a new facility scheduled to open in August 2013.   Other students attend Potomac, Friendly, or Crossland high schools. Another magnet school in Oxon Hill is the K-8 John Hanson French Immersion School whose mission is to ensure that all students acquire knowledge and skills, through speaking, reading and writing the French language. The French Immersion school is also attached to the John Hanson Montessori School which upholds the teaching ideals of Italian educator Maria Montessori. Both are located in the former John Hanson Junior High School building, which is next door to the main Oxon Hill post office.The town has a very large, modern public library, completely remodeled in 2005,  part of the Prince George's public library system. Originally built in 1967,  the Oxon Hill Library Branch contains the Sojourner Truth Room, an African American research collection. This comprehensive collection of reference materials on African American history and culture includes over 16,000 cataloged items (many are rare or out-of-print), periodicals, sheet music by African American composers, pictures and posters. Vertical files contain pamphlets, clippings and bibliographies. Copies of selected materials are also in the Oxon Hill Branch's circulating collection. An extensive collection of current and historical periodicals, including the NAACP's Crisis from 1910, the Journal of Negro History from 1916 and Ebony from 1945.The collection includes original editions of some slave narratives, as well as many reprint editions and the thirty-one volume Writer's Project series. Other topics are antislavery and slavery tracts, literary criticism, and the history of African Americans in Maryland and Prince George's County. Outdoor recreation Rosecroft Raceway (founded in 1949) and Henson Creek Golf Course are among Oxon Hill's recreational attractions, although in 2008 Rosecroft ended live harness horse racing and now only offers betting on televised simulcast races (per article in Washington Post, May 20, 2010). (The Maryland slot machine referendum in November 2008 did not include Rosecroft in its list of possible sites to add slots.) Rosecroft Raceway closed June 19, 2010. The Parks Commission's 1974 Tucker Road ice skating rink, at the Tucker Road Athletic Complex, was enclosed and expanded to year-round use in 2005;  across from it is the Tucker Road Community Center and nearby is a private club swimming pool, the Oxon Hill Recreation Club (OHRC). OHRC has been in continuous operation since 1958.  A 37,000 square foot gymnasium and recreation and learning center (Tech Rec Center) is scheduled to open in 2013, on Bock Road.   The Henson Creek paved hiker-biker trail extends   along a stream. Oxon Cove Farm (formerly Oxon Hill Children's Farm) is a free of charge, educational facility operated daily for families by the National Park Service. Its future is uncertain because it is located in the shadow of National Harbor. The farm also has a bicycle trail used by a few commuters to nearby government facilities. General public indoor and outdoor swimming pools are also on Allentown Road near Padgett's Corner.Oxon Hill is the entryway to National Harbor, a major development on the Potomac River: a   mixed-use community including 2,500 residential units, 4,000 hotel rooms, a convention center,   of retail, dining, and entertainment, and   of class-"A" office space, along with the largest marina on the Potomac River and the largest hotel in the entire Washington area.

Glassmanor, Maryland   Glassmanor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Prince George's County, Maryland, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 17,295.    Prior to 2010, the United States Census Bureau had placed Glassmanor and the adjacent community of Oxon Hill in the "Oxon Hill-Glassmanor" census-designated place for statistical purposes.The original Glassmanor apartments were built about 1950 by the Glassman company just outside the border of southeast Washington, D.C.  In the mid-1950s the Eastover shopping center was built across the highway, followed by other adjoining apartment projects in the 1960s. U.S. Senator George McGovern, who was the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in 1972, lived briefly in Glassmanor while a freshman congressman   The area has undergone tremendous demographic and social changes since that time.

Capital punishment in Maryland Capital punishment is a legal form of judicial punishment in the U.S. state of Maryland. It has been in use in the state — or more precisely, its predecessor colony — since June 20, 1638, when two men were hanged for piracy in St. Mary's County. A total of 309 people were executed by a variety of methods from 1638 to June 9, 1961, the last execution before Furman v. Georgia. Since that time, five people have been executed. Executions in Maryland are currently suspended as a result of a court case until the procedures used to perform the execution are approved using the process required by state law. HistoryUp until the second half the 20th century, most executions were by hanging. The exceptions were a soldier shot for desertion, two slaves hanged in chains, and one female slave who was burned at the stake. All hangings were performed in public in the county where the offence took place. In 1809, the Maryland legislature enacted laws that provided for murder in varying degrees. The mandatory punishment for first-degree murder was given as death. New laws came into force in 1908 which allowed the sentencing judge discretion, giving the option of life imprisonment. Then in 1916, the jury was given the option of deciding if they wished to impose the death penalty during their deliberations. They could now return a sentence of guilty "without capital punishment."This changed under new state laws in 1922, which required all hangings to be executed at the Metropolitan Transition Center (formerly known as the Maryland State Penitentiary) in Baltimore. It was designed to get rid of "the curious mobs that frequent hangings taking place in the counties of this State, and who attempt to make public affairs of the same." 75 men were hanged on the Penitentiary gallows. Of these, 12 hangings were double hangings and on two occasions triple hangings took place. The first indoor hanging in the state, would come before this time though, with an execution on 3 January 1913 in the Baltimore City Jail, which only had invited guests present.There is one known instance of a botched execution by hanging. On 30 January 1930, Jack Johnson stood on the trapdoor after being convicted of a double murder. But as he fell through, the rope snapped and he fell to the ground below. He was left badly injured and carried to the top of the gallows on a stretcher. There, a new rope was placed around his neck and he was hanged, supported by a stretcher. The Maryland government decided in 1955 to change the method of execution to the use of lethal gas in the gas chamber. A total of four men were executed in this fashion. The first was on 28 June 1957.  During the 20th century number of convicts were also executed for rape.  Constitutional challengesAfter the Furman v. Georgia decision of the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that death penalty statutes were unconstitutionally arbitrary in their application, the Maryland legislature removed all arbitrariness by making death the mandatory punishment for first-degree murder once again. Such laws were found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional in Woodson v. North Carolina. As such, the Maryland legislature took the route which the Supreme Court had found acceptable in Gregg v. Georgia and introduced bifurcated trials, where the jury first decided guilt and then punishment, mandatory appellate review, and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.    Further laws changes in 1987 and 1989 excluded juveniles and the mentally retarded from execution.The first person to be sentenced to death under Maryland's current statute was Richard Danny Tichnell, who was found guilty of murdering Garrett County Sheriff's Deputy David Livengood in 1979. Tichnell's sentence was overturned on appeal, as were two successive death sentences that prosecutors won against him. A fourth jury declined to impose the death penalty, and Tichnell died in 2006 of natural causes while serving a life sentence.  In 1994, the method was changed to lethal injection for persons convicted after March 25, 1994.  For person sentenced before 25 March 1994, the condemned is given the choice between the gas chamber and lethal injection. John Thanos was put to death using lethal injection on 16 May 1994. This was the first execution in Maryland in over 30 years.Governor Parris N. Glendening halted executions in Maryland by executive order on 9 May 2002, while a state-ordered University of Maryland, College Park study of capital punishment was conducted.  The study eventually concluded that there are racial and geographic disparities in the application of the death penalty in the state, but the subsequent governor, Robert Ehrlich, ended the moratorium and resumed executions in 2004.  Administrative law challengeIn 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals in Evans v. Maryland ruled that state executions would be suspended because the manual that spells out the protocol for lethal injections was not adopted using the process required by the state Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Evans v. Maryland, 396 Md. 256, 914 A.2d 25 (2006).  The state APA requires state administrative agencies to adopt regulations, which are defined as statements that have general application and are adopted by an agency to detail or carry out a law that the agency administers, using a process that includes a review by the Attorney General, review by a legislative committee, and publication for public notice and comment. The state's Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services had adopted the manual without following any of these activities. The Court of Appeals noted that the procedures for execution in the manual were clearly regulations, and because they had not been properly adopted, they could not be used until they had been either adopted as required by the APA or the state law was changed.  The ruling in Evans, while not significant from an administrative law aspect as it was consistent with state case law, will prevent executions until the agreement is reached regarding both the need for the death penalty and in the method and procedure to be used to carry it out. The Maryland General Assembly in 2008 has established the Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment to provide recommendations concerning the application and administration of capital punishment in the state so that they are free from bias and error and achieve fairness and accuracy.  Following a series of public hearings, the Commission on November 12, 2008, voted 13-7 to recommend that the General Assembly repeal the capital punishment statutes as carries the real possibility of execution of innocent persons and may be biased against African Americans.  The Commission submitted its final report, along with a minority report, to the General Assembly dated December 12, 2008 which "strongly recommends that capital punishment be abolished in Maryland." On 6 March 2013, the Maryland State Senate voted 27-20 in favour of SB 276, a bill to repeal the death penalty  . This was followed by floor debates in the House of Delegates, and a vote on the bill may come as early as 15 March 2013. On 15 March 2013 the House approved the legislation by a 82-56 vote and sent the bill to the Governor who will sign it. So with this action, Maryland will become the 18th state in the US to ban the death penalty . Current state lawOnly first degree murder is a capital offense in the state of Maryland. Criminal Law § 2-201 of the Annotated Code of Maryland defines murder in the first degree as:  A deliberate, premeditated, and willful killing. Committed by lying in wait. Committed by poison. Committed in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate arson, burglary, carjacking, escape from prison, kidnapping, mayhem, rape, robbery, sexual offense, sodomy, or bomb-making. If the offender willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation intended the death of a law enforcement officer.  The state's attorney in a case involving a capital punishment eligible crime must give the defendant notice at least thirty days prior to the trial that the death penalty will be sought and the aggravating circumstances that the state will present to the jury. Under Criminal Law § 2-303, the sentence of death is imposed:  "…by intravenous administration of a lethal quantity of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate or other similar drug in combination with a chemical paralytic agent."  The lethal injection procedure used in Maryland consists of the anesthetic drug sodium pentothal, followed by the paralytic drug pancuronium bromide, which is also known as Pavulon, and lastly a drug which stops the heart, potassium chloride.  The execution is completed when, using an electrocardiogram, a physician declares the convict to be dead. Unlike most states, Maryland does not offer the condemned a special last meal; instead the prisoner receives whatever food the general prison population is served the day of the convict's death.As in any other state, people who are under 18 at the time of commission of the capital crime  or mentally retarded  are constitutionally precluded from being executed. Post-Gregg executionsA total of 5 individuals convicted of murder have been executed by the state of Maryland since 1976. All were executed by lethal injection.   !Executed person Date of execution Victim(s) Under Governor  1 John Frederick Thanos May 16, 1994 Billy Winebrenner, Gregory Allen Taylor, and Melody Pistorio William Donald Schaefer  2 Flint Gregory Hunt July 2, 1997 Vincent Adolfo Parris Glendening  3 Tyrone Delano Gilliam, Jr. November 16, 1998 Christine Doerfler  4 Steven Howard Oken June 17, 2004 Dawn Marie Garvin, Patricia Hirt, Lori Ward Robert Ehrlich  5 Wesley Eugene Baker December 5, 2005 Jane Tyson   Current Death Row Inmates5 men are currently sentenced to death in Maryland who are housed at the North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax facility located near Cumberland.   !Inmate Date of crime Victim(s)  1 John Booth-El May 20, 1983 Rose and Irvin Bronstein  2 Vernon Lee Evans April 28, 1983 David Scott Piechowicz and Susan Kennedy  3 Anthony Grandison April 28, 1983 David Scott Piechowicz and Susan Kennedy  4 Heath William Burch March 19, 1995 Robert and Cleo Davis  5 Jody Lee Miles April 2, 1997 Edward J.

List of United States Senators from Maryland This is a List of United States Senators from Maryland. Maryland ratified the Constitution on April 28, 1788, becoming the seventh state to do so.  To provide for continuity of government, the framers divided Senators into staggered classes that serve six-year terms, and Maryland's Senators are in the first and third classes.  Before the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which allowed for direct election of Senators, Maryland's Senators were chosen by the Maryland General Assembly. Until the assembly appointed George L. Wellington of Cumberland in 1897, Senators in class 3 were chosen from the Eastern Shore while Senators in class 1 were chosen from the remainder of the state.  Class 1Class 1 U.S. Senators belong to the electoral cycle that were elected for one session of the U.S. Congress in the first election of 1788 and whose seats in recent years are contested in 1994, 2000, 2006, and 2012.  # Senator Party Years Congress Term Electoral history   1  Charles Carroll Pro- Administration March 4, 1789 – November 30, 1792 1 1 Elected in 1789  2 2 Re-elected in 1791  Resigned to remain in the Maryland Senate   Vacant November 30, 1792 – January 10, 1793   2  Richard Potts Pro- Administration January 10, 1793 – October 24, 1796 2  (Continued)  Elected to finish Carroll's term  Resigned  3  4   Vacant October 24, 1796 – November 30, 1796   3  John Eager Howard Federalist November 30, 1796 – March 3, 1803 4  (Continued)  Elected to finish Potts's term  5 3 Re-elected in 1796     6  7   4  Samuel Smith Democratic-Republican March 4, 1803 – March 3, 1815 8 4 Elected in 1803  9  10  11 5 Re-elected in 1809     12  13   Vacant March 4, 1815 – February 4, 1816 14 6 Legislature failed to elect   5  Robert Goodloe Harper Federalist February 5, 1816 – December 6, 1816 Elected late in 1815      Vacant December 6, 1816 – December 20, 1816   6  Alexander Contee Hanson Federalist December 20, 1816 – April 23, 1819 14  (Continued)  Elected to finish Harper's term  Died  15  16   Vacant April 23, 1819 – December 21, 1819   7  William Pinkney Democratic-Republican December 21, 1819 – February 25, 1822 16  (Continued)  Elected to finish Hanson's term  17 7 Re-elected in 1821  Died   Vacant February 25, 1822 – December 17, 1822   8  Samuel Smith Democratic-Republican December 17, 1822 – March 3, 1833 17  (Continued)  Elected to finish Pinkney's term  Crawford Republican 18  Jacksonian 19  20 8 Re-elected in 1827  21  22   9  Joseph Kent Anti- Jacksonian March 4, 1833 – November 24, 1837 23 9 Elected in 1833  Died  24  Whig 25   Vacant November 24, 1837 – January 4, 1838   10 William Duhurst Merrick Whig January 4, 1838 – March 3, 1845 25  (Continued)  Elected to finish Kent's term  26 10 Re-elected in 1839  27  28   11  Reverdy Johnson Whig March 4, 1845 – March 7, 1849 29 11 Elected in 1845  Resigned to become U.S. Attorney General  30  31   Vacant March 7, 1849 – December 6, 1849   12  David Stewart Whig December 6, 1849 – January 12, 1850 Appointed to continue Johnson's term  Retired when successor elected   13  Thomas Pratt Whig January 12, 1850 – March 3, 1857 Elected to finish Johnson's term  32 12 Re-elected in 1851  33  34   14  Anthony Kennedy American March 4, 1857 – March 3, 1863 35 13 Elected in 1857  36  37   15  Reverdy Johnson Unionist/ Democratic March 4, 1863 – July 10, 1868 38 14 Elected in 1863  Resigned to become Ambassador to England  39  40   Vacant July 10, 1868 – July 13, 1868   16  William Pinkney Whyte Democratic July 13, 1868 – March 3, 1869 40  (Continued)  Appointed to finish Johnson's term  Retired   17  William Thomas Hamilton Democratic March 4, 1869 – March 3, 1875 41 15 Elected in 1869  Retired to run for Governor  42  43   18  William Pinkney Whyte Democratic March 4, 1875 – March 3, 1881 44 16 Elected in 1875  Lost re-election  45  46   19  Arthur Pue Gorman Democratic March 4, 1881 – March 3, 1899 47 17 Elected in 1881  48  49  50 18 Re-elected in 1887  51  52  53 19 Elected in 1893  Lost re-election  54  55   20  Louis E.

Maryland state legislature 
Maryland General Assembly  The Maryland General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland. It is a bicameral body. The upper chamber, the Maryland State Senate, has 47 representatives and the lower chamber, the Maryland House of Delegates, has 141 representatives. The General Assembly meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2,300 bills including the State's annual budget, which it must pass before adjourning. The 428th Session began on January 13, 2011 and adjourned on April 12. Like the Governor, members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.The Maryland General Assembly convenes within the State House in Annapolis. HistoryThe forerunner of the Maryland General Assembly was the colonial institution, an assembly of free Marylanders, which bore the same name. Maryland's foundational charter created a state ruled by the Palatine lord, Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter, and possessed absolute authority over his domain.However, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the House of Commons of England. Andrews, p.70  An act was passed providing that:  "from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly...together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them...shall think good". In addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he desired. In some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that "assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least", ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.  During the American Revolution the colonial Assembly ceased to exist, and was replaced by its modern successor. Qualifications and membershipEach senator or delegate must be a citizen of Maryland and a resident of the state for at least one year preceding his or her election. A prospective legislator must have resided for the six months prior to election in the legislative district the candidate seeks to represent. A senator must be at least twenty-five years of age at the time of election and a delegate at least twenty-one. Persons elected to or holding a civil or military office other than as a member of a reserve component under the federal or State government are not eligible for election to the General Assembly.Each term lasts four years. However, members of the General Assembly are not term limited. If a vacancy occurs in either house through death, resignation, or disqualification, the Governor appoints a replacement whose name is submitted by the State Central Committee of the same political party as the legislator whose seat is to be filled. Legislative districts The current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial U.S. Census. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. In most districts, the three delegates are elected at large from the whole district via block voting. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state, the districts are divided into subdistricts for the election of delegates: either into three one-delegate subdistricts or one two-delegate subdistrict and one one-delegate subdistrict. LeadershipThe Senate is led by a President and the House by a Speaker whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders. Overview of legislative procedureA bill is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. A House Bill (HB) is one introduced in the House of Delegates (for example: HB 6);  a Senate Bill (SB), in the Senate.Bills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, HB 16 refers to the sixteenth bill introduced in the House of Delegates. The numbering starts afresh each session. The names of the sponsor (and co-sponsors, if any), the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title. Bills listed as "The Speaker (By Request of Administration)", "The President (By Request of Administration)", "Minority Leader (By Request of Administration)", or "Committee Chair (By Request of Department)" are bills proposed by the Governor and his agencies and are not proposals of the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader, or the respective Committee Chair. They are listed with the official title of a legislator rather than the Governor due to requirements in the Maryland Constitution. The legislative procedure, is divided into distinct stages:  . The procedure begins when a Senator or Delegate decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the Department of Legislative Reference's bill drafting division, where it is drafted into bill form. The draft of the bill is returned to the legislator for introduction. Introduction or First Reading. A bill is introduced or read the first time when the bill number, the name of the sponsor, and the descriptive title of the bill are read on the floor of the house. Committee hearing. After introduction, a bill is assigned to the appropriate policy committee, appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. Notice of the hearing is published in the Maryland Register to allow for public comment. During the committee hearing the sponsor presents the bill to the committee, and testimony may be heard in support or opposition to the bill from any member of the public. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership for a bill to be passed and sent to the next committee or to the floor. Second reading. A bill recommended for passage by committee is read a second time on the floor of the house. Legislators, not on the committee where the bill received its public hearing, may only offer amendments to the bill at this stage. House bills in the Senate may be amended by Senators on second or third reading and Senate bills in the House may also be amended on second or third reading. After all amendments are considered, the presiding officer orders the bill to be printed for third reading. This printing would include any committee or floor amendments. Third reading. A roll call vote is taken. An ordinary bill needs a majority vote to pass. An emergency bill requires a two-thirds vote, a bill requiring the Maryland Constitution to be amended requires a three-fifths vote. Second house. If the bill receives a constitutional majority from the first house, the bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor's desk. Resolution of Differences (concurrence or conference). If a measure is amended in the second house and passed, it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may concur with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house conference committee. Appointed by the Senate President and the House Speaker, a conference committee consists of three members of each house. The committee sends a report of its recommendations to each chamber which then can adopt or reject it. If the report is adopted, the bill is voted upon for final passage in each house. If the report is rejected by either house, the bill fails.    Governor's action. All passed bills, except the budget bill and constitutional amendments, must be presented to the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may veto bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election. Veto overrides. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor's veto; a three-fifths vote of both houses is required to override a veto. Effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the Secretary of State. These chaptered bills are statutes, and ordinarily become part of Maryland law. Ordinarily a law passed during a regular session takes effect October 1 of the same year. Emergency bills go into effect as soon as the governor signs them; these include acts calling for special elections and emergency measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.

Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland  Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, 23rd Proprietary Governor of Maryland (c. 1741 – 2 September 1784) was a British colonial official and the last Royal Governor of Maryland. Although a popular governor and an able administrator, Eden's authority was overthrown by the events of the American Revolution, and in June 1776 he was invited by the Maryland Convention to leave for England. Eden was well-regarded at home and in the same year, 1776, he was made a baronet. He eventually returned to Maryland where he died in 1784 at the age of 43. He was buried in Annapolis and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Frederick, a noted author. Early lifeEden was born in Durham, England, on 14 September 1741, Eden at www.findagrave.com Retrieved January 2011  the second son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of West Auckland, and the brother of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley and a relative of North Carolina Governor Charles Eden. CareerIn 1763 Eden made an advantageous marriage, wedding the Hon. Caroline Calvert, daughter of Maryland's proprietor Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. In 1766 Caroline bore a son, Frederick. Three years later, in 1769, aged just 28, Robert Eden succeeded Horatio Sharpe as Governor of Maryland, the highest office in the Province. As Governor, Eden would attempt to maintain authority over the increasingly rebellious Province during the tumultuous years preceding the American Revolution.  Maryland and the American War of Independence  Eden was not among those who believed that coercion would force Marylanders into loyalty to the mother country. During the 1770s opposition to British taxation grew, and the Governor's authority began to falter. On April 19, 1774 Eden was forced to prorogue the Colonial Assembly, the last occasion on which it would convene.   From this point on the government of Maryland was increasingly in the hands of the Revolutionaries. On October 19, 1774 the Peggy Stewart was burned in Annapolis harbour in protest against taxes on tea, in imitation of the famous Boston Tea Party, which took place on December 16, 1773.   On December 30, 1774 Eden wrote:  "The spirit of resistance against the Tea Act, or any mode of internal taxation, is as strong and universal here as ever. I firmly believe that they will undergo any hardship sooner than acknowledge a right in the British Parliament in that particular, and will persevere in their non-importation and non-exportation experiments, in spite of every inconvenience that they must consequently be exposed to, and the total loss of their trade."   Although Eden had some sympathy with the colonists' grievances, he was firmly opposed to armed opposition to the Crown. In the event, Maryland was the only state that did not forcibly eject its last proprietary governor from office, choosing instead a formal and largely courteous transfer of power. By 1775 Eden's authority had been effectively usurped by the Annapolis Convention and Eden was eventually asked by the Maryland Council of Safety to step down as governor. The Maryland Convention had been pressed by the Continental Congress (and the Virginians in particular) to arrest and detain Eden but they demurred, preferring to avoid such an "extreme" measure. Instead they argued that:  "This Convention, and the Council of Safety for the time being, were the only proper and adequate judges of the propriety and expediency of suffering Governor Eden to depart out of this Province, and have proceeded in that matter upon evidence which was satisfactory to themselves, and to which the convention of Virginia were strangers" Andrews, p.317   Eventually the Maryland Convention formally asked the Governor to leave, and Governor Eden finally departed Maryland for England in the ship Fowey on June 23, 1776,.  He was created a baronet, of Maryland in North America, in 1776. Family life In 1763 Eden married Caroline Calvert, daughter of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore,  and in 1769 he succeeded Governor Horatio Sharpe as Governor of Maryland. Caroline was half-sister to Benedict Swingate Calvert, a Judge of the Land office with whom Eden shared a love of horse racing.

Glenmont, Maryland   Glenmont is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. The U.S. Census Bureau combines Glenmont with nearby Wheaton to create the Census Designated Place of Wheaton-Glenmont. Location Due to its unincorporated nature, the boundaries are difficult to precisely define, but the center of the community is located at the intersection of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue (Maryland State Highway 97). TransportationGlenmont is a suburban crossroads of sorts. Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97) passes through the community. Southbound along Georgia Avenue is Wheaton, downtown Silver Spring, and the District of Columbia. North of Glenmont on Georgia Avenue is Aspen Hill (another unincorporated community) and Leisure World, a large retirement community. Route 97 continues north through Howard and Carroll counties to Pennsylvania.Meeting Georgia Avenue at the heart of Glenmont is Randolph Road. The intersection of Georgia Avenue and Randolph Road is heavily congested, and there are plans to replace the current, at-grade intersection with a grade-separated interchange. Georgia Avenue is under study as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route in the Countywide Transit Corridors Functional Master Plan. The State Highway Administration is also studying BRT along Georgia Avenue between Glenmont and Olney.Layhill Road (Maryland Route 182) has its southern terminus at Georgia Avenue, just north of Randolph Road.The Glenmont Metro station serves the area.   This underground station, which opened in 1998, is at the east end of the Red Line, and has a large parking garage.  From Glenmont, the Red Line heads south to downtown Silver Spring and to the District of Columbia before re-entering Montgomery County and terminating at Shady Grove.  Public safetyThe Kensington Volunteer Fire Department has a fire station at the intersection of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue.  Montgomery County Police District 4 headquarters is also located at the intersection.  The Maryland-National Capital Park Police has its headquarters in an old elementary school on Layhill Road. ShoppingThere is a large shopping center on the northeast corner of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue. It has a supermarket, pharmacy, office supply store, one gasoline service station, local pub, convenience store, barber shop, sporting goods store, numerous small markets and restaurants, and a branch office of the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. There are also other restaurants and stores scattered along Georgia Avenue. HousingThere are three large garden apartment complexes and a condominium at the heart of Glenmont. The rest of the area consists of single family homes and a few townhouses. Most of the housing stock west of Georgia Avenue is older and smaller; east of Georgia Avenue, the homes are newer and larger. However, there are a few sites west of Georgia Avenue where homeowners have demolished small, older homes and built larger, newer ones in their place. Nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of the area's housing units are owner-occupied, though this is less than the countywide homeownership rate of 75 percent. EducationTwo public high schools (John F. Kennedy High School and Wheaton High School) serve Glenmont. There is at least one elementary school, Glenallan, in the community. Not far from the unofficial boundary with Aspen Hill, but inside the area commonly considered to be part of Glenmont (3100 Regina Drive), can be found the community's other elementary school, Georgian Forest. There is also Highland Elementary School. Terrain The area consists of modest rolling hills broken by small streams, all of them fed mainly by run-off from storm drainage, although the community contains at least one natural spring still producing acquifer-fed water. All streams to the east side of Glenmont are part of the Anacostia River watershed; they flow into the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia, which empties into the Potomac. Streams to the west of Glenmont generally reach the Potomac by way of Rock Creek, with Georgia Avenue serving as a rough dividing line between the two drainage areas. Civic Association In October 2008, the Greater Glenmont Civic Association (GGCA)   was founded to address rising crime rates in Glenmont, and to encourage the Montgomery County government to re-vitalize the Glenmont area, just as the county had done in the neighboring Wheaton and Silver Spring areas.  According to GGCA documents, crime has been reduced in the Glenmont area by about 15% as of June, 2010.  The GGCA has won several awards and grants for its activities.

Interstate 795 (Maryland)   Interstate 795 (I-795), also known as the Northwest Expressway, is a nine-mile (14 km) freeway linking Baltimore's northwestern suburbs of Pikesville, Owings Mills and Reisterstown, Maryland to the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695).  The route bypasses Maryland Route 140 (MD 140), Reisterstown Road), carrying part of the Baltimore Metro Subway in its median for a four-mile stretch, and provides direct access to Owings Mills Mall.  It never connects to its parent, I-95, except via I-695. Route description I-795 begins in Pikesville at a directional T interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway), which heads south toward Glen Burnie and east toward Towson. I-695 provides access to I-95 in the directions of Washington and New York and to highways into Baltimore. Immediately to the east of the interchange is the Old Court station of the Baltimore Metro Subway, which passes through the interchange and settles into the median of the six-lane freeway as they cross Gwynns Falls. I-795 parallels and has two crossings of CSX Transportation's Hanover Subdivision as the freeway and transit line head northwest. The subway line ends just north of its and the highway's second crossing of Gwynns Falls at the terminal Owings Mills station.  Immediately to the northwest of the subway terminus is I-795's interchange with Owings Mills Boulevard (unsigned MD 940), which is a partial cloverleaf interchange with flyover ramps from northbound I-795 to southbound Owings Mills Boulevard and from the southbound boulevard to the southbound Interstate. The interchange also features direct ramps with Owings Mills Town Center to and from the direction of Baltimore and direct ramps with the subway station to and from the direction of Reisterstown. I-795 continues northwest as a four-lane freeway. The highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Franklin Boulevard before reaching its northern terminus at MD 140 on the edge of Reisterstown. The terminus consists of direct ramps with MD 140 to and from the direction of Westminster and an intersection with MD 140 (Westminster Pike) and MD 795, an unnamed and unsigned connector between the intersection and an intersection with MD 30 and MD 128 on the north side of Reisterstown.   HistoryThe Northwest Expressway was one of the first freeways planned for construction in the state of Maryland. The first four-mile (6 km) section to the Owings Mills exit was completed in 1985; the remaining five miles (8 km) were completed in 1987.The original plan was for the highway to run into the City of Baltimore along a similar route to that of the Metro Subway. Plans to extend the highway beyond its current configuration have not been sought out by highway officials in Maryland. This alignment would most likely have terminated at Wabash Avenue, which parallels the elevated section of the Metro Subway.

Carrollton, Maryland  Carrollton is a locality in Carroll County, Maryland, USA.  It is not to be confused with Carrollton Manor in Frederick County, from which Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a prominent signer of the Declaration of Independence, took his name. It also should not be confused with New Carrollton, MD which is located in Prince George's County. New Carrollton, a Washington suburb created in the 1950s, was originally also called "Carrollton, Maryland," until a name change occurred in 1966.      
Province of Maryland    The Province of Maryland was an English and later British colony in North America that existed from 1632 until 1776, when it joined the other twelve of the Thirteen Colonies in rebellion against Great Britain and became the U.S. state of Maryland. The province began as a proprietary colony of the English Lord Baltimore, who wished to create a haven for English Catholics in the new world at the time of the European wars of religion. Although Maryland was an early pioneer of religious toleration in the English colonies, religious strife among Anglicans, Puritans, Catholics, and Quakers was common in the early years, and Puritan rebels briefly seized control of the province. In 1689, the year following the Glorious Revolution, John Coode led a Protestant rebellion that expelled Lord Baltimore from power in Maryland. Power in the colony was restored to the family in 1715 when Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, swore publicly that he was a Protestant.Despite early competition with the colony of Virginia to its south, and the Dutch colony of New Netherland to its north, the Province of Maryland developed along very similar lines to Virginia. Its early settlements and populations centers tended to cluster around the rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay and, like Virginia, Maryland's economy quickly became centered around the farming of tobacco for sale in Europe. The need for cheap labor, and later with the mixed farming economy that developed when tobacco prices collapsed, led to a rapid expansion of indentured servitude and, later, forcible immigration and enslavement of Africans.The Province of Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution, and echoed events in New England by establishing committees of correspondence and hosting its own tea party similar to the one that took place in Boston. By 1776 the old order had been overthrown, as Marylanders signed the Declaration of Independence, forcing the end of British colonial rule. 17th Century origins  Founding charter On June 20, 1632 Charles I of England granted the original charter for Maryland, a proprietary colony of about twelve million acres (49,000 km²), to Cæcilius Calvert (Cecil), 2nd Baron Baltimore in the Peerage of Ireland. Some historians view this grant as a form of compensation for Calvert's father's having been stripped of his title of Secretary of State upon announcing his Roman Catholicism in 1625. The charter had originally been granted to Calvert's father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, but the 1st Baron Baltimore died before it could be executed, so it was granted to his son in his place.    Whatever the reason for granting the colony specifically to Baltimore, however, the King had very practical reasons to create a colony north of the Potomac in 1632.  The colony of New Netherland set up by England's great Imperial rival in this era, the United Provinces specifically claimed the Delaware River valley and was vague about its border with Virginia.  Charles rejected all the Dutch claims on the Atlantic seaboard, but was anxious to bolster English claims by formally occupying the territory.  The new colony was named after the devoutly Catholic Henrietta Maria, the Queen Consort.   The Lords Baltimore were the only Catholics in the history of the British Empire  (or indeed members of the Irish House of Lords) to have been granted a proprietary colony. Colonial Maryland was considerably larger than the present-day State of Maryland.  The original charter granted the Calverts an imprecisely defined territory north of Virginia and south of the 40th parallel, comprising perhaps as much as 12 million acres (49,000 km²).   In the 1760s Maryland would lose some of its original territory to Pennsylvania when, after Charles II granted that colony a tract that overlapped the Maryland grant, the Mason-Dixon Line was drawn to resolve the boundary dispute between the two colonies. Early settlement  In Maryland, Baltimore sought to create a haven for English Catholics and to demonstrate that Catholics and Protestants could live together harmoniously, even issuing the Act Concerning Religion in matters of religion. Cæcilius Calvert was himself a convert to Catholicism, a considerable political handicap for a nobleman in 17th century England, where Roman Catholics could easily be considered enemies of the crown and potential traitors to their country. Like other aristocratic proprietors, he also hoped to turn a profit on the new colony.The Calvert family recruited Catholic aristocrats and Protestant settlers for Maryland, luring them with generous land grants and a policy of religious toleration.  Of the 200 or so initial settlers who traveled to Maryland on the ships Ark and Dove, the majority were Protestant. In fact, Protestants remained in the majority throughout the history of colonial Maryland. The Ark and the Dove landed at St. Clement's Island on March 25, 1634.  The new settlers were led by Lord Baltimore's younger brother Leonard Calvert, whom Baltimore had delegated to serve as governor of the new colony.  The 150 or so surviving immigrants purchased land from the Yaocomico Indians and founded St. Mary's City. GovernmentMaryland's foundational charter created a state ruled by the Palatine lord, Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter.  He possessed absolute authority over his domain.  Settlers were required to swear allegiance to him rather than to the King of England. The charter created an aristocracy of lords of the manor, who bought 6,000 acres (24 km²) from Baltimore and held greater legal and social privileges than the common settlers.  However, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the House of Commons of England. Andrews, p.70  An act was passed providing that:  "from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly...together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them...shall think good". In addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he was pleased to select.  In some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that "assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least", ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.  Conflict with Native AmericansIn 1642, the colony Maryland declared war on the Susquehannock Indian nation. The Susquehannock (with the help of the colony of New Sweden) defeated Maryland in 1644. The Susquehannocks remained in an inactive state of war with Maryland until a peace treaty was concluded in 1652.  Records from this era are poor and accounts of these early conflicts are incomplete.  Religious conflict and the English Civil War From 1644 to 1646, the so-called "Plundering Time" was a period of civil unrest caused by the tensions of the English Civil War (1641–1651).  Governor Leonard Calvert led colonial defenses against Parliamentary privateers such as Captain Richard Ingle and William Claiborne.  In 1649 Maryland passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian Christians. Passed on September 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland Colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American Colonies. The Calvert family, who had founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics, sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of England and her colonies.  In 1654, after the Third English Civil War (1649–1651), Parliamentary (Puritan) forces assumed control of Maryland and Governor William Stone went into exile in the Colony of Virginia.  Stone returned the following spring at the head of a Cavalier (Roman Catholic) force and marched on Annapolis. At this time there were about 4,500 colonists in Maryland. In what is known as the Battle of the Severn (March 25, 1655), Stone was defeated and taken prisoner.  Stone was replaced as Governor by Josias Fendall (ca. 1628-1687).   Protestant Revolution of 1689   In 1689, Maryland Puritans, by now a substantial majority in the colony, revolted against the proprietary government, in part because of the apparent preferment of Catholics like Colonel Henry Darnall to official positions of power. Led by Colonel John Coode, an army of 700 Puritans defeated a proprietarial army led by Colonel Darnall. Roark, Elisabeth Louise, p.78, Artists of colonial America Retrieved February 22, 2010  Darnall later wrote: "Wee being in this condition and no hope left of quieting the people thus enraged, to prevent effusion of blood, capitulated and surrendered." The victorious Coode and his Puritans set up a new government that outlawed Catholicism, and Darnall was deprived of all his official positions.  Coode's government was however unpopular and both William III and Coode himself wished to install a crown-appointed governor. This man ended up being Lionel Copley who governed Maryland until his death in 1694 and was replaced by Francis Nicholson.  After this "Protestant Revolution" in Maryland, Darnall was forced, like many other Catholics, to maintain a secret chapel in his home in order to celebrate the Roman Catholic Mass. In 1704 an Act was passed "to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province", preventing Catholics from holding political office.  Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Darnall's great-grandson Charles Carroll of Carrollton, arguably the wealthiest Catholic in Maryland, signed the American Declaration of Independence.In 1672, Lord Baltimore declared Maryland included the settlement of Whorekills on the west shore of the Delaware Bay, an area under the jurisdiction of the Province of New York (as the British had renamed New Netherland after taking possession in 1664). A force was dispatched which attacked and captured this settlement.  New York could not immediately respond because New York was soon recaptured by the Dutch. Maryland feared the Dutch would use their Iroquois allies to recapture the settlement.  This settlement was restored to the Province of New York when New York was recaptured from the Dutch in November, 1674.  Plantation economyIn the 17th century, most Marylanders lived in rough conditions on small family farms.  While they raised a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, and livestock, the cash crop was tobacco, which soon came to dominate the provincial economy.  Tobacco was sometimes used as money, and the colonial legislature was obliged to pass a law requiring tobacco planters to raise a certain amount of corn as well, in order to ensure that the colonists would not go hungry. 18th CenturyLike its larger neighbor, Virginia, Maryland developed into a plantation colony by the 18th century. In 1700 there were about 25,000 people and by 1750 that had grown more than 5 times to 130,000. By 1755, about 40% of Maryland's population was black.   Maryland planters also made extensive use of indentured servants and penal labor.  An extensive system of rivers facilitated the movement of produce from inland plantations to the Atlantic coast for export. Baltimore was the second-most important port in the eighteenth-century South, after Charleston, South Carolina.In the latter colonial period, the southern and eastern portions of the Province continued in their tobacco economy, but as the American Revolution approached, northern and central Maryland increasingly became centers of wheat production. This helped drive the expansion of interior farming towns like Frederick and Maryland's major port city of Baltimore.  Maryland lost some of its original territory to Pennsylvania in the 1760s when, after Charles II granted Pennsylvania a tract that overlapped the Maryland grant, the Mason-Dixon Line was drawn to resolve the boundary dispute between the two colonies.    The American Revolution  Up to the time of the American Revolution, Province of Maryland was one of two colonies that remained an English proprietary colony, Pennsylvania being the other.  Maryland declared independence from Britain in 1776, with Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton signing the Declaration of Independence for the colony.  In the 1776-77 debates over the Articles of Confederation, Maryland delegates led the party that insisted that states with western land claims cede them to the Confederation government, and in 1781, Maryland became the last state to ratify the Articles of Confederation.  It accepted the United States Constitution more readily, ratifying it on April 28, 1788.Maryland also ceded some territory to create the new District of Columbia after the American Revolution.

Claiborne, Maryland Claiborne is an unincorporated community in Talbot County, Maryland. The village is located on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay near the mouth of the Eastern Bay at  , and uses ZIP code 21624. The 2000 U.S. Census lists the population as 147 and the number of homes as 84, slightly down from its 1941 population of 156. Between 1890 and 1952, the village was a busy port for passenger and then automobile ferry service across the Chesapeake Bay, with numerous stores and motels/resorts, including Maple Hall. A post office was added in 1893 and  the Protestant Episcopal Church of Claiborne was built in 1898. In 1912 an elementary school and Methodist Church were added. Before 1912, students attended school in nearby McDaniel. The town's first school consisted of the kitchen of the local railroad pavilion, used as a classroom, where Miss Dolly Thompson taught. Teachers in later years included Grace Oldham, Alice Dawson, Edna Harrison, and Lida Smith. In 1913, the town became home to the Claiborne Fresh Air Association, Inc., (“Miracle House”) which was formed for the purpose of providing 10 weeks of fresh air and summer vacation for children who had been exposed to tuberculosis. HistoryPrior to the 1870s, Claiborne was part of the nearby McDanieltown postal community (now McDaniel). Its name can be traced back in honor of William Claiborne, a fur trader who founded an English settlement on nearby Kent Island in 1631. Early land patents in Claiborne included "Rich Neck Manor," which was first granted to James Mitchell in 1652. Either Mitchell or the subsequent owner of Rich Neck, Philip Land, built a chapel in the 1650s. The Rich Neck Manor Chapel still stands and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, but is private property. Rich Neck was also home to Matthew Tilghman, the head of the Maryland delegation to the Continental Congress, and Lloyd Tilghman, Confederate general.It was past the entrance to today's Claiborne harbor that British vessels passed during the War of 1812, landing in McDanieltown, within sight of Claiborne. The area of town now known as "Old Claiborne," was located on Tilghman’s Creek facing the Miles River. It included a steam sawmill started by John Hansel Tunis around 1867. "Bingham's Steamboat Wharf" was also in use for steamboats on their way up the Miles River to St. Michaels. By 1877, John Tunis' son, Joseph Tunis, had added the Claiborne Oyster Company, a boatyard, a few homes, two more steamboat wharves, and expanded his father's sawmill into the Claiborne Saw and Planing Mills. At the foot of Rich Neck Road was a general store. Tunis also laid out grids for a new community of 188 lots and advertised them for between $18 and $40. A plat of it appears in an 1877 county atlas, showing eight main streets with the names: Rich Neck Road, Leeds, Ward, Progress, Monument, Tilghman, and Dom Pedro. At its center was Henry Clay Square, a large area reserved for public buildings. Joseph Tunis provided a slogan: “Young man don’t go West, but to Claiborne.” The village did not develop as Tunis had hoped and by 1893, Tunis had abandoned his plans. In later years several families from North Carolina who knew or where employed by the Tunis family in their North Carolina lumber mills relocated to "Old Claiborne", for example Ben Perry whose home in "Old Claiborne" was built in 1905.A second community, the "new" Claiborne, was started in 1886 when Gen. Joseph B. Seth and the Baltimore & Eastern Railroad Company agreed to begin ferry and railroad service between Claiborne and Bay Ridge, on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Seth along with Theophilus Tunis and Frank Turner envisioned a resort community similar to Bay Ridge and laid out plans for the "new" Claiborne, calling it "Bay City”.Although "Bay City" never developed as expected, Claiborne’s importance was raised once the ferries began operating with Claiborne as a primary terminus on the Eastern Shore. In 1890 the Baltimore & Eastern Railroad completed a railroad line from Claiborne to Easton so that passengers coming into Claiborne could continue through to Ocean City. Later operated by the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway, the railroad service continued until 1928, although by 1924 the BC&A had already shifted most of its traffic to Love Point. In 1927 the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway filed for bankruptcy and was sold at foreclosure on March 28, 1928. One parcel was for the company's railroad and the Claiborne ferry, and was sold for $650,000. The ferry operation by the Baltimore, Chesapeake, & Atlantic Railway was almost halted in 1915 due to a decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission against the BC&A's parent company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, dictating that the company surrender some of the steamboat lines which they operated on the Chesapeake Bay. In the end, the Pennsylvania Railroad had to sell off or end all its ferry lines operating between Baltimore and points on the Eastern Shore other than the one at Claiborne.A second ferry company, owned by the son of Hetty Green, began service in 1916 between Claiborne and Annapolis using the steam yacht "Texas". The business failed in 1919.In 1919, a competing ferry, the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company, began service between Claiborne and Annapolis. On Sunday evening it was not uncommon for traffic to be backed up several miles into Claiborne, waiting for the return ferry trip across the Chesapeake Bay. The increased automobile traffic to Claiborne forced the state to take the then unusual step of passing a special roads bill to improve the road between Claiborne and Easton, Maryland. In 1921, bus service was added from Claiborne to Easton, Hurlock, and Cambridge. This may have been in part because of accusations that the BC&A's passenger railroad service out of Claiborne would often intentionally leave early to strand passengers arriving on the competing boats of the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company. In 1938 the ferry route was changed to run from Claiborne to Romancoke on Kent Island, and then Matapeake on Kent Island to Sandy Point, on the western shore. Ferry service stopped running in 1952 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built.Jolly Sam, the Christmas pony, now resides at Mineral Spring Farm, in Claiborne, he arrived in early spring 2007.

Flag of Maryland   The flag of the state of Maryland consists of the heraldic banner of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. It is the only state flag in the United States to be based  on English heraldry. (While the flag of Washington, D.C., is a representation of the coat of arms of the Washington family, Washington, D.C., is not a state.) It was officially adopted by Maryland in 1904. DesignThe black and gold design on the flag is the coat of arms of the Calvert family. It was granted to George Calvert as a reward for his storming a fortification during a battle (the vertical bars approximate the bars of the palisade).  The red and white design is the coat of arms of the Crossland family, the family of Calvert's mother, and features a cross bottony. Since George Calvert's mother was an heiress, he was entitled to use both coats of arms in his banner. HistoryThe Maryland colony was founded by Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, hence the use of his coat of arms in the flag. At first, only the gold and black Calvert arms were associated with Maryland, being reintroduced in 1854. Maryland State Flag History (Maryland Secretary of State.) Retrieved August 29, 2012.  The red and white Crossland arms, which belonged to the family of Calvert's paternal grandmother, gained popularity during the American Civil War, during which Maryland remained with the Union despite many citizens' support for the Confederacy. Those Marylanders who supported the Confederacy, many of whom fought in the Army of Northern Virginia, adopted the Crossland banner, which was red and white with the botony (trefoil) cross   (seen as "secession colors"). . The black and gold (yellow) colors with the chevron design of the Calvert family were used in the flags and devices of the Union regiments in the Army of the Potomac.After the war, Marylanders who had fought on either side of the conflict returned to their state in need of reconciliation. The present design, which incorporates both of the coats of arms used by George Calvert, began appearing. At first, the Crossland coat of arms was put in the upper-left corner, but this was supposedly swapped with the Union's Calvert arms because of the Union victory. The flag in its present form was first flown on October 11, 1880, in Baltimore, Maryland, at a parade marking the 150th anniversary of the founding of Baltimore. It also was flown on October 25, 1888, at the Gettysburg Battlefield during ceremonies dedicating monuments to Maryland regiments of the Army of the Potomac. However, it was not officially adopted as the state flag until 1904 (Chapter 48, Acts of 1904, effective March 9, 1904). In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Maryland's flag fourth best in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territory flags ranked.  Legal description Section 13–202 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland provides:  (a) The State flag is quartered. (b) The 1st and 4th quarters are paly of 6 pieces, or and sable, a bend dexter counterchanged. Thus, the 1st and 4th quarters consist of 6 vertical bars alternately gold and black with a diagonal band on which the colors are reversed. (c) The 2nd and 3rd quarters are quarterly argent and gules, a cross bottony counterchanged.  Thus, the 2nd and 3rd quarters are a quartered field of red and white, charged with a Greek cross, its arms terminating in trefoils, with the coloring transported, red being on the white ground and white on the red, and all being as represented upon the escutcheon of the State seal.  The Maryland Secretary of State publishes a "Protocol for the Maryland State Flag" which, among other things, specifies the colors of the flag:1.04. The red and yellow colors in the Maryland flag should conform to the following Pantone Matching System colors:  red on coated stock: PMS 201 red on uncoated stock: PMS 193 yellow on coated stock: PMS 124 yellow on uncoated stock: PMS 124   Flagpole restrictions Maryland is the only state in the union that has a specific guideline not only on how to display the flag but on what the flagpole should look like as well. In 1945, the Maryland General Assembly made a gold cross bottony the official ornament for any flagpole carrying the state flag. Some time before October 10, 2007, Government House (the governor's mansion) in Annapolis ceased to display the cross bottony at the top of the flag pole, but the flags at the State House continue to do so (adhering to Maryland Code Section 13-202 and 203). All other government buildings, including public schools, obey this guideline, but many private individuals and businesses do not. Cultural impactThe Calvert and Crossland coats of arms, and the flag itself, have been adapted for use in various ways across the state.  On September 9, 2008, the University of Maryland painted both end zones at Byrd Stadium with the flag's two patterns. Some Maryland counties and municipalities have arms and/or flags incorporating elements of the arms, including the city of Baltimore, Baltimore County, Howard County, Calvert County, Caroline County and Worcester County. The University of Maryland athletic teams have long used the colors of the state flag. All four colors from the flag are currently used, with the primary colors being red and white, with black and gold used as accent colors. The men's basketball team uses gold and the football team uses black as alternate colors. The Maryland flag is also displayed on the right shoulder of the football uniforms. At the start of the 2011 football season, the team unveiled a new uniform designed  by Baltimore-based sportswear company Under Armour combining both parts of the flag. Similarly, the men's lacrosse team features designed from the flag on the jersey shoulders. The end zones of Byrd Stadium are often decorated in a Maryland flag motif, and the state flag is run onto the field during almost all the athletic games. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), also in the University System of Maryland, has all four colors located in its main logo. The shield of Loyola University Maryland utilizes both the Calvert shield in its upper-left quadrant, as well as a stylized red and yellow quadrant, symbolic of the Maryland state flag. The seal of The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore features the same design and colors as the Maryland flag. The Johns Hopkins colors are sable and gold, taken from the Calvert coat of arms (though the athletic colors are blue and white, as the school mascot is the Blue Jay). The secondary logo of the Baltimore Ravens in the National Football League is a shield with alternating Calvert and Crossland Banners interlocked with a stylized "B" and "R". Starting with the 2009 season, the Baltimore Orioles baseball club has added a patch to the left arm of their uniforms that features a round version of the Maryland flag. The gold and black Calvert coat of arms and red and white Crossland coat of arms are featured in the seal of the town of Ferryland, Newfoundland, present day site of Calvert's Colony of Avalon. Southwest Airlines changed the livery of a 737-700 to a Maryland state flag theme in 2005, dubbed Maryland One.

University of Maryland Eastern Shore       University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) located on 776 acres (2.5 km²) in Princess Anne, Maryland, United States, is part of the University System of Maryland. UMES is a historically black university, as well as an 1890 Historically Black Land-Grant University. The University is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. HistoryThe school was founded in 1886 through the offices of the Delaware Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and was known as the Delaware Conference Academy.  Later UMES came to be called Industrial Branch of Morgan State College and Princess Anne Academy.  The State of Maryland, in operating its Land-Grant program at the Maryland Agricultural College at College Park (now the University of Maryland, College Park), which did not admit African American students, sought to provide a Land-Grant program for African Americans.  In 1919 the state of Maryland assumed control of the academy and changed its name to Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Agricultural College. In 1948 the name was again changed, this time to Maryland State College.  In 1970, the university obtained its current name of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.From its original campus building known as "Olney," which was constructed in 1798 during the era of President George Washington, the University has grown to over 745 acres with 32 major buildings and 41 other units.  The student population has increased to 4,500. Within the last decade, UMES has added 20 degree granting programs to its academic roster. AcademicsThe university comprises five schools:  School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences School of Arts and Professions School of Business and Technology School of Pharmacy and Health Professions School of Graduate Studies  Signature undergraduate programs are hotel and restaurant management, fashion merchandising, construction management, professional golf management (sanctioned by the PGA), aviation science, and teacher education. Business, criminal justice, and biology are the most popular majors. UMES also has a four-year engineering program and a baccalaureate program for training physician assistants.UMES offers master's degrees in applied computer science, criminology and criminal justice, food and agricultural science, rehabilitation counseling, marine and environmental science, and toxicology. UMES also offers a Master of Education (M.Ed) in career and technology education, special education, and counseling. A Master of Arts in teaching (MAT) in art education, agriculture, biology, business, chemistry, English, family and consumer sciences, math, music, social studies, or technology education is offered through the Department of Education. UMES offers doctorates in food science and technology, marine and environmental sciences, toxicology, and organizational leadership. Other terminal degree programs include doctorates in physical therapy (DPT) and educational leadership (EDLD)-- and starting in the fall of 2010, a doctor of pharmacy doctorate (Pharm.D.). Student life Athletics   UMES was one of the founding members of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference in 1970.  The school left the MEAC in 1979 but re-joined in 1981 and has been a member ever since. The Hawks compete in 15 sports at the Division I level: seven men's and eight women's.  Previous to 1970, UMES was a member of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association.The school was once a powerhouse in black college football, producing five undefeated seasons between 1947 and 1960, but like many smaller colleges, the high costs associated with operating a Division I football program and complying with Title IX became too much of a burden, and the team was shut down after the 1979 season. In 1948, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and Albright College played the first intercollegiate football game between an Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) institution and a majority-white institution.  NFL player and coach Art Shell attended UMES.UMES is tied with Florida State for the most alumni appearing in a single Super Bowl game. In the 1968 game (Super Bowl III) between the New York Jets and the Baltimore Colts, UMES was represented by five alumni: Earl Christy (1961–1964), Johnny Sample (1954–1957), Emerson Boozer (1962–1965), Charlie Stukes (1963–1967), and James Duncan (1968–1971).The UMES women's bowling team won the NCAA Bowling Championship in 2012 in Ohio against Fairleigh Dickinson University and in Omaha, Nebraska against Arkansas State University in 2008. They won the series 4-2 (in a best of 7 match). The team was led by All-Tournament players Jessica Worsley (who was named the tournament MVP) and Maria Rodriguez. With the series win, UMES became the first HBCU to win a women's NCAA national championship.  The UMES women also won their second 2011 NCAA Bowling Championship in Taylor, Michigan against Vanderbilt University, also winning the series 4-2 (in a best of 7 match). Kristina Frahm (named tournament MVP) and Maria Rodriguez were named to the All-Tournament team en route to their victory. That season, along with the NCAA Championship, UMES also won the USBC Team Championships over Lindenwood University as well as the MEAC Championship.  In 2007 the women's bowling team came in 2nd at the NCAA National Championship in Orlando, Florida and fell to Vanderbilt University in a 4–3 series. The team was led by All-Tournament players Marion Singleton and Jessica Worsley. The UMES women's bowling team also won the MEAC Conference Championship in 2000, 2006, 2007, and 2008.UMES men's basketball is coached by Frankie Allen, who led the Hawks to an 9–22 record in the 2010–2011 season.  The school led the nation in scoring during the 1973–1974 season with 97.6 points per game, including future NBA picks Rubin Collins, Talvin Skinner, William Gordon and Joe Pace.  The team defeated Manhattan College 84-81 in the first round of the 1974 NIT and fell to Jacksonville University 85-83 in the quarterfinals.  The team has never played in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. During the 2010–11 season, UMES had a men's and women's basketball player surpass the 1,000-career point mark.  Hillary Haley passed the mark on the men's side with a 24-point performance against Coppin State on February 19th, including his first season at St. Bonaventure.  On the women's side, Casey Morton scored 10 points against Savannah State to surpass the mark, finishing with 1,230 in four years with the Lady Hawks.  The next season, Adobi Agbasi finished third in Division I in blocks per game with 3.72 per contest, becoming the all-time shot-blocker in UMES women's basketball history with 239 total blocks, achieving that mark on March 1st, 2012 against Savannah State|.In 2011, the Hawks men's outdoor track team was ranked third in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association, and subsequently was the highest ranked team in the state of Maryland.  The following season, three UMES outdoor track athletes earned All-America status: Lenora Guion-Firmin earned First Team in the 400-meter dash, later earning a spot with the French 4x400-meter team in the 2012 Summer Olympics, while Andre Walsh and Vanessa Henry, in the men's 400-meter hurdles and women's shot put, earned Second Team.The UMES women's volleyball team won its first MEAC championship in the history of the school in November of 2011 with a win over Florida A&M in the title game, earning its first NCAA Tournament berth ever.  The Hawks fell to eventual national champion UCLA in the first round.  In 2012, the team repeated as MEAC champions with another five-set win over Florida A&M to advance to the NCAAs again, falling to 4-seed Nebraska in its first match.  The team has won the MEAC Northern Division each of the past six years, combining to go 61-3 in conference regular season matches in that time, plus holds the longest current home-winning streak in Division I, being victorious in its last 30 matches at home.

University of Maryland School of NursingThe University of Maryland School of Nursing, founded in 1889 by Nightingale Fund graduate Louisa Parsons, is one of the oldest and one of the largest nursing schools in the nation.  The School is known for innovative educational programs that address urgent healthcare needs nationally and internationally.  The school pioneered the first nursing informatics program in the world and the nation's first nursing health policy program.  According to the most recent nursing school rankings, The University of Maryland School of Nursing was ranked the 7th best nursing school in the 2008 edition of U.S. News & World Report.The School of Nursing building, which opened in November 1998, shares a   campus in downtown Baltimore with five professional schools — Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy and Social Work — as well as the University of Maryland Medical System and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The campus is a national leader in health sciences research, with $256 million in grants and contracts in fiscal year 2001.The School of Nursing has pioneered a variety of innovative educational programs, including the first nursing informatics program in the world and the nation’s first nursing health policy program.  More than 20 specialties are offered at the graduate level, including trauma/critical-care, oncology, gerontology, psychiatric/mental health nursing, and nursing administration. In 1999, the School of Nursing became the only school in Maryland to offer a midwifery program, pre-accredited by the American College of Nurse Midwives.  Nurse practitioner options are also offered in family, pediatrics, women’s health, neonatal intensive care, adult primary care, acute care and geriatrics.A variety of flexible and combined programs are offered to accelerate degree completion. These include the second bachelor's degree option, the RN to BSN online program, the RN to MS program, the post-baccalaureate entry option into the PhD program, and the MS/MBA and PhD/MBA programs offered in conjunction with the University of Baltimore; Frostburg State University; and the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland College Park. Partnership programs for BSN completion join the School of Nursing with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the University of Maryland College Park, Washington College in Chestertown, MD, as well as all of Maryland's community colleges.To provide clinical programs for students, the School of Nursing maintains affiliations with more than 300 hospitals and health care agencies throughout Maryland. In addition, within the   School of Nursing building are clinical simulation laboratories, which also afford students hands-on training in a real-life setting.The School of Nursing offers a wide range of courses at off-campus locations. Students can enroll at numerous outreach sites throughout the state, permitting residents in remote, educationally under-served areas to complete undergraduate and graduate degrees in nursing. Linking regional, national and international audiences, the School incorporates the most advanced classroom and laboratory design, as well as modern distance learning communications technology, to provide a state-of-the-art education experience.The School of Nursing Living History Museum, officially opened in October, 1999, examines the history of the nursing profession from its earliest days to present day. University of Maryland School of PharmacyThe University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, founded in 1841, is the fourth oldest school of pharmacy in the nation and was the first pharmacy school established in Maryland. The School of Pharmacy comprises three departments, Pharmacy Practice and Science, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Pharmaceutical Health Services Research. The school admitted 11.4% of applicants for the 2006-2007 school year.  According to the most recent pharmacy school rankings, The University of Maryland School of Pharmacy was ranked 17th among pharmacy schools in the 2012 edition of U.S. News & World Report. University of Maryland School of Social WorkThe University of Maryland School of Social Work is a top program in social work education. Graduates of the School of Social Work have become policymakers at all levels of government, from the U.S. Senate to the state and federal courts, to the State Department and departments of social services. Graduates also work as educators and researchers at universities across the country and have become therapists, community organizers, and managers. According to the most recent rankings, The University of Maryland School of Social Work was ranked 18th among schools of social work in the 2008 edition of U.S. News & World Report and 16th in 2012. UMB Graduate SchoolThe Graduate School was founded in 1918. UMB graduate school offers 43 degree programs in total. Library FacilitiesThe University of Maryland, Baltimore has two main libraries on its campus: the Health Sciences & Human Services Library (HS/HSL) and the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.UMB's Health Sciences & Human Services Library was founded in  1813 from the collection of Doctor John Crawford, a former British naval surgeon, and is the origin of the entire University of Maryland Library System. Dr. Crawford's initial donation of books remains within the library's Historical Collections department as the Crawford Collection (comprising some 569 items).  The first location of the library was the Provost's Office within the original medical school building, now known as Davidge Hall. Under the leadership of its first official library, Dr. Eugene F. Cordell (who served as library director from 1903-1913), the library grew rapidly, incorporating book collections from the schools of pharmacy and dentistry, and moving into its own building, a former church on the southeast corner of Lombard and Green Streets. The church was later razed in 1957 to make way for a new library that began construction in 1958 and opened in 1960. The library has since moved, in 1998, into a large modern building. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library, named for Baltimore native and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, is the law library for the University of Maryland School of Law. The Marshall Law Library is found inside the law school's building, accessible through the main entrance. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library contains over 400,000 volumes of Anglo-American legal materials as well as outstanding international and foreign law collections. Extensive collections of both primary sources and secondary materials such as treatises are available.  The library is open to all faculty, staff and students on the campuses of the University System of Maryland; University of Maryland School of Law alumni; attorneys; and members of the general public.  Name of the InstitutionThe professional schools housed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore may also simply use the name "University of Maryland" when describing themselves even though the University of Maryland, College Park also refers to itself simply as the University of Maryland. There is relatively little confusion resulting from the shared name because the University of Maryland, College Park offers largely research-oriented graduate programs and houses fewer professional schools. The University of Maryland, Baltimore does not offer NCAA sports. Although this university mainly offer graduate and professional study, it offers few undergraduate courses, which include nursing, dental hygiene and medical technology. By law and tradition each school is entitled to use the "University of Maryland" name in recognition of their shared history.  While both schools are University System of Maryland institutions, neither is a part of the other.The University of Maryland, Baltimore is also often mistaken for the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), which is a separate University System of Maryland institution located in the town of Catonsville, outside the City of Baltimore. Campus The campus is composed of 58 buildings located near Camden Yards and Baltimore's famous Lexington Market. Construction on a new   campus center began at the start of 2007 and opened in August 2009 as the Southern Management Corporation Campus Center (SMC Center).  The SMC Center contains dining facilities, meeting locations and the campus's gymnasium and recreation facility, URecFit. UMB has also recently undertaken a vast west campus expansion. This   project, known as BioPark, will create ten new buildings containing a total of   of classroom, lab, and office space.  In addition, University of Maryland Medical System has cleared a downtown site for the construction of a $329 million ambulatory care center.The university is served by the University Center/Baltimore Street station of the Baltimore Light Rail system, which is at the eastern edge of campus. The Orange Route of the free Charm City Circulator provides service to both the BioPark and through the UMB campus to the inner harbor and points east.Starting with the 2012-2013 school year, the University launched a new shuttle bus service for university students, staff, and faculty and University of Maryland Medical Center employees free of charge. The shuttle runs 3 routes from the university to West Baltimore (the new BioPark center), Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon.  Campus PoliceThe university is protected through the University of Maryland, Baltimore Police Department. The UMB Police department is a state and nationally accredited police agency providing law enforcement services to the UMB campus and surrounding communities.    Through an agreement signed between the UMB Police Department and the Baltimore City Police Department, UMB Police officers have the same jurisdiction and authority as Baltimore City Police officers throughout the campus of the university.  The UMB police force is composed of both sworn officers and unarmed security guards who are located in university-owned buildings to control access to the buildings and for other security purposes.  The UMB Police force also provides escort services to students and university personnel throughout the campus, either though an escort vehicle, or a walking escort by an officer.

Robert Alexander (Maryland)  Robert Alexander (c. 1740 – 1805) was an American planter, lawyer, and Tory political leader during the American Revolution. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress for Maryland in 1776. BackgroundRobert Alexander was born on his family's estate at Head of Elk in Cecil County, Maryland about 1740. He was educated to the law and admitted to the bar, and practiced in Baltimore. From 1774 to 1776, he attended the Annapolis Convention as a representative of Baltimore County. He also represented Baltimore in the state's Committee of Safety. On December 9, 1775 the Convention named Alexander one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. He attended sessions starting in January 1776, and on January 16 the Congress added him to their Secret Committee. Then in April he was added to the Marine Committee. He was re-elected, 4 July 1776, but soon after the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence he sailed for England with other Baltimore loyalists.In August 1777, after British forces had landed at Head of Elk, he was visited at his home, first by George Washington on the 27th, and then by British General Howe three days later. When the British moved north towards Philadelphia he accompanied them, and was never to return. By the summer of 1778, when Howe abandoned the occupation of Philadelphia, Alexander fled to the Royal Navy, and made his way to London in 1782.In 1780, the State of Maryland judged Alexander guilty of high treason, and seized most of his property. His estate became the town Elkton, Maryland, although the wife he had abandoned was allowed to keep the main house that his father had built in 1735. The house still stands, and is located at 323 Hermitage Drive in Elkton.Alexander died in exile in London, England on November 20, 1805. References  Further reading  Janet B.

Clarksville, Maryland Clarksville is the name of an unincorporated community in Howard County, the third wealthiest county in the United States according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The community is named for William Clark, a farmer who owned much of the land on which the community now lies. According to the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau, Clarksville District 5 had a population of 56,239, with median income of $150,272. The estimated average income in 2009 was $195,124, with median income of $160,606. Some of the most expensive homes on the East Coast are located in or around the town, whose property values are among the highest in the country. The villages of River Hill  and Pheasants Ridge are contained within Clarksville, the newest additions to the planned community of Columbia. Clarksville's public schools, part of the Howard County public school system, are among the highest-ranked in the nation and often have significantly higher funding than competing private and charter schools.  The area is located southwest of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C., and many residents of Clarksville commute to work in one of these two cities or their close-in suburbs.Montrose and Richland Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.    SchoolingClarksville is perhaps best known for its highly successful high school, River Hill. The school made the 397th rank on Newsweek's Top 1,200 High School    River Hill, opened in 1996  It has 1,652 students and ranks as one of the top schools in the state of Maryland.  In 2005, River Hill has a 97.55% graduation rate, ranking the highest in Maryland.  86.3% of its students passed the HSA (High school Assessment). River Hill is also very successful in sports, capturing numerous state titles in many sports. The boy’s soccer team has captured three of the last four class 3A state titles (losing in 2006 to rival Mount Hebron).  In 2007 River Hill won five state championships in the fall: Football, Boys and Girls Soccer, and Boys and Girls Cross Country. In addition, Clarksville Middle School's Wind Ensemble attended the prestigious Midwest Clinic in 2009, being the first middle school from Maryland to perform there. Pop culture Clarksville, MD was referenced in the Fox television show 24 as the target for surface missiles by terrorists in the seventh season episode having the original air date 4/13/09.

Maryland State House  The Maryland State House is located in Annapolis and is the oldest state capitol in continuous legislative use, dating to 1772. It houses the Maryland General Assembly and offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The capitol has the distinction of being topped by the largest wooden dome in the United States constructed without nails. The current building, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960     is the third statehouse on its site. The building is administered by the State House Trust, which was created in 1969. ConstructionConstruction began in 1772 and was not completed until 1779 due to the ongoing American Revolutionary War. The statehouse was designed by Joseph Horatio Anderson, a noted architect of the time. The two-story building is of brick construction in the middle of State Circle. The building is designed in the popular Georgian style of the day. A small portico juts out from the center of the building and is topped by a pediment, two high arched windows frame the entrance. On both floors, large rectangular windows line the facade. A cornice is topped by another pediment and the sloping roof gives way for a central octagonal drum atop which rests a dome. The large dome is topped by a balustraded balcony, another octagonal drum and a lantern capped by a lightning rod. The rod was constructed and grounded according to the direct specifications of its inventor, Benjamin Franklin.    The dome of the statehouse is depicted on the Maryland state quarter. RotundaIn the rotunda is the Maryland Federalist a replica built in 1987 of the miniature ship Federalist. Large Corinthian columns support the arches bracing the large dome above. A balustrade lines the second floor balcony.The replica of the Maryland Fedealist is actually on a more or less permanent display in the Lobby at the Thurgood Marshall Baltimore Washington International Airport Terminal. Later in the summer of 2012, the original handwritten text of George Washington's Resignation Letter will be on display in the Rotundra of the Capital. This can be confirmed by contacting the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis, MD. Chambers Old Senate ChamberTo the right of the entrance is the old Senate Chamber. Chairs and desks were added to the room in the exact number (16) as originally furbished. The desk for the president is an original piece made by John Shaw in 1797.It was in the Old Senate Chamber that George Washington famously resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. A mannequin of George Washington stands in period clothing at the front of the room.Less well known, but important nonetheless, is the historic event that occurred on February 2, 1781 when Governor Thomas Sim Lee, in the presence of the members of both Houses of the State Legislature, signed and sealed the "act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the Articles of Confederation."   The decision established the requisite unanimous consent of all thirteen states for the formation of a Perpetual Union. This was the final act of formation of the United States of America as a nation. The approval of the much awaited law also removed any doubt about the resolve of the states to unite during the Revolutionary War. In 1861, the fact that "the faith of all the then thirteen States was expressly plighted and engaged that [the Union] should be perpetual" was considered of major importance by President Abraham Lincoln when declaring the secession of the southern states from the Union to be illegal.The chamber had extensive investigation beginning in 2007 to solve water leakage problems. As a result of this study, restorers have determined that previous restoration attempts in 1905 and 1940 did not accurately recreate many elements of the room. A report of their findings was issued in January 2010 and work continues.    Working Senate ChamberThe Senate chamber is located in a wing added to the original structure between 1902 and 1905. The room is illuminated by a Tiffany-style skylight above. Red carpet emblazoned with the state seal covers the entire floor. Large Ionic columns line the walls and support the viewing gallery. The marble along the walls and the columns are flecked with rust and black, Maryland's official colors.Two famous Marylanders are featured in statues flanking the podium: John Hanson, the first president by the Articles of Confederation, and Charles Carroll, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Four portraits of Declaration of Independence signatories for Maryland hang on the walls: William Paca, Thomas Stone, Samuel Chase, and Charles Carroll.    There are also portraits of Edwin Warfield and John Walter Smith.    Working House ChamberThe House of Delegates chamber is also in the new wing to the building. The carpet is navy blue and designed with a diamond and olive sheaths. The same rust and black marble lines the chamber and forms the Ionic columns along the walls. A spectators' gallery is above the rostrum. The speaker sits in front of a broken marble pediment supporting a clock. Portraits of former Speakers of the House hang on the walls. Governor's Reception RoomThe Governor's Reception Room is on the second floor. The room is mainly ceremonial and used for bill signings. Portraits of former governors hang on the walls. Portraits of Henrietta Maria and Queen Anne hang nearby.    United States CapitalFrom November 26, 1783 to August 13, 1784, Annapolis was the capital of the United States. The Congress of the Confederation met in the Maryland State House. Subsequently, Annapolis was a candidate to become the new permanent national capital before Washington, D.C. was built. United States district courtThe United States District Court for the District of Maryland met there for the first decade of its existence.    In 1800, judge Samuel Chase tried a local postmaster for embezzlement and sentenced him to thirty-nine lashes. To execute the sentence, the defendant was tied to one of the statehouse columns.

University of Maryland University College    The University of Maryland University College (UMUC) is located in the unincorporated community of Adelphi in Prince George's County, Maryland in the United States. Serving over 90,000 students worldwide, UMUC is one of the largest distance learning universities    that is open to all applicants with a 100 percent acceptance rate for undergraduate programs.    The university offers 120 academic programs in instructor-led and online classes, including bachelor, masters, and doctoral degrees as well as undergraduate and graduate certificates. Profile - USM   UMUC is a member of the University System of Maryland, which includes eleven separate public universities in Maryland.    History UMUC is an outgrowth of the evening program for adults at the University of Maryland that began in the 1920s. In 1947, the College of Special and Continuation Studies (CSCS) was established. Page Does Not Exist   In 1959, The CSCS became the University of Maryland University College (UMUC). In 1970, UMUC became an independent institution, and it became a member of the University System of Maryland in 1988. UMUC formerly had an international campus in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany (near Stuttgart) until 2001. It also ran a 2-year residential campus in Munich, Germany from 1950 to 1992, which then moved to Augsburg, Germany from 1993 to 1994, and then to Mannheim, Germany in 1995 until it finally closed in 2005.  The residential campus offered a two-year Associates degree and mainly served high school graduate children of U.S. military and government personnel stationed in Europe.UMUC offers courses on over 130 military installations at locations throughout Europe and the Middle East, as well as in Asia.  In 2004, UMUC shared the ICDE Prize of Excellence from the International Council for Open and Distance Education.  In FY 2007, UMUC offered onsite classes in 22 countries throughout the world, enrolling 16,908 and 21,554 individual students, respectively, through its Asia and Europe divisions, including the Middle East.  University nameUMUC is a college in the traditional American sense of the word, albeit one associated with a university—hence, "University College." The "University of Maryland" prefix indicates the historical entity to which the college belonged originally. In the university's name, "University College" represents "the specialized concentration on professional development," while "University of Maryland" represents the affiliation of the university with the University System of Maryland.    To American ears, the words "university" and "college" may sound synonymous, and "University College" would be redundant in its name. Among the collegiate universities of Europe, however, the practice of giving one college in the university the name "University College" is not uncommon. In England, for example, one of the 39 colleges of the University of Oxford is called University College, Oxford. When UMUC first opened in 1947, the school was named College of Special and Continuation Studies to distinguish it as an institution independent from the University of Maryland, College Park.  In 1953, Raymond Ehrensberger, chancellor of the institution at that time, wanted to change the name to something more meaningful and less cumbersome for people to say and remember. Early suggestions for the name included College of General Studies, College of Adult Education and University College.  In 1959, Chancellor Ehrensberger persuaded the University System of Maryland's Board of Regents to change the name to University of Maryland University College. The name "University College" was adopted from the British university system to depict an educational institution offering "courses and programs from all academic departments outside the university's walls and normal class times."  Therefore, UMUC is not a division of the University of Maryland, College Park, but rather a separate institution within the University System of Maryland. Academic and degree programsUMUC is one of the largest providers of distance education in the United States.    Courses are delivered in traditional classroom settings, as well as online. Even before the advent of online education by way of the Internet, UMUC was a distance education pioneer and offered distance learning using its WebTycho interface by way of dial-up access. UMUC later adopted the use of the Internet for connectivity to its online classrooms, as well as using television and correspondence courses to deliver course content. Colleges and schools  Undergraduate School Graduate School   UndergraduateThe Undergraduate School offers 32 bachelor's degree programs and 48 undergraduate certificates,  which are awarded in business management, computers/information technology, communications, criminal justice/legal studies, and social sciences.  Undergraduate students can earn credit through classroom-based and online courses or through the Cooperative Education and Prior Learning programs. The Undergraduate program serves as a continuation of the Community Colleges of Maryland and elsewhere. The Cooperative Education and Prior Learning programs offer an escalated degree option for education and training completed in the workplace or military.  This program provides general education credits that can be applied towards a degree at UMUC. GraduateThe Graduate School offers 18 master's degree programs, 38 graduate certificates, and a Doctor of Management.  Most graduate programs are available in both classroom and online formats. Several master's degrees are available in an accelerated Executive format. Deployed Locations UMUC offers face-to-face courses and support in Afghanistan and Djibouti, Africa. UMUC deploys both faculty members and staff members to bases throughout Afghanistan and at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti to support the war-fighters on those bases. UMUC has accompanied the war-fighters in downrange locations since the Army gave them clearance in 2005. AfghanistanCurrently, UMUC offers courses and services at the four main Army Education Centers, located in Bagram Air Field, Kabul (Camp Phoenix), Salerno and Kandahar. Bagram Air Field is the largest site in Afghanistan, with about 275 active enrollments each session, and up to twenty face-to-face courses. All four sites have collegiate professors and Field Representatives stationed on them to assist soldiers, airmen, Marines, and sailors with UMUC's programs and courses.Field Representatives, commonly referred to as Field Reps, deploy with faculty members to help promote and facilitate UMUC's program at each site. Field Reps assist students with enrollment, tuition assistance, and textbook sales, as well as guidance and assistance with academic goals and careers. The Field Rep is also responsible for the local program, to include marketing and maintaining relationships with military personnel.Faculty members assigned to a downrange location teach service members wherever they may be. Classroom space is limited in Afghanistan, and faculty members teach their classes anywhere they can, to include hangars, unit conference rooms, dining facilities, even chapels and picnic benches. Faculty members, known and referred to as instructors, also assist the Field Rep located where they are in assisting students and promoting classes and programs. DjiboutiClasses are held at Camp Lemonnier on the Naval base in Djibouti City.  Classes are taught by on site faculty members and can also be taught by military personnel who hold Master's or Doctoral degrees and have prior teaching experience.  A full-time UMUC faculty member also serves as a counselor for students already enrolled in UMUC programs, and to those military members who would like to take classes.  Most students at Lemonnier receive tuition assistance through military programs to support higher education for its members. Campus and facilities  Headquarters/main campus The headquarters for UMUC is located in Adelphi, Maryland near the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park. Until late 2000, the UMUC headquarters was listed in College Park, Maryland. In an attempt to establish its own identity as an independent university and move away from the common notion of serving as the "night school" for non-traditional students, UMUC changed its postal address to Adelphi, an unincorporated community that borders College Park. The address change with the U.S. Postal Service involved no physical move of people and facilities. The marketing decision to change its postal address was one of many undertaken by UMUC to distinguish the university as one of the largest distance-education centers, with over 80,000 students enrolled worldwide. Academic buildings  Academic Center at Largo Student & Faculty Services Center (SFSC) (Headquarters) Inn & Conference Center (ICC)  UMUC purchased for $38 million its new headquarters building in Largo, Maryland, which was once the headquarters site for Hechinger and corporate offices of Raytheon.    UMUC retrofitted its new headquarters to meet "green" building requirements for LEED certification.  UMUC followed the same process as it did to achieve LEED certification in 2005 for its Inn & Conference Center, which became the first hotel complex in the United States to achieve certification as a green building.  UMUC began relocating its academic departments and offices to its new Academic Center at Largo in September 2009, and completed the process in 2010.    UMUC began offering on campus classes at its new Academic Center in the Spring 2010 semester.  Satellite campusesUMUC operates satellite campuses across the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, throughout Maryland, as well as in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Baltimore-Washington metropolitan areaIn the greater Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, daytime, evening and weekend classes are held at 21 locations, including holding many of its classes at the University of Maryland, College Park campus.  The satellite campuses offer varying academic services, including advising, computing, and library facilities (extensive library services are available to distance education students via the University's Information and Library Services department).UMUC operates a facility in Dorsey, Maryland adjacent to the Dorsey MARC Train Station.  In partnership with Maryland community colleges and other University System of Maryland institutions, UMUC offers courses and degree programs at several higher education centers throughout the state. In conjunction with the College of Southern Maryland, it operates the Waldorf Center for Higher Education in Waldorf, Maryland.  A consortium of universities led by Anne Arundel Community College, including UMUC, operates a higher education center adjacent to Arundel Mills mall in Hanover, Maryland.  In addition, the University offers courses at the Universities at Shady Grove and University System of Maryland at Hagerstown, which are part of the University System of Maryland. Global locationsIn Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, UMUC offers courses on military bases for service members, contractors, Federal employees, and their families.  In addition to distance learning via the Web, the university offers on-site, instructor-led classes at 130 overseas US military bases in 22 countries throughout the world.  Overseas instruction is coordinated through its European,  which covers USCENTCOM installations in the Middle East, and Asian  Divisions. UMUC divisional headquarters are located in Heidelberg, Germany near United States Army Garrison Heidelberg and on Yokota Air Base, Tokyo, Japan, respectively.   Student profileUMUC specializes in distance learning for adult, non-traditional students in Maryland, across the country, and around the world by operating satellite campuses and offering online instruction.  The university educates 50,000  active-duty service members at over 130 military installations.  In FY 2009, more than 30,000 Marylanders attended UMUC.   The USM Board of Regents predicts UMUC's enrollment will increase 48% by 2018. About three quarters of the undergraduate students attend part-time. Best Colleges | Find the Best College for You | US News Education   Over ninety-two percent of UMUC students are employed full-time.  The majority of undergraduate students are female.  The median age of stateside undergraduate students is 31.  Almost two-thirds of the graduate MBA students are married, half are female, and over a third are minorities.  Over a third of UMUC's stateside students were African-American, and this minority group earned over a third of the degrees awarded by the university.  AwardsIn 2011, UMUC received the Institution Award from the Council of College and Military Educators (CCME), a not-for-profit organization founded to promote, encourage and deliver quality education to servicemembers and their families in all branches of the U.S. armed services. The Institution Award is given to a college or university that supplies quality education programs to the armed services. CCME selected UMUC due to its dedication, leadership and numerous accomplishments in providing quality, voluntary off-duty education programs.

Cresaptown, Maryland   Cresaptown is a community located in Allegany County, Maryland, United States of America. It is an unincorporated community which, for United States Census Bureau purposes, is united with Bel Air to form the census-designated place of Cresaptown-Bel Air. Cresaptown's post office was established December 22, 1800.  Cresaptown is several miles southwest of Cumberland, Maryland. History Prior to 1728, Cresaptown was the site of a former Shawnee village along the Potomac River.  The inhabitants of this region were a portion of the Shawanese tribe, a sub-division of the Algonquian group, one of the most warlike combinations of that period. The warriors engaged in hunting and fishing for food and furs, while their families were left at home to tend the maize and grass that grew in the rich soil of the Potomac valley. The maize was ground into corn meal and made into Shawnee cake a popular diet of the Shawnees living in the valley. William Harrison Lowdermilk, "History of Cumberland, Md", Harvard University, 1878, page 19-20 The Shawanees in the valley lived in shelters composed of two forked posts that were driven into the ground and on these was laid a ridge pole.  small saplings, cut to a length of about eight feet, were laid against the pole, one end resting on the ground, forming a shelter similar to a V shaped tent.  This was covered with bark and skins and made tight enough to protect against rain or snow.  The floors were spread with furs, which made sure for seats or beds.  IndustryThe North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax prison facility, is located in Cresaptown.  The 372nd Military Police Company, known for participating in Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, is based here, though is slated to move to Grand Prairie, Texas.

Maryland railway station       Maryland railway station is located in Maryland, an area of Stratford, in the London Borough of Newham in east London, England. It was originally known as Maryland Point, and is just east of Stratford station in Travelcard Zone 3, on the Great Eastern Main Line. The station was first opened on 6 January 1873, and was fully rebuilt in 1891 when the line was quadrupled.  It adopted its current name on 28 October 1940. "News in Brief", The Times, 23 October 1940, p. 2.  Of the four platforms, only those serving the 'slow' lines are in regular operation, the 'fast' line platforms being used only when necessary during temporary train path diversions.The station is one of the primary rail access points for the residential areas in the north of Stratford and the south of Leytonstone in east London. The area surrounding the station has seen much redevelopment in recent years, with ongoing improvements underway related to the nearby Olympic Park.  Notably, the "Twisted Clock" timepiece/sculpture formerly installed outside Stratford Station has been relocated to Maryland.In May 2012, train operator Greater Anglia announced the start of a half-million pound investment programme for Maryland Station, including redecoration, re-roofing of platform canopies, and repairs to guttering.  Further upgrading of the station is expected in preparation for the arrival of Crossrail services in 2018. Train ServicesThe following services currently call at Maryland:  Operator Route Material Frequency Notes  Greater Anglia London Liverpool Street - Stratford - Maryland - Forest Gate - Manor Park - Ilford - Seven Kings - Goodmayes - Chadwell Heath - Romford - Gidea Park - Harold Wood - Brentwood - Shenfield Class 315 6x per hour               OlympicsDuring the 2012 London Olympics Maryland station would have been heavily used by fans who want to get into the venues in Stratford. As a result the Maryland Station will be closed between 27 July and 12 August 2012. Transport linksLondon Bus route 69, 257, 308 and night route N8. FutureMaryland station was added to the planned Crossrail route in August 2006, after campaigning by Newham Council, the London Transport Users Committee and others. The platforms are too short for Crossrail's ten-car trains, and cannot easily be lengthened due to physical contraints.  Nevertheless Crossrail has committed to providing a full service, making use of Selective Door Operation, such that doors on some end carriages will remain closed. An agreement was also reached about improving access to the station. Crossrail trains are due to replace the present Shenfield Metro service in 2018, which will result in a greatly increased range of direct destinations served by trains from Maryland. ServicesThe station is served by Greater Anglia metro services between   and  . Trains depart in each direction approximately every 10 minutes.

Hunt Valley, Maryland     Hunt Valley is an affluent unincorporated community in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States.  It lies just north of the city of Baltimore, along Highway 145 off Interstate 83. Loch Raven Reservoir. Located at a latitude of 39.5° North and longitude 76.7° West.  Hunt Valley is the home of Systems Alliance, Inc., BreakAway Games, Sinclair Broadcast Group, McCormick & Company, AAI Corporation, Dunbar (Armored Vehicles), TESSCO Technologies,  KCI Technologies, Inc. and ZeniMax Online Studios.  It was the former home of Noxell Corporation, makers of Noxzema, before Noxell was acquired by Procter & Gamble in the early 1990s. It was also the former home of  PHH and Firaxis Games, both of which now reside in Sparks, Maryland which is a few miles to the north of Hunt Valley. MicroProse, a leading video game developer from the 1980s, was originally based in Hunt Valley. The Hunt Valley Inn is the most popular hotel in Maryland for Science fiction conventions. Over the years it has hosted Balticon, Shore Leave, Horrorfind, Monster Mania, Nostalgia Con, FaerieCon, ClipperCon and Farpoint. Hunt Valley is served by the Cockeysville, Maryland post office, and also is home to a satellite campus of the Community College of Baltimore County.Many Baltimore County residents declaim that Hunt Valley doesn't actually exist—it is often grumbled that "Hunt Valley" is a fanciful name cooked up by real estate developers during the development of the area in the 1970s and 1980s; that is, "Hunt Valley" is more of a name brand than an actual place.  People of note  Sid Meier, Canadian video game designer   Public transportation Hunt Valley is well known in the Baltimore area as a result of its public transportation. It is the northern terminus of the Light Rail line, and is also served by the Route 9 bus. Only one-half of light rail trains operate to the Hunt Valley terminus, with the remainder only running as far as Timonium. The frequency of service is every 15 minutes all day daily and on weekends and holidays. Route 9 operates on an approximately 20 minute interval daily.  See   and          County, Maryland}}  
Loyola University Maryland     Loyola University Maryland is a Roman Catholic, Jesuit private university in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Established as Loyola College in Maryland by John Early and eight other members of the Society of Jesus in 1852, it is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities,  the ninth-oldest Jesuit college in the United States, and the first college in the United States to bear the name of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus.  Loyola's main campus is in Baltimore and features Collegiate Gothic architecture, as well as a pedestrian bridge across Charles Street.  Academically, the university is divided into three schools: the Loyola College of Arts and Sciences, the Loyola School of Education, and the Sellinger School of Business and Management. It operates a Clinical Center at Belvedere Square in Baltimore and has graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.The student body is composed of a little less than 4,000 undergraduate and 2,600 graduate students, representing 34 states and 20 countries, and 84% of undergraduates reside on campus. The average class size is 25, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1. Approximately 65% of the student body receives some form of financial aid. Campus groups include the Association of Latin American & Spanish students (ALAS) and the college newspaper, The Greyhound.Notable alumni include Tom Clancy, author of The Hunt for Red October, Mark Bowden, and author of Black Hawk Down. Loyola's sports teams are nicknamed the Greyhounds and are best known for the perennially ranked men's and women's lacrosse teams. The men's lacrosse team's biggest rival is nearby Johns Hopkins University. The annual lacrosse games played between these two institutions is known as the "Battle of Charles Street",  The school colors are green and grey.  History  Founding Loyola College in Maryland was founded in 1852 by John Early and eight other members of the Society of Jesus, and was the first college in the United States to bear the name of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Loyola College in Maryland is the ninth-oldest among the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges and universities.The college's first campus was on Holliday Street in downtown Baltimore. In 1855, Loyola relocated to a larger facility in the city's historic Mount Vernon neighborhood, and moved to its present Evergreen campus in north Baltimore in 1922. Evening classes commenced in 1942. ExpansionIn 1949, the college established a graduate division in education, adding a graduate degree program in business management in 1968, a graduate program in speech pathology in 1971, and finance in 1973. Today, the college's list of graduate programs has grown to include psychology, modern studies, pastoral counseling, computer science, and software engineering.Loyola became coeducational in 1971, following its joining with Mount Saint Agnes College, a neighboring women's college that was experiencing financial difficulties and closed following the joining. That same year, the college's Board of Trustees elected its first lay chairperson.Working from these foundations, Loyola has transformed itself from a small, commuter college into a residential college with an undergraduate population of more than 3,000 students. In 1981, Loyola established a separate business school: The Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, Jr., School of Business and Management. The school would expand geographically with two graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland. Designation changeThe Executive Committee of the college's Board of Trustees announced on August 20, 2008 its decision to change the institution's name to Loyola University Maryland.  Its request was approved on March 25, 2009 by the Maryland Higher Education Commission, with the change officially taking effect five months later on August 19.    The Reverend Brian F. Linnane, the university's president, stated that the "college" designation no longer fit the school and that its comprehensive array of academic fields, some with graduate programs, was better reflected in its new name. Some alumni were disappointed because they felt the change made the institution less distinct from Loyola University Chicago, Loyola University New Orleans and Loyola Marymount University.  Jesuit tradition  Loyola University Maryland was founded by the Society of Jesus in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola.      The Society of Jesus, and therefore Loyola University Maryland, operate according to the mandate Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (AMDG), directing their ends toward that which brings forth the "greater glory of God". This cornerstone of the Jesuit philosophy functions to remind students that their education is meant to be applied toward the betterment of humanity and the worship of God, in particular. Loyola's focus on cura personalis, or the education of the whole person, functions to attain that end. A broad base of knowledge, supported by a strong liberal arts core, prepares Jesuit students to undertake the goal of AMDG.In keeping with this overarching principle, Loyola undergraduates must complete the core curriculum which includes courses in English, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, natural science, and social sciences.  Though Loyola encourages plurality, its religious heritage is preserved and cultured by encouraging all of its students and faculty to cultivate and live by the core values of the Society of Jesus.In 1950, Loyola was awarded the Sidney Hollander Award for its contribution to the establishment of civil and political rights for African Americans in Maryland.  EndowmentLoyola's endowment operates under the umbrella of "Preparing Tomorrow: The Campaign for Loyola College Maryland."   The endowment mainly supports academic programs and scholarships.  Major contributions include a $1 million grant from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation to increase enrollment of low income students.  By June 2005, the campaign reached $93 million.  Academic programsThe foundation of a Loyola education is a broad core program that covers basic knowledge and concepts in the humanities, math and science, and the social sciences. The purpose is to balance general education and specialized study in the major. Undergraduate degrees are awarded in three schools, Loyola College, the School of Education, and the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management. The university operates on a semester system.  Loyola CollegeCoinciding with the university's transition to its new name, the College of Arts and Sciences became Loyola College on August 19, 2009.  It offers degrees in biology, chemistry, classics, communication, comparative cultures and literary studies, computer science, economics, education, engineering science, English, fine arts, French, German, global studies, history, an honors program, interdisciplinary studies (including American, Asian, Catholic, film, gender, Latin American/Latino and medieval studies), law, mathematical science, military career, modern languages and literatures, nursing, philosophy, physics, political science, pre-health curriculum/programs (including medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and optometry/podiatry), psychology, sociology, Spanish, speech-language pathology/audiology, theology, and writing. Sellinger School of Business and Management   The Sellinger School of Business and Management offers degrees in accounting, business economics, finance, general business, international business, management, management information systems, marketing, and the Sellinger scholars program. In 1984 the business school was formally named the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management in honor of the late Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger, earning accreditation in all programs by AACSB (The International Association for Management Education) in 1988. Loyola is the only private institution in the state of Maryland with a nationally accredited business school.  In 1990, the accounting department earned specialized national accreditation from AACSB.  School of EducationSince 1946 the department of education has been one of the stronger academic pillars at Loyola. With the 2009 name designation change, President Linnane announced the opening of The School of Education which was to be led by Peter C. Murell, Jr. as the first dean. The School was officially opened on October 14, 2009.  The School now offers undergraduate majors in Elementary Education and minors in Secondary Education and Special Education. Its graduate department offers Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (M.Ed.), the Certificate of Advanced Study in School Management (C.S.M.), and the Certificate of Advanced Study in Education (CASE). Admission   More than 10,000 students apply for admission as freshmen for approximately 1,000 spaces. Strong grade performance is particularly emphasized in Loyola’s admission evaluation. Loyola students typically have achieved a 3.5 grade point average in their high school work, and are evaluated based on the rigor of their high school curriculum. The class of 2013 was the last applicant class that was required to submit SAT scores. The admission office has now begun a four-year pilot program that does not require standardized test scores, deeming them optional.

In addition, Loyola has two satellite campuses in Timonium and Columbia for graduate classes. The college also owns   in the mountains of western Maryland, used for the Rising Phoenix Retreat Center. The Loyola Clinical Centers are located just a short drive from the college’s main campus, in Belvedere Square. The Clinical Centers offer individuals in the community a broad range of services addressing educational, language, and psychological issues.At the western side of the Quad on the Evergreen campus lies the Alumni Memorial Chapel. Formally dedicated on September 15, 1952, the chapel features Gothic architectural influences with large stained-glass windows and a long, narrow nave situated along the east-west axis. A statue of Our Lady of Evergreen, Queen of Peace, is situated above the front façade.On the eastern side of the Quad, and in the center of campus, is the Tudor-style Humanities Center, originally built by the Garrett family in 1895 as a wedding gift for one of their children. Unfortunately, the child died during a trip to England, and the residence became a rehabilitation center for men blinded during the war. In 1921, Loyola's Jesuits purchased the Evergreen property from the Garretts and gradually moved the college from its location on Calvert Street. The mansion was originally used for classes, but then became the Jesuit residence. In 1955, it suffered severe fire damage and was converted to offices following the restoration. Today, the Humanities Center houses 16 departments, including Admissions, Alumni Relations, Financial Aid and the Philosophy, Theology, and History departments.In the northern side of the Quad lies the Sellinger School of Business and Management, which opened in January 2000. The   facility features a more contemporary style, with Spanish influences, including a soaring, five-story glass façade, open atrium, a four-story glass tower, and three seminar rooms.On the southern side of the Quad lies Beatty Hall, Jenkins Hall, and Xavier Hall. Each of these buildings, used to house classrooms and various departments, is heavily influenced by Gothic and Edwardian architectural styles.The dormitories housing students are located west of the main campus, and are connected by Loyola's pedestrian bridge (or USF&G Pedestrian Bridge), spanning Charles Street. Loyola's dormitories, in most cases purchased apartment buildings, include Newman Towers, Campion Tower, and Seton Court. Further up North Charles Street is the Fitness and Aquatic Center, which opened in fall 2000, featuring a   fitness center with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, stair climbers, free weights, selectorized weight circuit and stretching area. The Mangione Aquatic Center features an eight-lane,   swim course; a shallow lane and diving well; as well as an on-deck sauna and hot tub. The   indoor rock climbing wall and bouldering area is designed for all levels. The FAC also has a two-court gymnasium used for club sports, intramural sports, and informal recreation. The Multi-Activity Court features a sport court surface ideal for indoor soccer, volleyball, and inline sports. The FAC also features an elevated walking/jogging track, two group exercise studios, an Outdoor Adventure Center, classroom and conference room, an equipment room, locker rooms, four racquetball and two squash courts, and an outdoor grass field.Loyola shares with the Notre Dame of Maryland University (formerly College of Notre Dame of Maryland) the Loyola Notre Dame Library, located between the two schools, and features a   interior; interactive study and instructional spaces; an exhibition area and curatorial space for special collections; expanded stack areas for humanities print collection; a café fully wired for voice, data, and video; five high-tech seminar rooms; digital studio for collaborative student and faculty projects; a media center with 96-seat auditorium; and a 24-seat, fully wired bibliographic classroom.  SustainabilityThe University employs a full-time administrator and several student staff members dedicated to advancing sustainability on campus.    Two roof-top solar panels were installed during the summer of 2008, and a green residence hall features recycled metal beams, a green roof, and geothermal heating and cooling. The student groups  Environmental Action Club, Roots and Shoots, and Justice Club work to promote environmental stewardship and sustainability on campus. Loyola also partners with a hybrid-only taxi service to provide additional transportation resources. Student lifeLoyola's undergraduate body is composed of 3,580 students as of 2008. The racial diversity of the undergraduate student body was 85.0% white, 2.7% Asian, 5.1% black, and 3.4% Hispanic. Ninety-eight percent of freshmen and 81% of all undergraduate students live in college housing. Loyola has more than 150 clubs and organizations, catering to a range of interests.

ALANA (African, Latino, Asian and Native American) Student Services provides an array of activities to foster the academic, cultural, personal, spiritual, and leadership development of ALANA students, as well as create and maintain an environment of respect and awareness.Loyola's ROTC is an elective course taken along with a student’s required college courses. Students take one class and one lab each week, plus physical fitness training three times per week. Courses cover everything from the structure of the Army to military operations and tactics. Upon completion of the program, cadets are commissioned as officers in the U.S. Army and must complete a period of service in either the Active Duty, Army Reserve or Army National Guard. Since its inception in 1952, the ROTC program has commissioned more than 1,100 cadets. Loyola's Army ROTC program has a partnership with Towson University, the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, and Goucher College.More than half of the student population has participated in some community service activity during their time at Loyola. The Center for Community Service and Justice engages students by developing service opportunities in a wide variety of areas. The center offers nearly 40 ongoing community service programs, more than 15 one-time service opportunities throughout the year, and several immersion programs. Students also have an opportunity to become involved through service learning, which pairs community service with academic coursework.Sixty-five percent of Loyola's undergraduate students studied abroad during their junior year.    Students can choose from 21 different programs, exchanges, and affiliations in 16 countries.  Loyola-sponsored programs include Alcala, Spain; Auckland, New Zealand; Bangkok, Thailand; Beijing, China; Cork, Ireland; Leuven, Belgium; Melbourne, Australia; Newcastle, England; Paris, France; and Rome, Italy. Programs are available for all majors, and students have the option of going for one semester or the entire year. Some programs are taught in English, some in the native language, and some a combination of both.

Suitland, Maryland   Suitland is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George's County, Maryland, about   southeast of Washington, D.C. As of the 2010 census, the population of the CDP was 25,825.    Prior to 2010, Suitland was part of the Suitland-Silver Hill census-designated place.The community was named for 19th century landowner and businessman, State Senator Samuel Taylor Suit, whose estate, "Suitland," was located near the current intersection of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads.    GeographyAs an unincorportaed area, Suitland's boundaries are not officially defined.  The U.S. Geological Survey locates the center of Suitland at 38°50'49"N 76°55'33"W.   This area is roughly bounded by Southern Avenue (D.C. Line) to the north, Branch Avenue (MD 5) to the west, Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) to the east, and Donnell Drive/Suitland Parkway/Meadowbrook Drive (Henson Creek) to the south. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland has a total area of  , a 25% reduction from the 5.6 sq. mi. used in previous years.   While the Census Bureau defines the CDP as all land, the Suitland Bog and portions of Henson Creek, a tributary of the Potomac, are located off of Suitland Parkway near the southern border of the CDP.  Suitland Bog is one of the last of the natural bogs in the D.C. region, which numbered around thirty before the onset of suburban development.     This wetland ecosystem features sweet bay magnolias and other rare species of plants, including northern pitcher-plants, lady slipper orchids, sundews, and sphagnum moss. Parks and RecreationThere are two community recreation centers (Bradbury Heights Recreation Center and William Beanes Community Center) and 4 parks (Auth Village Neighborhood Park, Douglas Patterson Community Park, Dupont Heights Neighborhood Park, and Michael J. Polley Neighborhood Park) maintained by the Prince George's County Department of Parks and Recreation.  Demographics  2010Note: For the 2010 Census the boundaries of the Suitland CDP were changed reducing the land area by approx. 25%. As a result, the population count for 2010 shows a 22.9% decrease, with a population density increase of 4%. As of the 2010 census, there were 25,825 people and 10,139 households residing in the Suitland CDP.  The population density was 6148 people per square mile. There were 10,805 housing units at an average density of 2572 per square mile. The racial makeup of the community was 91.9% African American, 2.6% White, 0.4% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 4.7% Latino, 1.7% from other races, and 2.1% from two or more races. There were 10,139 households out of which 3,682 were households with no family and 6,457 were identified as household with families.  Of those households, 30.9% were married couples living together, 32.4% had a female householder, and 9% had a male householder.  The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 3.19.In the census area, the population was spread out with 23.9% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 17.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.5 years. The median income for a household in the census area was $56,217, and the median income for a family was $61.393.  The per capita income for the area was $26,040. 7.4% (+/- 2.0%) of the population and 6.5% (+/-2.4%) of families were below the poverty line.

European settlers established their first Maryland colony on Saint Clement's Island (renamed Saint Mary's City) in 1694, and by the 1660s-1680s, settlers had moved into what is now known as Prince Georges County.  Faced with this encroachment, the Piscataways left the area in 1697, moving north to what is now known as Conoy Island, and eventually moving further north into Pennsylvania and Michigan.  The sole export of the incoming settlers was tobacco, and slaves were first brought to the county in the 1700s. Nineteenth centuryPrior to the Civil War, as a result of tobacco production, Prince Georges County was one of the wealthiest counties in Maryland and half of the county's population were slave.   After the war, old plantations were broken up and replaced by communities of centered around small farming and country villages.In 1867, Samuel Taylor Suit moved to Maryland and purchased more than 800 acres near Washington, D.C.   In the 1870s-1880s, the Suitland estate was visited by prominent guests, including U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, and was the site where an international tribunal of representatives settled negotiations for the 1871 Alabama claims.  After Suit's death in 1888, portions of the estate were sold (circa 1892-1903) to William A. Harrison, and the land was subsequently subdivided and sold over the years.  Suit's son, Arthur B. Suit, retained 3 acres of land near the corner of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads, where he maintained a general store, bar, bowling alley, and the community's one-room jailhouse.  Twentieth centuryBy the turn of the century, the village of Suitland had added a post office, churches, and several houses.   On August 10, 1909, local residents met at the home of George J. Hess and organized the Suitland Improvement Association of Maryland to raise funds for a community meeting hall.  Three officers were elected to serve one year posts: President - Dr. C.M. Emmons; Vice President - C.L. Jenkins; and Secretary and Treasurer, George J. Hess.  The Association was incorporated on November 17, 1950 and is now known as the Suitland Civic Association. There are two historic cemeteries in Suitland, Cedar Hill and Lincoln Memorial.   Cedar Hill Cemetery was founded in 1901 and built on the former Nonesuch Plantation.  Prior to 1913, it was known as Forest Lake Cemetery and was likely renamed after the cedar trees that lined both sides of Suitland Road from the D.C. line to Silver Hill Road.  Early churches performed baptisms at this location and it is also the burial site for victims of the 1906 Terra Cotta Railroad wreck.   Lincoln Memorial Cemetery was founded in 1927 on the former Landon dairy farm and is the site where many prominent African-Americans are buried.  Individuals include Dr. Charles Richard Drew, who established improved techniques for blood storage and developed large scale blood banks early in World War II, and Nannie Helen Burroughs, educator and civil rights activist. The first one-room schoolhouse was built in 1891 on land purchased by the community.  A two-room schoolhouse was later built in 1915 on Silver Hill Road, expanded to four rooms in 1922, and saw additions to the building in 1928, 1941, and 1957. Property owned by James West and Joseph Friday, located near the current intersection of Swann and Silver Hill Roads, was used as an airfield from 1938 to 1941.   Named "Skyhaven" by a local student who won the naming contest sponsored by West and Friday, Skyhaven Airfield hosted a flying club that served 20 small planes, including Wacos, Great Lakes, and Pipers.Suitland remained a rural farming community until the onset of World War II.  To meet the need for additional office space to support the war effort, in September 1941, the Public Buildings Administration awarded a $2,749,000 contract to McCloskey and Co. of Philadelphia to develop a new federal office building in Prince Georges County, Maryland.     Later that year, 437 acres of farm and dairy land were purchased in Suitland to build the Suitland Federal Center.  The 12 existing residences on this property included the former dairy and summer home of Albert Carry, the German-American founder of the National Capital Brewing Company and the Carry Ice Cream Co.  The Suitland House, built by Lowell O. Minear, a pioneer designer of memorial parks, is the sole remaining residence on the Federal Center property.  A colonial-revival style home, it now serves as office space for the U.S. Census Bureau and is included in the Prince Georges County Planning Department's 2010 Approved Historic Sites and Districts Plan. In 1942, the Suitland Manor apartments were built in anticipation of new federal workers.  Parkway Terrace, Whitehall Square, and Marlborough House developments soon followed to accommodate the influx of Census Bureau and other federal employees.  In 1943, the Census Bureau turned 14 acres of land at the Federal Center site into the largest Victory Garden in the Washington metropolitan area.   The land was a parceled into 616 plots and plowed, fertilized, and tended by census employees.  As late as 1989, 110 garden plots were still available for summer rental on a first come, first serve basis for $7.00 each.  These gardens were located at the site of the current Navel Intelligence Building.In 1944, the Suitland Parkway was opened to connect the Army's Bolling Air Force Base (Bolling Field) to the Camp Springs Army Military Reservation, now known as Andrews Air Force Base.   The   of highway, originally named the Fighter Command Station Access Parkway, was initially limited to military use only and came under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in 1949.Suitland Junior-Senior High School, was the first high school in Suitland.   The building was dedicated on November 15, 1951 to the high ideal of freedom of education, with John W. McNamara presiding as master-of-ceremonies and principal Thomas Warthen accepting the dedication on behalf of the students and faculty.The 1950s-1960s were a period of major growth for Suitland, as new middle and working class families settled into the newly built residential communities.  However, this population boom came to an end around 1970 due to several converging factors.  These include the availability of cheaper land and lower taxes in neighboring county jurisdictions; the ending of the postwar baby boom; the slowdown in the rate of federal government growth; and migration patterns spurred by school busing mandates leading to regional demographic shifts.   The 1970s were both the beginning of a period of population adjustment and a recognition of Suitland's unique local history.  Beginning in 1973, Prince Georges County became the largest school district to adopt a busing plan after the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education.   The demographic changes caused by desegregation busing changed the county, transforming a great number of neighborhoods that were formerly middle-class and white to black and upper-middle class, and these shifts are reflected in the current population demographic of the Suitland CDP.In 1975, local historian Darlene Norton was elected to draft a local history of the township in preparation for Suitland's centennial celebration.    A History of Suitland, Maryland, 1867-1976 (1976) includes a detailed history of early residents, businesses, land purchases, and the development of Suitland civic, public, and private enterprises.  That same year, local resident Walter Coley organized a committee within the Suitland Citizen's Association to preserve the Suitland Bog, which led to the purchase of 20 acres of woods and wetland by the Maryland National Capitol Park and Planning Commission.   In the 1980s, crime associated with vandalism, property violations, landlord absenteeism, and drugs were seen as a threat to the federal workers who were now commuting into Suitland from outside the community, and in 1983, a razor wired fence was erected around the Federal Center complex.     Through most of this decade, neighborhoods near the Federal Center remained distressed and in need of a plan for positive change and growth.In the mid-1990s, county executive Wayne Curry conceived a plan to revitalize Suitland as part of a greater county-wide effort to improve townships located inside the Beltway.   In 1997, as the first stage of the Prince Georges County Redevelopment Authority project to revitalize the site, the Manchester Square housing development was turned over to the county.  Two years later, the fence surrounding the Federal Center was replaced with a regular wrought iron fence. Twenty-first centuryThe Suitland Metro, an extension of the Washington Metro Transit Authority's Green Line, opened to the public January 13, 2001.In 2004, Windsor Crossing, a $45 million multifamily condominium complex built by Stavrou Associates in partnership with the Prince Georges Redevelopment Authority, was completed on the former Manchester Square development.   In 2005, the $15.7 million Suitland Elementary School was opened to the public as part of the revitalization plan.   The Redevelopment Authority is currently planning on developing the 22-acre Suitland Manor site into a mixed-use Town Center project.In 2006, multi-million dollar federal renovations of the U.S. Census Building and National Oceanic and Atmospheric headquarters were completed.  Major renovations were also completed at the the Spauldings Branch Library in 2012, which serves Suitland and surrounding communities.In addition, two revitalization projects were detailed to the public in 2012, the Buy Suitland initiative and the Green Suitland Neighborhood Stabilization Project.  The Buy Suitland initiative offers up to 5% purchase price to first time home buyers, up to 7% purchase price to local civic workers, or 35% of purchase price or $40,000 to debt-to-income candidates for properties located in 11 census tracts.  Green Suitland NSP is allocating over $2 million dollars for the purchase of foreclosed and abandoned homes to be rehabilitated with enviro-friendly, cost-saving upgrades before they are offered up for resale.  TransportationThe major roads in Suitland are mostly 2-3 lane highways.  Suitland Parkway runs through the entirety of the Suitland CDP, and the Capital Beltway can be accessed from Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) and Branch Avenue (MD 5).  The community is served by the Washington Metro Suitland station (Green Line), located at the intersection of Silver Hill Road and Suitland Parkway.

One of 15 counties that comprise the first-level of administrative division in the nation, it has two districts. Harper serves as the capital with the area of the county measuring  .  As of the 2008 Census, it had a population of 136,404, making it the seventh most populous county in Liberia.     Named after the State of Maryland in the United States, it was an independent country as the Republic of Maryland from 1854 until it joined Liberia in 1857. The most populous city in the county is Pleebo with 22,963 residents, while Maryland's County Superintendent is J. Gblebo Brown.   The county is bordered by Grand Kru County to the west and River Gee County to the north. The eastern part of Maryland borders the nation of Côte d'Ivoire, separated by the Cavalla River. HistoryMaryland was first established as a colony of the Maryland State Colonization Society 1834,  but was not granted independence until 1854. Following a referendum in 1853, the colony declared its independence from the Colonization Society and formed the Republic of Maryland. It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro Rivers. In 1856, the independent state of Maryland (Africa) requested military aid from Liberia in a war with the Grebo and Kru peoples who were resisting the Maryland settlers' efforts to control their trade in slaves. President Roberts assisted the Marylanders, and a joint military campaign by both groups of Americo-Liberian colonists resulted in victory. Following a referendum in February 1857 the Republic of Maryland joined Liberia as Maryland County on 6 April 1857. As of May 2004, a DRC census estimated the county's population to be 107,100.

Wilde Lake, Columbia, Maryland Wilde Lake is a reservoir and also the name of the surrounding neighborhood, or "village", located in Columbia, Maryland, just north and west of the Columbia Town Center.   It was the first portion of the "New Town" of Columbia to be built during the late 1960s, and was occupied in 1967. Mitchell, pp. 58, 79-81, 151   The lake and village are named for Frazar B. Wilde, a past chairman of the board of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. "The Neighborhoods of Wilde Lake", columbiamaryland.com, accessed May 29, 2009   In 1963, the company agreed to invest in the project and, in return, acquired an equity participation. This arrangement was subsequently formalized by the creation of The Howard Research and Development Corporation, the joint venture established to develop Columbia. Kimco Realty Corporation, the current owner of the village center, proposed a controversial redevelopment plan in 2008, that would have torn down buildings and built a large number of apartments in a mixed-use project.  A Kimco executive declared that plan to be "null and void" at a June 1, 2009 meeting.  The vice-president of Acquisitions and Development said: "I have no idea what the concept is [now]."   NeighborhoodsNeighborhoods in the Village of Wilde Lake include: Bryant Woods (named for William Cullen Bryant), Faulkner Ridge (named for William Faulkner), Running Brook (where the streets are named for Robert Frost's poems and Aesop's Fables) (The Birches is located within Running Brook).  ServicesThe village center is located in the Wilde Lake Village Green, and has a small grocery store, various restaurants, and other retail establishments.   The Wilde Lake Community Center, called Slayton House, was named for John Slayton, first manager of the Columbia Association. The Wilde Lake Interfaith Center is located in the village center.  EducationWilde Lake High School, alma mater of actor (and grandson of Columbia founder James W. Rouse) Edward Norton,    is located in the Village of Wilde Lake. Wilde Lake High School was the first high school to open in Columbia in 1971. It was the "first in the country to use individual study 'learning activities packages' for self-paced learning." The school has 3 stories with skylights, and open hallways that overlook a central hallway nicknamed "Main Street." It is home to The Jim Rouse Theater, which houses performing arts performances for both the school's programs and for organizations throughout Columbia. The school is well known for its performing arts program. "Wilde Lake High School Profile, 2008-2009", www.hcpss.org, accessed May 29, 2009  Wexler, Kathryn. "New Beginning For Old School; Rebuilt Wilde Lake Opens to Raves", The Washington Post, August 29, 1996, WEEKLY - MD; Pg. M01 The original high school was demolished in 1996 and a new one constructed.  The former design was oval and two stories, with a windowless doughnut layout with classroom clusters,  and a media center located in the center and accessible from the second level.  Other schools in the Village of Wilde Lake include Bryant Woods, Running Brook, and Faulkner Ridge elementary schools, and Wilde Lake Middle School.  RecreationThe Columbia Swim Center, which contains three indoor pools and a water slide called "Splashdown," is located in the village center.   There are also outdoor pools in each neighborhood. The walking path around the   lake is   long.  References  Notes  Mitchell, Joseph Rocco and Stebenne, David.

USS Maryland (1799)    {Infobox Ship Image}}      USS Maryland was a sloop in the United States Navy. She served during the Quasi-War with France.Maryland was built by public subscription in Baltimore under the Act of 30 June 1798; launched at Price Shipyard, Baltimore, 3 June 1799; and accepted by the Navy in August 1799, Capt. John Rodgers in command.Maryland departed Baltimore 13 September 1799 for the Surinam station. Arriving 1 October, the sloop cruised from French Guiana to Curaçao protecting American shipping from attacks by French warships and privateers. The Napoleonic Wars were ongoing in Europe and the French were searching and seizing merchant vessels trading with the British West Indies, causing much loss to American commerce. Maryland captured the schooner Clarissa, an American slave trader without papers 4 January 1800, and then on 26 July fell in with and recaptured without a fight the Portuguese brig Gloria da Mar, which had been captured by French privateer Cherry only 13 days previous.The sloop left Surinam for home 9 August 1800, having served since December 1799 as the only American naval vessel on the Surinam station. Sailing by way of St. Kitts, and St. Thomas, Maryland escorted a large convoy of American and British merchant vessels to safe waters, in addition to capturing Aerial, an American merchantman without papers, 2 September.She arrived Baltimore 1 October for repairs. Maryland departed Baltimore 22 March 1801 with Congressman John Dawson of Virginia, President Adams’ designated bearer of the amended and ratified Treaty of Mortefontaine with France, and arrived Havre de Grâce, France, in early May. The sloop remained until 15 July, when, because of difficulties in obtaining ratification, she was released by Congressman Dawson and sent home. Carrying several diplomatic passengers and important letters and dispatches, she returned to her home port Baltimore 28 August. Captain Rodgers discharged the crew and then sold Maryland 2 October 1801 for $20,200. References           
USS Maryland (SSBN-738)    USS Maryland (SSBN-738) {Infobox ship image}}     USS Maryland (SSBN-738) is a United States Navy   ballistic missile submarine. Maryland is the 13th of 18 of the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, and has been in commission since 1992.Maryland is the fourth United States Navy vessel to be named after the U.S. state of Maryland. Her mission is to provide the United States of America with an undetectable and unattackable nuclear launch platform in support of the national strategy of strategic deterrence.     Construction and commissioningThe contract for the construction of the Maryland was awarded on 14 March 1986. Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation at Groton, Connecticut, on 22 April 1986. Christening ceremony and launchingMaryland was christened and launched in a ceremony on 10 August 1991 at the Electric Boat shipyard. The program opened with the U.S. national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner", performed by the United States Navy Band, Northeast, led by Chief Musician Steven R. Rawson. Mr. Roger E. Tetrault, Vice President and General Manager of Electric Boat Division, then gave welcoming remarks. Mr. James E. Turner, Jr., Executive Vice President of Marine, Land Systems and Services, General Dynamics Corporation, also gave prepared remarks for the occasion. The director of the Maryland Veterans Commission, Clarence M. Bacon, greeted guests and crew, then turned over the podium to Vice Admiral Kenneth C. Malley, Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command. Vice Admiral Henry G. Chiles, Jr., Commander Submarine Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet, introduced the principal speaker, The Honorable Helen Delich Bentley U.S. Representative for Maryland's Second Congressional District. Mr. James E. Turner Jr. then returned to the podium to introduce the sponsor, Sarah "Sally" Craig Larson. After a short blessing of the ship by Captain A. Byron Holderby, Ms. Larson, along with Matron of Honor Kirsten L. Datko and Maid of Honor Erica L. Larson, christened pre-commissioning unit Maryland, and Maryland was launched. CommissioningOn 13 June 1992, the PCU Maryland was formally commissioned into U.S. Naval service as the USS Maryland, with Captain John W. Francis in command of the Blue crew and Captain Harold E. Marshall in command of the Gold crew.     The principal speaker was Admiral Charles R. Larson, Commander-in-Chief U.S. Pacific Command.At this point the Blue crew retained the ship for shakedown operations, while the Gold crew departed to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Kings Bay, Georgia to start their offcrew training cycle. Service historyMaryland departed Groton for Kings Bay on 15 June 1992 and immediately started preparation for strategic certification, with the Blue crew achieving a successful test launch on 29 Jul 1992, and starting Trident D-5 missile Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO) on 7 July 1992. The first exchange of command occurred on 4 September 1992, with the Gold crew taking charge of Maryland, and completing their phase of DASO on 22 October 1992. Various other inspections and training exercises were conducted throughout 1992. The Blue crew relieved the Gold crew 26 January 1993 and continued with preparations for strategic certification. Maryland returned to Groton on 30 January 1993 for post-shakedown maintenance prior to assuming responsibility for strategic deterrent patrols. Maryland returned to Kings Bay, Georgia on 9 April 1993.    Maryland completed various weapons and tactical certifications and then returned to Kings Bay on 4 May 1993 to join Submarine Squadron 20 and commence preparations for the first strategic deterrent patrol. The initial loadout of Trident D-5 missiles was completed at this point. The Gold crew relieved the Blue crew 7 May 1993 and continued the refit. On 19 June 1993 Maryland went underway on her first strategic deterrent patrol, which started her strategic patrol cycle.  GroundingOn 24 September 1993, Maryland ran aground at Port Canaveral, Florida, after conducting a medical evacuation of an ill crew member, and returned to Kings Bay to inspect for damage. Damage to the submarine was minimal, and the investigation found that the crew was not responsible. Maryland then resumed her second deterrent patrol on 26 September 1993.  Crew member deathOn 5 May 2002, ETC (SS) LeRoy W. Young, USN, died of a heart attack while deployed on Maryland. His funeral was held while she was in port, 12 May 2002, and the ship resumed its patrol shortly afterwards.     Trident SLBM Missile TestingMaryland has been involved in several Follow-on Commander's Evaluation Tests (FCET) of its Trident D-5 SLBM missile system. The FCET launches a specially modified missile without a nuclear payload, and is used to test the performance of the Trident missile system.  FCET 10, performed 3 January 1994. 4 missiles launched.          FCET 14, performed 21 April 1996. 2 missiles launched.       FCET 21, performed 26 April 1999. 2 missiles launched.

Symbolism of the USS Maryland insigniaDark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the United States Navy. The arms of Maryland hail the state's historical roots, while the submarine indicates the present-day USS Maryland is an Ohio-class submarine. The trident represents U.S. Navy weaponry and sea prowess; its bottom spike points to the ocean depths, the area of Maryland s operations. The heraldic dolphins symbolize speed, intelligence, and the ability to penetrate the deep. The laurel wreath is emblematic of excellence and accomplishment; its seven stars commemorate both the seven battle stars that battleship   earned in World War II and that the state of Maryland was the seventh state to be admitted to the Union. SealMarylands coat of arms is emblazoned upon a white oval enclosed by a blue collar edged on the outside with gold rope and is inscribed in gold letters with the words "USS Maryland" above, and "SSBN-738" below. BlazonThe shield features the arms of the state of Maryland, which historically derives from the quartered arms of the Calvert and Crossland families. Its main color is blue, highlighted with silver. Beneath the shield is a scroll in blue, displaying the motto Timete Deum Solum et Ignominiam ("Fear Only God and Dishonor") inscribed in gold letters. This is all superimposed upon a trident wreathed in laurel decorated with seven stars. The trident's bottom spike is flanked by two dolphins. In popular culture  In the 1994 Tom Clancy novel, Debt of Honor, Maryland is one of several submarines sent to deal with a Japanese invasion of the Northern Mariana Islands. In the 1998 television film Ice, Maryland is sent to evacuate VIPs from the frozen West Coast of the United States after the coastline has become ice-bound, preventing surface vessels from approaching the shore.

Wicomico River (Maryland eastern shore)  The Wicomico River   is a   U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011  tributary of the Chesapeake Bay on the eastern shore of Maryland. It drains an area of low marshlands and farming country in the middle Delmarva Peninsula. The name "Wicomico" derives from the words wicko mekee, meaning "a place where houses are built," apparently referring to an Indian town on the banks. The river is one of two in Maryland with this same name, along with the Wicomico River (a tributary of the Potomac River) in south central Maryland.It rises in northern Wicomico County, close to the Delaware state line, and flows generally southwest, through Salisbury, its head of navigation. It enters Monie Bay on the eastern edge of the Chesapeake Bay between Mt. Vernon and Waterview approximately   southwest of Salisbury. The lower   of the river form a tidal estuary.The gentle free-flowing river is a popular destination for recreational canoeing and kayaking, as well as recreational fishing. The river has also become a hot spot for water sports such as wake boarding and water skiing due to its consistently smooth surface. Barge traffic on the river has made Salisbury the primary shipping points for goods on the Delmarva Peninsula over the last several centuries. Two automobile cable ferries cross the river at the at Whitehaven and Upper Ferry.  References  External links  The Wicomico River

Western Maryland   Western Maryland is the portion of the U.S. state of Maryland that traditionally consists of Washington, Allegany, and Garrett counties. Frederick County is also sometimes included, despite being part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The region is bounded by the Mason-Dixon line to the north, Preston County, West Virginia to the west, and the Potomac River to the south. There is dispute over the eastern boundary of Western Maryland.  For most residents of the Baltimore-Washington area, everything west of Frederick city is considered Western Maryland. However, the people of the more mountainous and isolated Allegany County and Garrett County consider Sideling Hill the boundary between Western Maryland and what they refer to as "down-state." According to the Census Bureau's 2007 dataset, Western Maryland (including Washington and Frederick counties) has a population of 472,039, accounting for 8.4% of the population of Maryland. Its land area is  , or 22.45% percent of the state's land area. Only 21.7% of Western Maryland's residents live in the geographically isolated Allegany and Garrett counties; the other 78.3% live in suburban Frederick and Washington counties. Western Maryland is much more rural than the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, where most of the state's population lives; even Frederick and Washington counties are less urbanized than places closer to Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.  Many people still perform a variety of subsistence agriculture for their food needs, and there are relatively few towns larger than 10,000 people. Western Maryland is noted for its idyllic rural landscapes in its eastern portion and the mountainous terrain in Allegany and Garrett Counties. The area is generally regarded as part of Appalachia,   with the extreme western section having more of an affinity to Pittsburgh than the rest of the state. Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties are part of the Appalachian Regional Commission. Garrett County, the state's westernmost county, largely aligns itself through marketing and sports with West Virginia and the Pittsburgh area rather than Maryland.The climate of cities west of Frederick is more akin to the mountains of northern West Virginia than to any other part of Maryland. Summers tend to be much cooler than in the rest of the state, and winters harsher. Temperatures in winter often drop to near or below 0 F (-18°C), and snowfall averages from 20 inches farther east to over 120 inches in the higher elevations. Comparably, Prince George's County, in the eastern part of the Washington, D.C. area, averages only 25 inches of snow and wintertime temperatures many times exceed 50 F (10°C).Western Maryland has a heavily agricultural economy. Its best-known crops are the apples grown in the Cumberland Valley, but corn, potatoes, beans, and varieties of green-leaf vegetables are grown as well. Mixed crop and livestock farms are common, and the region has a large number of dairy cattle farms. There is however, a thriving tourist industry, and places such as Deep Creek Lake in Garrett County are frequented by many visitors every year. Garrett County is also well known for its numerous state parks and outdoor activities. Maryland's only ski resort, Wisp Ski Resort, is located in Garrett County near Oakland. Major communities  Boonsboro Brunswick Cumberland Emmitsburg Frostburg Hagerstown Hancock Middletown Mountain Lake Park Oakland Smithsburg Thurmont Westernport Williamsport   Places in southeast Frederick County are occasionally considered as part of Western Maryland as well due to being within the county:  Frederick Mount Airy Urbana Walkersville    See also   List of Appalachian Regional Commission counties   Notes  External links  Western Maryland Scenic Railroad Official Website for the Scenic Railroad and Canal Place.

Edward Lloyd (Governor of Maryland)   Edward Lloyd V (July 22, 1779 June 2, 1834) served as the 13th Governor of Maryland from 1809 to 1811, and as a United States Senator from Maryland between 1819 and 1826.  He also served as a U.S. Congressman from the seventh district of Maryland from 1807 to 1809.Born in 1779 at "Wye House", Talbot County, Maryland, he was a member of a prominent Eastern Shore family, "the Lloyds of Wye," which had lived in Talbot County since the mid-17th century.  He received early education from private tutors.Lloyd served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1800 to 1805.  He was elected to the Ninth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Joseph H. Nicholson and was reelected to the Tenth Congress, serving from December 3, 1806 to March 3, 1809.  In 1808, Lloyd was elected as Governor of Maryland, a position he served in from 1809 to 1811.During this period Lloyd traded a Merino ram for "Sailor," a male Newfoundland (dog) that had a reputation for spectuaclarly enthusiastic water dog retrieving of ducks.  The dog was bred with other retrievers at Lloyd's estate on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay.  Sailor is now considered the "father" of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever line. Lloyd was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the Ninth Regiment of Maryland Militia and also served as a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1811 to 1815.  He was elected as a Democratic Republican (later Crawford Republican, then Jacksonian) to the United States Senate in 1819, was reelected in 1825, and served from March 4, 1819 until his resignation on January 14, 1826.  In the Senate, Lloyd served as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia (Eighteenth and Nineteenth Congresses).Later in life, Lloyd served as member of the Maryland State Senate from 1826 to 1831, and as President of the Senate in 1826.  He died in Annapolis, Maryland, and is interred in the family burying ground at Wye House near Easton, Maryland.Lloyd was an important slaveholder and vocal defender of the institution of slavery throughout his political career. The African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who had grown up as a slave on one of Lloyd's plantations, discussed Lloyd  in his 1845 autobiography The Narrative of Frederick Douglass. The book describes the acts of cruelty committed by Lloyd's overseers, and dwells at length on Lloyd's own despotic treatment of two slaves caring for his horses.

Maryland House of Delegates      The Maryland House of Delegates is the lower house of the General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland, and is composed of 141 Delegates elected from 47 districts.  The House chamber is located in the state capitol building on State Circle in Annapolis.  The state capitol building also houses the Maryland Senate chamber and the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the state of Maryland.  Each Delegate has offices in Annapolis, in the Taylor House Office Building. HistoryThe Maryland House of Delegates originated as the Lower House of the General Assembly in 1650, when the legislature became a bicameral body.  The Lower House often fought with the Upper House for political influence in the colony.  The Upper House consisted of the governor and his council, all personally appointed by Lord Baltimore, and were thus more dedicated to protect his interests in Maryland. Conversely, the Lower House pushed for change in the colony, claiming to be the true elected representatives of the people.  In this context, the Lower House continually fought for more power by asserting exclusive rights in certain legislative areas, such as levying taxes and originating money bills.The governor also had some measure of control over the Lower House in the late seventeenth century.  Despite the fact that each county was entitled to elect four delegates, the governor selected only two of these to sit in the Lower House. This enabled the governor to control the Lower House's membership.In 1689, the transfer of Maryland from a proprietary colony to a royal colony temporarily quieted the disputes between the Lower House and the governor and council.  Appointed by the crown, the royal governors allowed the Lower House substantial latitude with its legislative agenda. The first royal assembly, in 1692, passed 85 acts in a single session. The Lower House immediately acted to remove the governor's influence over the election of delegates. Now, elected delegates could attend the session without the need for a special writ from the governor. At the same time, standing or continuing committees were established. These eliminated the Lower House's reliance on ad hoc committees and created the first modern legislature in Maryland. During this period, the Lower House became known as the House of Delegates.The Maryland Constitution of 1776 formally established the modern House of Delegates. Initially, representation was based on geography as the voters of each county elected four delegates, and two each were elected from Annapolis and Baltimore. These delegates served one-year terms (increased to two years in 1845 and four years in 1922, as it is today).Beginning with the 1838 elections, each county elected at least three and up to six delegates depending on its population. Baltimore City elected the same number of delegates as did the most populous county, but after 1840, Annapolis was considered part of Anne Arundel County. Reapportionment was required after every federal census in an attempt to achieve equal representation.The current pattern for distribution of seats in the House of Delegates began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter. The plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district sends three delegates for a total of 141 members of the House. Some of the larger districts are divided into delegate subdistricts to provide local representation to areas not large enough to constitute an entire legislative district.  Powers and functionsThe powers and functions of the Maryland House of Delegates are outlined in the Maryland Constitution. Along with the State Senate, the House has the power to approve laws, establish executive departments, levy taxes, and propose state constitutional amendments. Both houses also have the power to elect the state treasurer and to appoint a new Governor if the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor are simultaneously vacant. In addition, the House of Delegates has the sole power to impeach members of the executive branch, including the Governor. Once the House of Delegates has passed articles of impeachment, the person impeached stands trial before the State Senate. OrganizationThe House of Delegates utilizes a number of different organizational structures. Much of the work of drafting and reviewing bills is done by six standing committees; Appropriations, Economic Matters, Environmental Matters, Health and Government Operations, Judiciary, and Ways and Means. Each of these committees is then divided further into subcommittees by issue area. An additional committee, Executive Nominations, has the responsibility for confirming appointments of the Governor. Delegates also divide themselves into a variety of legally recognized work groups, Joint and Special Committees, caucuses, and geographic delegations. The two largest caucuses are those of the Democratic and Republican Parties. Smaller caucuses might group Delegates by identity, such as the Women's Caucus or Legislative Black Caucus, or by issue or area of experience, such as the Veteran's Caucus or the Green Caucus.

Interstate 895 (Maryland)  Interstate 895 (I-895) is an Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, the highway runs   between one junction with I-95 in Elkridge and another interchange with I-95 on the east side of Baltimore.  I-895 is a toll road that crosses the Patapsco River estuary via the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, connecting U.S. Route 1 (US 1), I-695, and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway in the southwestern suburbs of Baltimore with US 40 on the east side of Baltimore.  In conjunction with a pair of spurs, unsigned I-895A and I-895B, I-895 provides access to the tunnel from I-97 and Maryland Route 2 (MD 2) in Glen Burnie.  The highway is designed for through traffic by having partial interchanges that require vehicles from almost all starting points to pass through the tunnel and the tunnel toll plaza, where a $3 toll is charged to passenger vehicles, before exiting the facility.  I-895 and its spurs are maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MdTA) and are a part of the National Highway System for their entire length except for the part of I-895B between MD 2 and I-895A. The idea of a crossing of the Patapsco River south of downtown Baltimore has been studied since the 1930s.  In the early 1950s, the Maryland State Roads Commission chose to construct a four-lane tunnel between the Canton and Fairfield neighborhoods of Baltimore and approach highways to connect the tunnel with major highways to Washington, Annapolis, Richmond, and Philadelphia.  The tunnel and approach highways were constructed beginning in 1955 and opened in November 1957, opening a bottleneck for Baltimore through traffic, which formerly had to navigate the city streets.  The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was connected with the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway in the early 1960s and the portion of I-95 south to Washington in the early 1970s.  With these connections, I-895 was burdened with most of the through traffic passing through Baltimore. The congestion was not resolved until I-95 through Baltimore was completed when the eight-lane Fort McHenry Tunnel opened in November 1985.  The transfer of most traffic to the new tunnel allowed the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel to be partially shut down for extensive maintenance in the late 1980s. Route description Western approach I-895 begins at Exit 46 of I-95 in Elkridge with single-lane ramps from I-95 north to I-895 north and I-895 south to I-95 south.  The highway, which has a speed limit of  , expands to four lanes on a viaduct over local roads and CSX's Capital Subdivision and MARC's Camden Line.    I-895 crosses the Patapsco River and US 1 (Washington Boulevard), then receives the ramps from Exit 1 with US 1 south before passing under I-195 with no access.    I-895 continues east with a wide grass median and parallels the Patapsco River and a pair of transmission lines.   The highway passes several industrial facilities in Halethorpe as it crosses the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line and Herbert Run.  I-895 meets I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at Exit 3, then crosses Hammonds Ferry Road in Baltimore Highlands before Exit 4 with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway), where the speed limit drops to  .  The wide median reduces to a Jersey barrier as the highway crosses MD 648 (Annapolis Road).  I-895 crosses marshland, the main line of the Baltimore Light Rail, and the Patapsco River and curves to the northeast at Exit 6 for the southern approach, unsigned I-895B, in Brooklyn Park.    The highway enters the city of Baltimore and curves to the east over Patapsco Avenue before Exit 7 with MD 2 (Potee Street).    I-895 parallels CSX's Curtis Bay Branch as the highway passes between an industrial area to the north and the Brooklyn neighborhood.   The highway crosses the Curtis Bay Branch on a steel truss bridge ahead of Exit 8A with Shell Road, which heads toward the Curtis Bay, Baltimore neighborhood, and Exit 8B with Frankfurst Avenue, which leads to Hanover Street and downtown Baltimore.  I-895 passes through the 14-booth toll plaza for the tunnel, then receives exit ramps for Exit 9 with Childs Street.  The speed limit decreases to   as the highway curves to the northeast through the Fairfield unit of the Port of Baltimore and descends into the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel.   Northern approach I-895 surfaces from the tunnel adjacent to the toll plaza for the Fort McHenry Tunnel within the Canton neighborhood.   The highway passes over several rail lines, then the Exit 10 ramp to Holabird Avenue diverges from I-895 north immediately before passing under I-95 (sharing no access with that Interstate). Now running north, as I-895 returns to ground level, the highway crosses Ponca and Boston streets; the speed limit increases to   ahead of exits 11A-B, Boston and O'Donnell streets, respectively.   The highway crosses a rail line before passing through the Riverside neighborhood in a cut.   I-895 passes under MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) ahead of Exit 12, a full interchange with Lombard Street just to the west of Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.    The highway turns northeast and crosses both the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision before Exit 13 with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) and MD 151 (Erdman Avenue).   After crossing Herring Creek, I-895 meets Moravia Road at Exit 14.   The highway crosses Moores Run before reaching its northern terminus at Exit 62 of I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) just west of the Baltimore city limits, with ramps from I-895 north to I-95 north and I-95 south to I-895 south.   History Planning and constructionIn 1938, the Maryland State Roads Commission (SRC) commissioned an engineering study titled Maryland's Primary Bridge Program to examine the feasibility of major bridges across significant transportation barriers, including a bridge crossing the Patapsco River southeast of the Inner Harbor.   Another study in 1944 examined the idea of a bridge with limited-access approach roads running from US 1 in Elkridge to the Patapsco River crossing and from the bridge to US 40 near Erdman Avenue in east Baltimore.   The financial resources for the project were established in 1947 when the Maryland General Assembly passed an act allowing for the pooling of revenue bonds and toll receipts between the state's toll facilities—the existing Potomac River Bridge and Susquehanna River Bridge, and the upcoming Chesapeake Bay Bridge—to finance the construction of the Patapsco River Crossing.   Finally, a 1953 study examined three different routes—Canton-Fairfield, Canton-Fort McHenry, and a Canton-Fort McHenry-Fairfield dual crossing option—and whether the crossing should be a bridge or tunnel. In 1954, the SRC decided to construct a tunnel between Canton and Fairfield, with three approach highways: a west approach from US 1 in Elkridge, a south approach from MD 2 in Glen Burnie to connect with the west approach in Brooklyn Park, and a north approach from US 40 and Erdman Avenue in east Baltimore.  The approach highways were to be limited-access with directional, partial interchanges so that only traffic intending to use the tunnel would use the approach roads.  Any vehicles entering an approach road would not be able to exit until having passed through the tunnel and the tunnel toll facility. Shortly after work began on the Patapsco Tunnel Project on April 7, 1955, several changes were made to the plans for the approach highways.  The northern terminus at US 40 was altered to allow an extension from US 40 to the southern end of the future Northeastern Expressway (now John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway).  As a result, additional connections with US 40 were planned for the area around present day Exit 14.  In addition, the south approach was to have a tie-in to the Glen Burnie Bypass (now I-97) then under construction.   The tunnel and approach highways were completed and opened November 29, 1957 as the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, respectively.    The opening of the tunnel and approach roads removed a significant amount of traffic from the streets of Baltimore and eliminated 51 traffic lights from the route of motorists passing through the city.   Improvements and reliefThe Harbor Tunnel Thruway was extended north to the city limits of Baltimore to seamlessly connect with the Northeastern Expressway when that highway opened northeast to the Baltimore Beltway in 1961.    In 1969, Moravia Road was extended east to US 40 using the connector between US 40 and the thruway and several ramps were added to that road's interchanges with US 40 and the thruway.    In addition, flyover ramps were constructed at the city limits for I-95 to diverge from the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway onto its own path through east Baltimore in 1970.   The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was extended at its south end in 1973 to connect with I-95 shortly after that Interstate was completed between the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore Beltway in 1971.   Since I-95 had not yet been completed through Baltimore, the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, which was designated I-895 in 1979, was the main route for traffic passing through Baltimore.   As a result, the highway was very congested, and travel through Baltimore had once again become a bottleneck.  Relief came with the completion of the eight-lane Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-95 on November 23, 1985.   With most traffic diverted to the new tunnel, major reconstruction work began on the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel.  Traffic was reduced to one lane in each direction through the tunnel as each of the two tubes was renovated between 1987 and 1989.   More recent changes include the elimination of the entrance ramp from Ponca Street at Exit 10, the expansion of Exit 12 to a full interchange to provide access to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in both directions, and the reconstruction of the northern interchange with I-95 in 2009 so I-895 enters and exits I-95 on the right side of the roadway.  Tolls and exit numbersThe original toll for the Harbor Tunnel Thruway was 40 cents for passenger vehicles and 85 cents for trucks.   By 1985, the toll had risen to $1.   Electronic toll collection began at the toll plaza in 1999 for M-TAG customers; the M-TAG system was absorbed by E-ZPass in 2001.   MdTA increased the toll for passenger vehicles to $2 in 2003.    In May 2011, the agency announced the toll for the Harbor Tunnel Thruway and the two other harbor crossings would increase to $3 on October 1, 2011 and to $4 on July 1, 2013. The Harbor Tunnel Thruway has had three different exit number systems throughout its existence.  The first numbering scheme was in place by 1963.  The northbound exits were numbered between 1 (Holabird Avenue) and 5 (US 40), while the southbound exits were numbered 1 (Hanover Street) to 7 (US 1).   The second numbering scheme, which did not change the interchange numbers on the northern approach to the tunnel, was introduced in 1971.  The exits on the western approach were renumbered 11 (Hanover Street) to 17 (US 1).   Under both schemes, the Childs Street exit did not have a number and the Moravia Road interchange was numbered as Exit 1 of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway.   The third and present numbering scheme was enacted in 1991.  Exit list                                    Auxiliary routesI-895 has two auxiliary routes, I-895A and I-895B.  Both highways are portions of the southern approach to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel that connects with the mainline of the Harbor Tunnel Thruway in Brooklyn Park. I-895AI-895A is the designation for the   connector between the northern end of I-97 just north of I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) and I-895B within Glen Burnie.    The highway was constructed in 1957 to connect the northern end of the Glen Burnie Bypass with the Harbor Tunnel Thruway.    In conjunction with the reconstruction of I-97's interchange with I-695, in which the loop ramp from I-97 north to I-695 west was replaced with a flyover joining I-695 on the left, a loop ramp was added on I-895A in 1995 to allow access to the right side of I-695 west for traffic exiting at MD 648 (Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard).   I-895BI-895B is the designation for the   southern approach to the mainline of Harbor Tunnel Thruway between MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Glen Burnie and I-895 in Brooklyn Park.    The highway was completed in 1957 with the remainder of the Harbor Tunnel Thruway.    The only change to the southern approach is the addition of ramps from I-895B north to I-695 west and from I-695 east to I-895B south to improve access between MD 2 and the Baltimore Beltway; these ramps, now marked as Exit 3A on I-695 east, were completed in 1968.

Goatman (Maryland) The Goatman of Maryland refers to a legendary half-human, half-goat hybrid. LegendAccording to legend, Goatman is an axe-wielding, half-man, half-animal creature that was once a scientist who worked in the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. The tale holds that he was experimenting on goats, the experiment went awry, and he began attacking cars with an axe, roaming the back roads of Beltsville, MD. A variation of the legend tells of Goatman as an old hermit who lives in the woods, seen walking alone at night along Fletchertown Road.    Folklorist at the University of Maryland Barry Lee Pearson said modern examples of folk legends like Goatman are most commonly generated by teenagers, and the stories end up stirring interest in sites like Fletchertown Road.

George Howard (Governor of Maryland) George Howard (November 21, 1789 – August 2, 1846) was the 22nd Governor of the State of Maryland in the United States from 1831 to 1833.  Howard was well known as a fervent anti-Jacksonian during his term in office.  He was the only son of a governor to have been elected governor. BiographyHe was born on November 21, 1789, in the Governor’s Mansion in Annapolis, the second son of Gov. John Eager Howard (1752–1827) and Margaret Oswald "Peggy" Chew.  The family later lived at "Belvedere" in Baltimore County, Maryland where he was educated by tutors.  On December 26, 1811, he married Prudence Gough Ridgely, a daughter of Gov. Charles Carnan Ridgely (1760–1829) of Hampton and Priscilla Dorsey (1762–1814). Archives of Maryland (Biographical Series),  Prudence Gough Ridgely Howard, First Lady of Maryland, 1831-1833, Maryland State Archives  Priscilla descended from the Dorsey family of Maryland; one of the original families of Maryland and founders of Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  They received "Waverly" near Woodstock, Maryland as a wedding gift from his father.    They had fourteen children (nine boys and five girls). At "Waverly," he led the life of a country gentleman and farmer. He was elected a member of the Governor’s Council in January 1831 and worked closely with his predecessor Daniel Martin. When Gov. Martin died in July 1831, Howard, as President of the Council, succeeded him, taking the oath of office on July 22 of that year.  When Martin’s unexpired term ended in January 1832, the Maryland General Assembly elected Howard for a full-year term, receiving 64 of the 82 ballots cast. He advocated the establishment of a State Bank, opposed the doctrine of nullification, was a foe of lotteries, and urged the endowment of Maryland colleges. Howard retired to "Waverly" following the end of his term. He served as a presidential elector in 1836 and 1840, when he supported the Whig candidate. He died at his home on August 2, 1846, and was probably buried first in the family burial ground at "Waverly." His remains were later removed to the Western Cemetery.  His body was again removed, but its present resting place is unknown. He is believed to be buried in the Howard family vault at Old Saint Paul's Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland, where his father John Eager Howard is also buried.  Howard left "Waverly" to his wife, Prudence. She died the following year and willed the estate to the couple's oldest son, George, Jr. George Howard was painted by C. Gregory Stapko. His wife, Prudence Dorsey, was painted by Philip Tilyard. Her portrait can be found in the collection of Hampton National Historic Site HAMP 5662.

Jefferson, Maryland   Jefferson is an unincorporated community located in Frederick County, Maryland, established in 1774, incorporated as a town in 1831. However, a year later, in 1832, the citizens of the town decided that municipal government was unnecessary, thus, it was disincorporated. History of Jefferson According to archaeologist Mary F. Barse, Jefferson was initially laid out in 1774 on a   tract owned by Mrs. Eleanor Medley and called New Town.  It contained 40 rectangular lots – 20 aligned on each side of MD 180 – stretching between what are now Lander Road and Old Middletown Road.  In 1795, twenty-two additional lots were platted by Elias Delashmutt on the western end of the original section, and called New Freedom.  It was not until 1831 that both sections were incorporated as Jefferson by the Maryland Legislature. Jefferson’s growth in the 19th century was due largely to traffic on the road between Frederick and the railroad town of Brunswick.  Wagon traffic and livestock drives were frequent.  Concomitantly, commercial development intensified to serve the surrounding farms as well as travelers. It was during this mid 19th century period of commercial growth during which Hemp's Meats was established in 1849. This butchering shop has continuously served the local community under Hemp family ownership since it opened its doors in 1849.As a center of agricultural mercantilism, throughout most of the late 18th and 19th century Jefferson was also home to a sizable population of slaves. The Hagerstown and Frederick Railway linked Jefferson to Frederick and Hagerstown in 1907.  However, MD 180 remained the only link to the closest steam powered rail station in Brunswick.Examined historic maps (Griffith 1795; Bond 1858; Martenet 1865, 1885; Lake 1873; USGS1910) depict Jefferson on what is now MD 180 as early as 1795.  It is designated Trap Town at the close of the 18th century by Griffith (1795). Local history suggests that the name derives from the large number of taverns operating at the time.  Purportedly, taverns were situated at both ends of town.  Consequently, a traveler could be “trapped” on the way in or out of town.  The Lewis Mill Complex and the George Willard House are National Register of Historic Places properties near Jefferson.Mar-Lu-Ridge Summer Camp and Education and Conference Center, located in Jefferson, has been a main retreat and outdoor ministry site for the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America since 1959.

Hollywood, Maryland Hollywood  is an unincorporated community located within St. Mary's County, Maryland.  It was named in 1867, when a storeowner at Thompson's General Store near the Uniontown section of Hollywood required a name for the post office inside the store. The storeowner was inspired by the gigantic holly tree planted in front of the store and named the post office Hollywood.  HistoryHollywood is home to distinctive landmarks such as the congregation of St. John Francis Regis Catholic Church, which was founded in 1690. The area also includes the nationally renowned Sotterley Plantation on the banks of the Patuxent River. Sotterley was founded in 1703 by James Bowles, a wealthy planter, eventually changing hands to former Maryland Governor George Plater and through the 20th century to Louisa Satterlee and her husband. She was the daughter of J.P. Morgan. The town is also home to a recently demolished manor house, Resurrection Manor, which was thought to have been built in 1640 by Thomas Cornwalleys, the grandfather of the General Lord Cornwallis who surrendered to George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War. EconomyThe contemporary community of Hollywood now serves as a small rural community with extensive farms that produce soybean, corn, hay, grains, wheats, and formerly tobacco. It currently hosts an industrial park where corporations such as Northrop Grumman have branch offices. There is a training/conference center for engineers attached to the nearby Patuxent River Naval Air Station. Numerous roads lead to the shore of the Patuxent River. Hollywood is not an incorporated town, residing under the direct authority of the St. Mary's County Commissioners. SchoolsHollywood is home to Hollywood Elementary School  on Joy Chapel Road, which is divided into multiple "houses" that each emphasize a different culture from around the world. Hollywood is also the home of St. John Regis Catholic School. St. John's School was opened on September 12, 1923 under the leadership of Rev. Joseph M. Johnson, S.J. The first four grades were taught in the sacristy of the church and grades five through eight were held in a second story room over the sacristy. From the 1920s until the 1980s, the school was staffed by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, Kentucky. On May 20, 1924 the white frame section of the school was completed as a four-room school building. On June 15, 1952 a brick addition of two classrooms, auditorium and full basement were completed. Later, part of the auditorium was partitioned to make two additional classrooms and the remaining auditorium space was converted to a library. Socks the catSocks, the cat of President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, lived in Hollywood after the Clintons left the White House in 2001. Socks, who lived with Bill Clinton's secretary Betty Currie, was euthanized in 2009. References

Patuxent County, Maryland 
Comcast Center (College Park, Maryland)     Comcast Center is the arena for the University of Maryland Terrapins men's and women's basketball teams. The Comcast Center, dubbed "The House Gary Built", was ranked the 7th-toughest venue to play in by EA Sports. The on-campus facility is named for the Comcast Corporation, which purchased a 20-year, $25 million corporate naming agreement. Comcast Center replaced Cole Field House as home court, which had served as the home of Maryland basketball since 1955. Ground was broken in May 2000 and construction was completed in October 2002 at a cost of $125 million.   Comcast Center, which has a capacity of 17,950,  opened for Midnight Madness on October 11, 2002 and the first official men's game was a 64-49 victory over Miami University (Ohio) on November 24, 2002.  On January 25, 2012, the court was renamed in honor of Gary Williams, the men's basketball coach who had retired the previous year. FacilitiesIn addition to the main basketball court, Comcast Center also features a 1,500-seat gymnasium for volleyball, gymnastics and wrestling; an academic support center; a 400-seat banquet hall; and the offices of the athletics department. Inside the lobby on the east side of the facility is the Terrapin Walk of Fame and History, featuring many images of the past of Maryland athletics as well as the 2002 men's national championship trophy and the 2006 women's national championship trophy.The student section contains 4,000 seats arranged in the first ten rows on all sides of the arena, plus the most notable feature of the arena, the steeply pitched seating area at the west end of the arena behind the visiting team's second half basket, informally known as "the Wall." Originally designed to reduce excavation costs due to a hill, the area features 2,600 student seats meant to intimidate opposing players who shoot free throws in the second half.Although it is Maryland's largest arena, it is actually the second-largest arena in the Washington, D.C. area, behind the Verizon Center. It is also used for concerts, graduation ceremonies including those for the University of Maryland, and other special events. Concert seating capacity is nearly 19,000. Student sectionMaryland students are primarily positioned along courtside and "The Wall," a kop style seating section behind the opponent's 2nd half basket filled with only students. Normally there are 4,000 students in attendance, so Maryland is considered one of the most intimidating student sections in the ACC alongside North Carolina and Duke. Because of the athletic department's online lottery system which distributes tickets to students, most games are student sell-outs. Student attendance is typically highest for conference games (especially Duke, for which the demand for tickets is exceedingly high), non-conference games against top teams (such as the annual ACC–Big Ten Challenge) and the annual "Maryland Madness" event (formerly, though still colloquially, known as "Midnight Madness") held in October to signify the team's ability to begin practicing. Attendance by students is generally lowest for early season exhibition and non-conference games, as well as games played while the students are on Thanksgiving and winter break.The online ticket system was implemented for both football and men's basketball beginning with the 2002–2003 season, as an alternative to the traditional method which required students to camp out for tickets to big games. Though it is somewhat more fair in that it gives all students an opportunity to attend games without forcing them to give up time waiting in lines, it has come under fire by students for several reasons. Because there are more than twice as many tickets available for football games, these problems are generally not significantly associated with football. Loyalty PointsTickets are given via a weighted lottery; students accumulate loyalty points for claiming and attending games and Maryland Madness. Each point gives the student one more entry in the lottery for subsequent games. For example, a student with 10 loyalty points will have his or her name entered 11 times for the game he or she wishes to attend (once by default, and once more for each point); by contrast, a student with zero loyalty points will have his or her name entered only once. Though the system does give a decided advantage to students with more points, as it was designed to do, it is still possible (and somewhat common) for students with no or few points to receive tickets to late season games. This aspect is most commonly debated leading up to the yearly home game against Duke, when an abnormally high amount of students request tickets, and it is not uncommon for students who have attended every home game to lose the lottery while students who have attended no games win a ticket.  "Scan and Leave"As a result of the advantages students gain by attending games early in the season against typically underwhelming non-conference opponents, a phenomenon developed known among students as "scanning and leaving." In order to receive a loyalty point, a student must do three things: request a ticket online, claim it (if selected in the lottery) and, finally, present their ticket and student ID at the entrance to Comcast Center to be scanned and authenticated. Once the student's ticket is scanned and he or she is allowed into the game, the ticketing system awards the student a loyalty point. The student is then free to leave the game whenever he or she pleases. As a result, many "diehard" fans complain that a significant number of students "scan and leave" games, even well-attended conference games, as a means of building up loyalty points for games later in the season with a greater degree of perceived significance and/or a higher chance of demand exceeding supply.  Notable games at Comcast Center  December 14, 2002 – In Maryland's debut game against a ranked opponent at the new arena, they fell to the #17 University of Florida Gators, 69–64. Despite a valiant effort, Maryland's inability to contain Anthony Roberson from behind the arc and shooting just 36% from the free throw line led to a less than auspicious christening of the facility against a ranked opponent.    January 18, 2003 – The Terrapins defeated then undefeated #1 Duke, 87–72.    February 17, 2003 – Due to a major snowstorm in the area, the game against #10 Wake Forest was postponed from the previous night. Since most ticket holders were unable to travel to College Park, the athletic department instituted an open attendance policy. Anyone with a valid student ID was given free admission and the general public was charged $20. The near-capacity crowd was composed mostly of students enjoying their snowday, and the Terrapins defeated the Demon Deacons, 90–67.    February 22, 2004 – The third largest crowd to watch an Atlantic Coast Conference women's regular season basketball game and the second largest crowd to watch a women’s game at the Comcast Center (13,346), went home disappointed as No. 4-ranked Duke defeated the Terrapins 72–59.    February 12, 2005 – The Terrapins won their third consecutive game against Duke and became first team to sweep the regular season series from the Blue Devils since Wake Forest did it during 1995–96 season. The 99–92 overtime thriller coincided with a visit from ESPN's College GameDay.    February 13, 2005 – The No. 18-ranked women's team lost to No. 4-ranked Duke 60–49 in front of the largest crowd to watch an Atlantic Coast Conference women's regular season basketball game (17,243).    March 20–22, 2005 – Comcast Center hosted first- and second-round games for the NCAA women's basketball tournament. The No. 7-seeded Terps used their home court advantage to defeat 10-seed Wisconsin–Green Bay but lost to No. 2-seeded Ohio State. In the other games, Liberty became only the second 13-seed to advance to the Sweet 16 by upsetting fourth-seeded Penn State and fifth-seeded DePaul.    February 7, 2006 – Maryland came from behind to beat Virginia, 76–65, to give Gary Williams 349 wins at Maryland, surpassing the record previously set by Charles "Lefty" Driesell.    January 28, 2007 – The largest crowd in ACC women's history, 17,950, watched 2nd ranked North Carolina defeat 3rd-ranked Maryland 84–71, surpassing the record set the previous season.    February 17, 2007 – Undefeated and No. 1 Duke women's team beat #6 Maryland on Senior Day 69–57 on only the second ever sold out game for women's basketball at the Comcast center.    January 14, 2008 – The #4 Maryland women's team beat #10 Duke 85–70 at home for the first time in ten years. The crowd of 15,531 is the fifth largest in ACC women's basketball history.    February 21, 2009 – Trailing by as many as 16 points, and still down by 9 with less than two minutes to go,  unranked Maryland came back to beat #3 North Carolina 88–85 in overtime. Maryland fans rushed the court after the upset victory.    January 25, 2012 – The basketball court was named in honor of Gary Williams, the men's basketball coach who retired after the previous season. That night, the men's basketball team fell to Duke, 74–61.    February 16, 2013 – Maryland Men's Basketball upsets #2 Duke in a thrilling 83-81 victory.  This was the first victory for the Terps against the Blue Devils since 2010 and the first win against a top 3 ranked team since 2009.  This also was the first victory against Duke for Mark Turgeon as the head coach for Maryland Basketball.

The court, which is composed of one chief judge and six associate judges, meets in the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building in the state capital, Annapolis. The term of the Court begins the second Monday of September. FunctionsAs Maryland's highest court, the Court of Appeals reviews cases of both major and minor importance. Throughout the year, the Court of Appeals holds hearings on the adoption or amendment of rules of practice and procedure. It also supervises the Attorney Grievance Commission and State Board of Law Examiners in attorney disciplinary and admission matters. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, designated by the Governor, is the constitutional administrative head of the Maryland judicial system.   Cases typically come before the Court of Appeals on a writ of certiorari from the Court of Special Appeals.  The court can decline the writ, and refuse to hear the case, or it can grant the "cert," and hear the appeal.  The judges sometimes decide to hear an appeal before the lower appellate court has heard the case. While it is generally an Appellate court and hears most cases on appeal, the Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over certain matters, such as legislative redistricting, removal of certain officers, and certification of questions of law.  Additionally, it has exclusive jurisdiction in death penalty appeals. The court does not sit in panels; all seven judges sit on each case unless there is a disqualification, in which event a judge from another court, or a retired appellate judge, may be specially assigned to sit in the place of the disqualified judge.  In practice, almost all cases are heard by seven judges, though a quorum for the court is five judges.  Jurists  Appointment and qualificationsThe seven judges of the Court of Appeals are appointed by the Governor of Maryland with Senate consent. They serve ten-year terms.The Judges of the court are required to be citizens of and qualified voters in Maryland.  Prior to their appointment, they must have resided in Maryland for at least five years, and for at least six months in the appellate judicial circuit from which they are appointed. They must be at least thirty years of age at the time of appointment, and must have been admitted to practice law in Maryland. Appointees should be "most distinguished for integrity, wisdom and sound legal knowledge."After initial appointment by the Governor and confirmation by the Senate, members of the court, at the first general election occurring at least one year after their appointment, run for continuance in office on their records without opposition. If the voters reject the retention in office of a judge, or the vote is tied, the office becomes vacant. Otherwise, the incumbent judge is retained in office for a ten-year term. This requirement of voter approval is similar to provisions in the Missouri Plan, a non-partisan method for selecting judges which is used by 11 states. Like all Maryland judges, members of the Court of Appeals must retire by their 70th birthday. There is one judge from each of the state's seven Appellate Judicial Circuits. Each judge is required to be a resident of his or her respective circuit.  The circuits are currently as follows:    Maryland Court of Appeals Judicial Circuits  Circuit Counties  1 Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico and Worcester Counties  2 Baltimore County and Harford County  3 Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard and Washington Counties  4 Prince George's County  5 Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary's Counties  6 Baltimore City  7 Montgomery County   Current judges Unlike most other states, the jurists on the Maryland Court of Appeals are called judges, not justices.  Also unlike most other American federal, state, and local courts, the judges on the Court of Appeals wear red robes and with white cross-collars, reminiscent of British court dress. Judges at all other levels of the Maryland judiciary wear the more customary black robes.In order of decreasing seniority, the current judges on the court are:    Maryland Court of Appeals Judges by Seniority  Circuit Name  6 Chief Judge Robert M. Bell  4 Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr.  3 Judge Lynne A. Battaglia  5 Judge Clayton Greene, Jr.  1 Judge Sally D. Adkins  7 Judge Mary Ellen Barbera  2 Judge Robert N. “Bob” McDonald   HistoryAs the highest tribunal in Maryland, the Court of Appeals was created by Article 56 of the Maryland Constitution of 1776. The Court was to be "composed of persons of integrity and sound judgment in the law, whose judgment shall be final and conclusive in all cases of appeal, from the general court, court of chancery, and court of admiralty . . ." With counsel, advice and consent, the Governor appointed all of the judges. Five judges were commissioned in 1778, but that number was reduced to three in 1801. The Court was restructured in 1806 by dividing the State into six judicial districts with a chief judge and two associate judges for each district appointed by the Governor and Council. Together, these six chief judges constituted the Court of Appeals which began to sit on the Eastern Shore at Easton as well as on the Western Shore at the State capital.The Maryland Constitution of 1851 divided the State into four judicial districts. Voters of each district elected a judge to the Court of Appeals for a ten-year term. The Court became responsible solely for appellate duties and sat only at Annapolis, whereas before it sat in various locations throughout the State. Five judges, each elected from one of five judicial districts, were prescribed by the Maryland Constitution of 1864.The Maryland Constitution of 1867 (currently in effect) returned to the older form of requiring Court of Appeals judges to assume trial court and appellate duties. In seven judicial circuits, the Governor, with Senate advice and consent, designated a chief judge. In the eighth judicial circuit (Baltimore City), the voters elected the chief judge. These eight chief judges then constituted the Court of Appeals.Judicial reorganization in 1943 provided for a five-member Court of Appeals elected for terms of fifteen years. The five judges included two from Baltimore City and one each from three appellate judicial circuits. In 1960, the number of judges was increased to the present-day seven. Until 1994, there was one from each of the first five Appellate Judicial Circuits and two from the Sixth Appellate Judicial Circuit (Baltimore City), but a Constitutional amendment realigned the circuits to create seven circuits with one judge from each.  Since 1975, the Court of Appeals has heard cases almost exclusively by way of certiorari. As a result, the Court's formerly excessive workload has been reduced to a more manageable level, thus allowing the Court to devote more time to the most important and far-reaching issues.

Government of Maryland   The government of Maryland is conducted according to the Maryland Constitution. The United States is a federation; consequently, the government of Maryland, like the other 49 state governments, has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States. Administrative influence in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. Unlike most other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland’s counties.Most of the business of government is done in Annapolis, the state capital. Virtually all state and county elections are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four, in which the President of the United States is not elected—this, as in other states, is intended to divide state and federal politics. Executive branchThe constitution establishes five principal executive branch officers, as described below. Four of them are elected statewide: the governor and lieutenant governor (who are elected on the same ticket), the attorney general, and the comptroller. The fifth, the treasurer, is elected by a joint ballot of both houses of the General Assembly. Governor   As in all states, a popularly elected governor heads Maryland's executive branch. The governor's cabinet is known as the Executive Council. Like most state chief executives, the Maryland governor is elected to serve a four-year term. He or she is term limited to serve no more than two consecutive terms. The Governor is elected under the plurality system. The current governor is Martin O'Malley.The governor has power to veto laws passed by the state's legislature and, like most of the nation's governors, also has a line item veto, which can be used to strike certain portions of appropriations bills. The state legislature can override a veto by a three-fifths (60%) vote of the total number of members in each house. This is different from most states, which usually require a higher two-thirds (66.66%) vote to override a veto.The appointment powers of the governor are extensive, as he or she appoints almost all military and civil officers of the State subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. In addition to appointing the heads of major departments, boards, and commissions of the State government, the Governor appoints certain boards and commissions in each county and the City of Baltimore, as provided for by law. The Governor also commissions notaries public and appoints persons to fill vacancies in the offices of Attorney General and Comptroller (both of which are normally elected by the people) and also to fill vacant seats in the General Assembly. Any officer appointed by the Governor (except interim members of the General Assembly) is removable by him for cause. The governor is commander-in-chief of the military forces of the State, the Maryland National Guard, except when such forces are called into the national service by the President of the United States, as well as the Maryland Defense Force. In times of public emergency the Governor has certain emergency powers as defined by law. Lieutenant Governor   The Maryland Lieutenant Governor is elected on the same ticket as the state's Governor and is nominally the second highest-ranking official in the state. The position was first created by the short-lived Maryland Constitution of 1864 and functioned from 1865 to 1868 before being abolished by the state's present constitution, which was ratified in 1867. The position was re-established by Constitutional amendment in 1970, under which the Lieutenant Governor "shall have only the duties delegated to him by the Governor."The Maryland Lieutenant Governor, currently Anthony G. Brown, is therefore weaker than the office in most other states which have one (several states do not have one). For instance, in many states, including Texas, the Lieutenant Governor is the President of the State's Senate and in California the Lieutenant Governor assumes all of the Governor's powers when he or she is out of the state. In both of those states, as in some others, the Lieutenant Governor is elected in his or her own right, independently of the state's Governor.In practice, Maryland's Lieutenant Governor attends cabinet meetings, chairs various task forces and commissions, represents the state at ceremonial functions and at events which the Governor cannot attend, and advises the Governor. If there is a vacancy in the office of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor becomes the Governor. A vacancy in the Lieutenant Governorship is filled by a person nominated by the Governor and confirmed by a majority vote of the General Assembly voting in joint session. Attorney General   The Attorney General is the chief legal officer of the State and is elected by the people every four years with no term limits. To run for the office a person must be a citizen of and qualified voter in Maryland and must have resided and practiced law in the state for at least ten years. The current attorney general is Doug Gansler.The Attorney General has general charge, supervision and direction of the legal business of the State. He or she is the legal advisor and representative of the Governor, the General Assembly, the Judiciary, and the major departments, various boards, commissions, officials and institutions of State Government. The Office further represents the State in all cases pending in the Appellate Courts of the State, and in the United States Supreme Court and lower Federal Courts. This has led to significant conflict when the Attorney General and Governor have strongly differing views. Comptroller   The Comptroller is the state's chief financial officer and is also elected by the people for a four-year term. The comptroller is not term-limited. The office was established by the Maryland Constitution of 1851 due to concern about the potential for fraud and corruption in the administration of the public treasury. The constitutional duties of the office begin with the broad mandate to exercise "general superintendence of the fiscal affairs of the State", which includes collecting taxes and maintaining the general ledger. The Comptroller (or a deputy) countersigns all checks drawn by the State Treasurer upon the deposits of the State. The Comptroller also prescribes the formalities for transfer of other evidence of State debt and countersigns such papers. The current comptroller is Peter Franchot.In addition, the comptroller's office audits taxpayers for compliance, handles delinquent tax collection, and enforces license and unclaimed property laws. The agency publicizes forgotten bank accounts, insurance benefits and other unclaimed assets of taxpayers. Acting as Maryland's chief accountant, the comptroller pays the state's bills, maintains its books, prepares financial reports, and pays state employees. Treasurer  The Treasurer, currently Nancy K. Kopp, is the principal custodian of the State's cash deposits, money from bond sales, and other securities and collateral and directs the investments of those assets. The Treasurer is elected by a joint ballot of both houses of the General Assembly, a tradition begun starting with the Maryland Constitution of 1851, which also created the Board of Public Works (see below). Because of the close relationship with the General Assembly, the Treasurer briefs the members of the Legislature on matters concerning the State Treasury. The Treasurer is also responsible for producing an annual report to provide the Governor, the General Assembly, and the public with current information about the operations of the State Treasurer's Office. Board of Public Works  The State Board of Public Works was first created by the Maryland Constitution of 1864 and is composed of the Governor, who chairs it, the Comptroller, and the Treasurer. The three-member board is quite powerful and there is no other state that has a similar institution. The board, which generally meets twice a month, reviews and approves capital projects, procurement contracts, and the acquisition, use, and transfer of State assets, to assure that executive decisions are made responsibly and responsively. Legislative branch  The state's legislative branch is styled the General Assembly and consists of a 47-member Senate and a 141-member House of Delegates. It meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2300 bills including the State's annual budget. The 426th Session began January 14, 2009 and adjourned April 13, 2009.  Like the governor, members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.The current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial U.S. Census. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. Some of the larger districts are divided into delegate subdistricts to provide local representation to areas not large enough to constitute an entire legislative district.The Senate is led by a President and the House by a Speaker whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. Judicial branch  Court of Appeals  The Maryland Court of Appeals is the highest court in the state. In addition to being the court of last resort for the state, the Court of Appeals also administers and sets rules and guidelines for the state's court system. It has original jurisdiction in only a few areas and hears most cases on appeal. The court has seven judges, one from each of the state's seven appellate judicial circuits, which are presently as follows:  1st Appellate Judicial Circuit: Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico & Worcester counties 2nd Appellate Judicial Circuit: Baltimore County & Harford County 3rd Appellate Judicial Circuit: Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard & Washington counties 4th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Prince George's County 5th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles & St. Mary's counties 6th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Baltimore City 7th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Montgomery County   Court of Special Appeals  To ease the caseload of the Court of Appeals, the state's second-highest court, the Court of Special Appeals, was created in 1966, following a constitutional amendment. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Court of Special Appeals has exclusive initial appellate jurisdiction over any reviewable judgment, decree, order, or other action of a circuit court or an orphans' court, except for appeals in criminal cases in which the death penalty is imposed. Generally, it hears cases appealed from the circuit courts. Judges of the Court of Special Appeals are empowered to sit in panels of three. A hearing or rehearing of a case en banc, in which all of the Court's judges sit, may be ordered in any case by a majority of the Court's incumbent judges. The court has thirteen judges, one from each of the state's seven judicial appellate circuits and six at-large judges.Judges on both appellate courts are appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the Senate and the approval of the people, for 10 years. This system is similar to the Missouri Plan, which is used in 11 states to fill judicial appointments, in that voters get to decide whether or not to continue a judge in office. However, it is different in that the Governor's choice in who to appoint is not limited by a Judicial Selection Commission and the State Senate must confirm the nominee before he or she takes office. Circuit Courts   Circuit Courts are the highest common law and equity courts of record exercising original jurisdiction within Maryland. Each has full common law and equity powers and jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases within its county or counties, and all the additional powers and jurisdiction conferred by the Maryland Constitution and by law, except where jurisdiction has been limited or conferred exclusively upon another tribunal by law. The Circuit Courts are trial courts of general jurisdiction. Their jurisdiction is very broad but generally covers major civil cases and more serious criminal matters. Circuit Courts also may decide appeals from the District Court and certain administrative agencies. Cases can be heard by a jury when the amount in controversy is over $15,000. Juries are limited to the Circuit Courts.The state is divided into eight judicial circuits, which are presently as follows:  1st Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Dorchester (1 judge), Somerset (1 judge), Wicomico (3 judges) & Worcester (2 judges) counties 2nd Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Caroline (1 judge), Cecil (3 judges), Kent (1 judge), Queen Anne's(1 judge) & Talbot (1 judge) counties 3rd Judicial Circuit (21 judges): Baltimore County (16 judges) & Harford County (5 judges) 4th Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Allegany (2 judges), Garrett (1 judge) & Washington (4 judges) counties 5th Judicial Circuit (18 judges): Anne Arundel (10 judges), Carroll (3 judges) & Howard (5 judges) counties 6th Judicial Circuit (24 judges): Frederick (4 judges) & Montgomery (20 judges) counties 7th Judicial Circuit (32 judges): Calvert (2 judges), Charles (4 judges), Prince George's (23 judges) & St Mary's (3 judges) counties 8th Judicial Circuit (30 judges): Baltimore City  Unlike other state courts, the Circuit Court has no chief judge. Instead, eight circuit administrative judges perform administrative duties in each of their respective circuits. Each Circuit Court judge is appointed by the Governor (with Senate confirmation) and then must stand for election. The judge's name is placed on the ballot in the first general election that occurs at least one year following the vacancy the judge was appointed to fill. The judge may be opposed formally by one or more qualified members of the bar, with the successful candidate being elected to a fifteen-year term. District CourtThe Maryland District Court has jurisdiction in minor civil and criminal matters, and in virtually all violations of the Motor Vehicle Law. Created by a constitutional amendment in 1970, the court began operating in July 1971. It replaced the justices of the peace, the county trial magistrates, the People's Courts (in certain counties), and various minor courts. With statewide jurisdiction, the Court functions in every county and Baltimore City.The exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court generally includes all landlord and tenant cases; replevin actions; motor vehicle violations; and criminal cases if the penalty is less than three years imprisonment or does not exceed a fine of $2,500, or both. The District Court has concurrent jurisdiction in misdemeanors and certain enumerated felonies, but has little equity jurisdiction. Small claims (civil cases involving amounts not exceeding $5,000) also come under the jurisdiction of the District Court. In civil cases involving amounts over $5,000 (but not exceeding $25,000), the District Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts. Since the District Court provides no juries, a person entitled to and electing a jury trial must proceed to the Circuit Court. However, appeals from the District Court can be heard de novo in the Circuit Court.District Court judges are appointed by the Governor to ten-year terms, subject to Senate confirmation. Unlike other judges in the state, they do not stand for election. As of October 2003, some 105 judges, including the Chief Judge, who is designated by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, serve on the Court. As the District Court's administrative head, its Chief Judge appoints administrative judges for each of the twelve districts, subject to the approval of the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals. Administered centrally, the District Court of Maryland is funded totally by the State.The District Court of Maryland is divided into twelve geographical districts as follows:  District 1 (26 judges): Baltimore City District 2 (5 judges): Dorchester (1 judge), Somerset (1 judge), Wicomico (2 judges) & Worcester (1 judge) counties District 3 (6 judges): Caroline (1 judge), Cecil (2 judges), Kent (1 judge), Queen Anne's (1 judge) & Talbot (1 judge) counties District 4 (4 judges): Calvert (1 judge), Charles (2 judges) & St. Mary's (1 judge) counties District 5 (13 judges): Prince George's County District 6 (11 judges): Montgomery County District 7 (8 judges): Anne Arundel County District 8 (13 judges): Baltimore County District 9 (4 judges): Harford County District 10 (7 judges): Carroll (2 judges) & Howard (5 judges) counties District 11 (5 judges): Frederick (3 judges) & Washington (2 judges) counties District 12 (3 judges): Allegany (2 judges) & Garrett (1 judge) counties   Local government At the local level, Maryland is notable among U.S. states for having a relatively small number of local governments.  Maryland is also unique among Northeastern states in that it has fairly strong county governments. In most Northeastern states, counties are administrative divisions with little (and in the case of New England, almost nonexistent) authority, and most local government is at the town or city level. This is not true for Maryland's 23 counties, some of which have substantial authority. There are three forms of county government available to the state's counties.  Note that the municipal government of Baltimore City, while not formally a county government, is typically considered to be on par with them and is reckoned as a county-equivalent for census purposes. Including Baltimore, there are 157 incorporated cities in Maryland. Commissioner countiesIn 1827, the General Assembly authorized elected boards of county commissioners for each county.  Commissioner counties do not have home rule power.  That is, they have no authority to act in local matters without the express prior consent of the General Assembly.  In the areas where they do have authority to legislate, that authority is narrowly construed. As a result of this, the General Assembly spends considerable time dealing with local issues, ordinances, and expenditures. The Constitution adopted in 1867 kept the power to pass public local laws vested in the General Assembly, which gave a lot of control over county government to county delegations in the General Assembly.Currently, eight counties are run by commissioners. They are: Calvert, Carroll, Cecil, Frederick, Garrett, St. Mary's, Somerset, and Washington Counties. Charter countiesDue partly to the large amount of time spent by the state legislature on local matters, the Maryland Constitution was amended in 1915 to allow counties the option of operating under a charter form of government. To adopt this form of government, the voters of the county must approve the charter which their charter board drafts. Once ratified, this gives the county control over almost all local matters, though power to regulate elections and to license and regulate the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is reserved to the General Assembly. Some counties which operate under charters have a separately-elected county executive while others vest executive functions along with legislative functions in the county council.Currently, nine counties, including the most populous ones, operate under the charter form of government. They are: Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Dorchester, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's, Talbot, and Wicomico Counties.  Baltimore City also operates under a charter. Code Home Rule counties  Due to the reluctance of many counties to adopt a charter form of government, despite wanting a measure of home rule, the Maryland Constitution was again amended in 1966 to create the code county status. If two thirds of a county's commissioners adopt a resolution that the county become a code county and a majority of the voters approve of the resolution, the county becomes a code county. In a code county the commissioners have home-rule powers and may enact legislation in the areas of the "express powers" of the charter counties. In addition, the commissioners retain all the powers of commissioners in commissioner counties.  However, there is no charter, and the limits on indebtedness are stricter.  The General Assembly can only legislate for the code counties as a class.Currently, six counties operate as code counties: Allegany, Caroline, Charles, Kent, Queen Anne's, and Worcester Counties. Maryland and the national government   Maryland was the seventh state to ratify the United States Constitution, on April 28, 1788. Maryland elects two United States Senators and eight members of the United States House of Representatives. The state is served by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (with two divisions, sitting in Baltimore and Greenbelt) and federal appeals from the state go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia.

University of Maryland School of Law     The University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law (University of Maryland School of Law) is the second-oldest law school in the United States by date of establishment and third-oldest by date of first classes.  The school is located on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore in Downtown Baltimore's West Side. The school was founded in 1816 as the Maryland Law Institute and began regular instruction in 1824. Because of its location in downtown Baltimore, Maryland, Maryland Law is part of the District of Columbia–Baltimore legal and business communities. In 2003, the law school moved into a new, state-of-the-art facility at 500 West Baltimore Street on the west side of downtown Baltimore near the Inner Harbor and Oriole Park at Camden Yards.   In 2009, the School of Law appointed its ninth dean of the school, Phoebe A. Haddon, Maryland Law | Phoebe A. Haddon   who previously was a faculty member at Temple University Beasley School of Law, and is a national leader in legal education and an expert on jury participation, the courts and diversity.  In 2011, the law school received a $30 million donation from the W.P. Carey Foundation, which is the largest gift in the school's history. In response, the law school changed its name to the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. Maryland Law has been ranked in the top tier of American law schools by U.S. News & World Report, maintaining its position in the rankings over the years, currently ranked 39th in the most recent 2013 edition. University of Maryland | Best Law School | US News   The 2013 Rankings also gave Maryland top standing in the categories of Clinical Training (#5), Health Care Law (#3), Part-Time Program (#9), Environmental Law (#11) and Trial Advocacy (#8).  Additionally, Maryland ranks 22nd in the nation among public law schools.  The National Jurist recently named Maryland as a top-10 public interest law school in the nation. Maryland Law is fully accredited by the American Bar Association, is a member of the Association of American Law Schools, and has a chapter of the Order of the Coif. Students, faculty, and alumni Approximately 830 students are enrolled at Maryland Law. The University of Maryland School of Law    They are diverse in age, gender, academic background, prior employment, and race, with more than 30% identifying themselves as persons of color.  There are more than 40 student organizations,  four specialized legal centers,  and five law journals.  Many resources are available to new students, including upper-class peer advisers, skill-enhancement sessions, a legal writing center,  and one-on-one academic counseling. Maryland Law faculty are national leaders in a wide range of subject areas, and they are available to support and advise students.  Smaller classes and a 12:1 student/faculty ratio enable close working relationships to develop in a professional and intellectually vibrant setting. Students directly benefit from a broad network of Maryland Law alumni, who occupy positions of professional leadership throughout the state, region, and nation. Alumni act as mentors, volunteer judges, and adjunct faculty to help connect each student’s law school experience with the professional life of the surrounding legal community. Academics CurriculumThe rigorous core curriculum at Maryland Law includes Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, Torts, Property, Contracts, and Criminal Law, as well as a two-semester course focusing on legal skills of analysis, research, writing, and oral argument.  These required courses form the basis for more specialized study through more than 150 elective courses, seminars, independent studies, simulations, clinics, and externships. Each student must also satisfy an advanced writing requirement by producing a substantial paper based on extensive research. Full-time day students generally complete the Juris Doctor curriculum in three years, and part-time evening students typically take four years. Specialty programsMaryland Law is home to several nationally recognized specialty programs.  These programs enable students to explore areas of particular interest through experiential learning and a specialized curriculum. Through clinics and externships, student organizations, conferences and symposia, and an extensive alumni network, students can immerse themselves in a wealth of specialized offerings to prepare for the demands of a particular area of law. Three specialty programs – in Law and Health Care,  Environmental Law,  and Clinical Law Maryland Law | Clinical Law   — have established national reputations for excellence. Each of these programs draws on the academic resources of Maryland Law's sister professional schools to provide a rich and interdisciplinary learning experience. Students may earn a legal certificate through the Environmental Law Program or the Law and Health Care Program. Other specialty areas are no less rigorous and include the following:  Advocacy Business Law  Intellectual Property Law  International and Comparative Law  Legislation and Public Policy  Women, Leadership & Equality   Students can focus their studies in other areas as well, including criminal law, dispute resolution, family law/child advocacy, general practice, jurisprudence/legal history, labor/employment/administrative law, property/real estate/decedent’s estates law, public interest law/community development, and tax law. Dual-degree programsThe law school offers several dual-degree options:  Business  J.D./Master of Business Administration through the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland College Park J.D./Master of Business Administration through the Merrick School of Business at the University of Baltimore   Public Policy  J.D./Master of Public Policy from the University of Maryland School of Public Policy   J.D./Master of Public Management J.D./PhD in Public Policy through the University of Maryland Baltimore County School of Public Policy J.D./Master of Community Planning through the University of Maryland Urban Studies and Planning Program   Health  J.D./Master of Public Health from the University of Maryland School of Medicine J.D./Master of Science in Toxicology Risk Assessment and Environmental Law from the University of Maryland School of Medicine J.D./Master of Science in Nursing from the University of Maryland School of Nursing (J.D./M.S.)

Building on the law school's nationally recognized specialty programs, the LL.M. provides advanced legal education for lawyers and law students seeking to develop expertise in a specific area of study. It is an academically rigorous program designed for individuals from the U.S. and abroad who are eager to engage in scholarly explorations of pressing legal issues.  Clinical Law ProgramThrough the Cardin Requirement, named after Maryland Law alumnus U.S. Senator Benjamin Cardin, each full-time day student gains hands-on legal experience by representing actual clients who would otherwise lack access to justice. Most students fulfill the Cardin Requirement through the nationally recognized Clinical Law Program,  which provides more than 110,000 hours of free legal services to Maryland’s poorest citizens each year. The legal clinic is among the best and largest teaching law firms in the nation. Students work alongside senior faculty members on real-life cases, gaining a unique combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience to prepare them for the demands of a career in law. More than 25 clinics  focus on a broad range of practice areas, including civil and criminal litigation, advice and counseling, and transactional work. Civil practice areas include environmental law, health, housing and community development, juvenile law and children, AIDS, and immigration. Criminal student attorneys often represent defendants in misdemeanor cases in Maryland’s district courts, as well as work in the School of Law's community justice efforts. In addition to in-house clinical work, students may gain experience in public and private nonprofit externships in the Baltimore-Washington region. InitiativesIn addition to formal Programs and Centers, the Law School sponsors a variety of academic and public service initiatives. These initiatives enhance the educational and scholarly mission of the Law School and also serve the community.  Leadership, Ethics and Democracy (LEAD) Initiative In spring 2008, the Fetzer Institute made a three-year $1.6 million funding commitment to the School of Law to help it respond to these challenges and create a Leadership, Ethics and Democracy program (LEAD). Through this initiative, the School of Law seeks to help its students realize their leadership potential, develop good ethical and moral judgment and develop the cross-cultural competence they will need to practice law in today's global arena. Along the way, the students will discover how the law can be used to reinforce democracy and achieve justice.  Legislation, politics, and public policy The University of Maryland School of Law offers students a broad educational experience in the areas of legislation, public policy and public interest practice. Through a combination of traditional coursework, advanced legal research, in-house faculty supervised clinics, and externships, students will develop the knowledge and skills appropriate for employment with legislative bodies, governmental agencies, non-profit organizations or lobbying practices at all levels of government.  Linking Law & the Arts Collaborating with Baltimore's leading professional theater company to produce an original, dramatic presentation of the Brown v. Board of Education case in celebration of the historic decision's 50th anniversary. Bringing together a top Hollywood casting director, an actor from NBC's Homicide: Life on the Street, a playwright and a theater director for a fascinating panel discussion about non-traditional casting, illustrated by actors of different races, genders, and disabilities performing scenes in roles where they may not traditionally be considered. Hosting a national gathering of film scholars, critics, and law professors for a two-day conference, "The Impact of Film on Law, Lawyers and the Legal System," addressing the growing influence of contemporary film—features and documentaries—on culture and assessing the significance of inexpensive emerging media technologies for filmmakers and the general population. Any of these programs would be at home in a fine arts graduate program. But all have been staged by the University of Maryland School of Law, in conjunction with local arts organizations, as part of the innovative "Linking Law and Arts" series. The programs accomplish complementary goals, using theater and art to help address complex legal, social and public policy issues, while using the lens of law and society to help the public better understand theater and art. As part of their unique commitment to blending law and the arts, students and professors at the University of Maryland School of Law produced a short film in 2010 about the handling of war tribunals at Guantanamo Bay entitled "The Respose" starring Aasif Mandvi. UMD Carey Law is also one of less than ten law schools in the United States to offer a course in Visual Legal Advocacy, teaching students how to and encouraging them to incorporate cinema into their advocacy work.  Law School complex and libraryThe School of Law and the Thurgood Marshall Law Library occupy a state-of-the-art complex that supports the school’s programs integrating classroom and experiential learning. The facility opened in 2002 and contains three courtrooms, including the Ceremonial Moot Courtroom, where state and federal trial and appellate courts regularly sit in session to hear cases. Classrooms and courtrooms are equipped with the latest in educational technology, as well as wired and wireless Internet access for student use. In addition to their own notebook computers, students can use public computers located throughout the facility for writing and research. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library houses a collection of more than 495,000 volumes and equivalents accessible through the online catalog.  A staff of 23, including 11 librarians, provides customized reference and consulting services to faculty and students. In addition to LexisNexis and Westlaw, the library offers an extensive array of legal and non-legal Web-based electronic databases.Contrary to the commonly accepted history, Thurgood Marshall was not denied entry to the University of Maryland. In fact he never applied, as it was then common practice to deny all African Americans admission to the University of Maryland. Marshall went on to attend law school at Howard University.

Nanjemoy, Maryland    Nanjemoy is a settlement along Maryland Route 6 in southwestern Charles County, Maryland, United States, and the surrounding large rural area more or less bounded by Nanjemoy Creek to the east and north, and the Potomac River to the south and west. It and the creek draw their names from a Native American tribe.  Nanjemoy is within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, being about 25 miles (40 km) south of the Capital Beltway (Interstates 95 and 495). The village center includes a Post Office and a county-operated community center building that  serves the area's population.  Two children's camps and a sheriffs' training facility are also in the Nanjemoy area.The area is served by Maryland Route 6 and other two-lane state highways;  the nearest major roads are Maryland Route 210 to the north and U.S. Route 301 to the east.  The Nanjemoy area is becoming increasingly popular with Washington-area commuters, particularly those working in nearby Indian Head or Fort Washington in Maryland or in Alexandria, Virginia.  The Waldorf, Maryland, commercial area is nearby to the east, along U.S. 301.  No rail lines presently serve the area.Much of the Nanjemoy area is now forest or farmland. Tobacco was formerly commonly cultivated in the area, but is now rarely grown there.  Other settlements in the Nanjemoy area include Grayson, Maryland Point, and Riverside.  Chickamuxen, Doncaster, and Ironsides are nearby to the north. History The Southern-sympathizing area saw occupation by a large force of the Union army during the early part of the American Civil War, with an encampment of about 12,000 soldiers near Chicamuxen,  a few miles (kilometers) north of the Nanjemoy area.The sunken hulls of dozens of scrapped wooden World War I boats are still extant and visible at low tide at Mallows Bay, along the Potomac River in the Nanjemoy area, the location of what is regarded as the "largest shipwreck fleet in the Western Hemisphere"    Famous people born in Nanjemoy include Raphael Semmes,   captain of the Confederate cruiser "Alabama", and Matthew Henson,   with whom Robert Peary explored the Arctic in 1909 and with Peary may have discovered the North Pole. Wild areas  The Nanjemoy area, on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, includes the largest great blue heron (Ardea herodias) rookery in the Eastern United States north of Florida, now a preserve owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy.  The area also includes Purse State Park, well known for its fossil shark teeth, Turritella snails, and other fossils of Paleocene geological age,   and other protected wild areas along the Potomac River's freshwater tidal (estuarine) shore.  Smallwood State Park, the Chicamuxen Wildlife Management Area, the Doncaster Demonstration Forest and Chapel Point State Park are also nearby.The Nanjemoy Creek Environmental Education Center, operated by the Charles County Public School system, is located along Nanjemoy Creek. It offers trails, a boardwalk through a freshwater tidal marsh, a pier, a pavilion, a laboratory building, and several cabins for use by school groups.     An observatory there, operated by the Southern Maryland Astronomical Society, has a dome formerly used nearby at a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory facility.  RecreationHunting and fishing have long been popular in the relatively undeveloped Nanjemoy area, and many miles of remote hiking trails are available.  More recently, the area's scenic, little-traveled roads have become popular with cyclists.Public boat landings are provided on the Potomac at Mallows Bay and on the estuarine portion of Nanjemoy Creek at Friendship Landing, the latter also popular for fishing.    Recreational boaters, mostly from the Woodbridge and Quantico areas on the Virginia side of the Potomac, frequently visit the extensive undeveloped river shore in the Purse State Park area.  Kayaking is also increasing in popularity in the area, both on the Potomac and on the quiet tidewaters of Nanjemoy Creek. References  External links  Nanjemoy community website      
Marshall Hall, Maryland   Marshall Hall, Maryland is the site of the Marshall family mansion. It is now part of Piscataway Park operated by the National Park Service. Marshall Hall is located near Bryan's Road in Charles County, Maryland, next to the Potomac River, more or less across from Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of George Washington.  The home was one of the finest built on the Maryland shore of the Potomac in the early 18th century.  The Marshall family were minor gentry and owned as many as 80 slaves by the early 19th century.Soon after the Civil War, the site became a highly frequented picnic ground because of its proximity to Mount Vernon. Steamship lines, originally established to ferry tourists from Washington D.C. and Alexandria to/from Mount Vernon, discovered a new source of revenue in the park across from the historic estate. In the 1880s, the Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall Steamboat Company ran large ships between Washington, Alexandria, Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall: the round-trip fare at that time was $1, and included admission to Mount Vernon.  Washingtonians fled the summer heat of the city for all sorts of events at the picnic grounds, from exclusive catered events to popular cultural events such as a swimming exhibition given by the daredevil Robert Emmet Odlum in the summer of 1878, seven years before his death at the Brooklyn Bridge.  Marshall Hall later became one of the first amusement parks in the Washington, DC area in the 1890s, offering numerous "appliances of entertainment" (as one deed described them) for visitors who wanted to do more than picnic, many of them arriving by river boat.  By the early 20th century, annual jousting tournaments took place at the site.  New attractions were added throughout the 20th century, and gambling became a major draw for a while after World War II.  Between 1949 and 1968, the Southern Maryland area offered the only legal slot machines in the United States outside of Nevada.The National Park Service gained control of the park after Congress, acting upon a request from the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, mandated that the views from Mt. Vernon had to be protected and returned to something resembling the days when George Washington sat on his colonnaded porch and looked across the Potomac. The term "historic viewshed" was coined for this act of preservation.  The Park Service tore down all vestiges of the amusement park in 1980, whose popularity had declined due to competition by much larger, newer parks.  A fire destroyed much of the colonial house soon after.  In January 2003, a truck driver slammed his rig through the remaining hulk.  The damage done to the brick shell was repaired the following year.

William Hemsley (Maryland)    William Hemsley (January 23, 1737 – June 5, 1812) was an American planter and political leader from Maryland. He represented Maryland in the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783.Hemsley’s entire life was closely connected with his family’s plantation, Clover Fields Farm, in Queen Anne's County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. The family had been established there and in Talbot County for several generations. His career of public service was similar to that of many prominent planters. He was a county official in both counties at various times, and served as a Colonel in the militia of Queen Anne’s County during the Revolutionary War.Hemsley was first elected to the Maryland state senate in November 1779. He would serve in that body until 1781. Then in 1782-1783 he served in the Continental Congress in New York. He was again elected to the state senate in 1784, but declined that election. He would serve again from 1786 to 1789. Although re-elected again in 1790, he did not serve. He was a member of the Maryland Convention that ratified the United States Constitution on April 28, 1788.His later years were spent running the family plantation. He died there on June 5, 1812 and was buried in the family’s cemetery on the farm, near Queenstown, Maryland. His son, William Hemsley, Jr., also served in the state senate in 1799–1800.

Maryland Institute College of Art     Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) is an art and design college in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.  It was founded in 1826 as the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts,    making it one of the first and oldest art colleges in the United States. In 2008, MICA was ranked #2 in the nation among fine arts  programs by U.S. News and World Report,  and its Graphic Design Master of Fine Arts program tied for #6 among graduate schools for Graphic Design.  MICA is also a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD), a consortium of thirty-six leading art schools in the United States, as well as the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). The school is located in the Bolton Hill neighborhood, along Mount Royal Ave.  The main campus is about   from downtown Baltimore.MICA hosts pre-college, post-baccalaureate, continuing studies, Masters of Fine Arts, and Bachelors of Fine Arts programs, as well as weekend young peoples' studio art classes. History The "Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts" was established in 1826. One instrumental figure in the Institute's founding was noted local writer, lawyer, civic leader and inventor John H. B. Latrobe,  son of Benjamin Henry Latrobe, designer of the "United States Capitol" and the "Old Baltimore Cathedral" (now the "Basilica of the Assumption") on Cathedral Street and the old "Merchants Exchange" at South Gay and Lombard Streets (a domed 'H'-shaped building of Federal offices and maritime businesses, the largest in America). The first home of the Institute was called "The Athenaeum", and was situated at the intersection of St. Paul and East Lexington Streets in downtown Baltimore. It was destroyed by fire caused by a bank riot due to the financial panic following the collapse of several Baltimore banks on February 7, 1835. Classes resumed 12 years later in 1849 in rented space over the downtown Baltimore Post Office in the "Merchants Exchange".    In 1851, the Institute moved from the Post Office/Exchange Building to its own building, built above the Centre Market on East Baltimore Street alongside the Jones Falls stream to the Baltimore Harbor. The building covered an entire block and had two stories built on a series of brick arches above the market, with two towers at each end.During this period the Maryland Institute adds a School of Chemistry, thanks in part to philanthropist George Peabody (for which the Peabody Institute is named) and B&O President Thomas Swann, and a School of Music.  Night classes for Design are added for men who work during the day but would like training in Architecture and Engineering at night. In 1854, a Day School of Design opened for women—one of the first arts programs for women in the country. In 1860, the Day School for men opened, and in 1870 the Day school became co-ed, offering instruction in the fine arts for both men and women. For 79 years the Institute was housed in the same location above the market, and its Great Hall, large enough to accommodate 6,000, attracted many famous speakers and lecturers. It not only hosted events and shows related to the Arts, but being one of the largest halls in Baltimore, it hosted important events to the city and the region as well. In 1852, it hosted the National political party conventions to nominate presidential candidates of both  Gen. Winfield Scott(Whigs) and his opponent Franklin Pierce (Democrats) of New Hampshire (who was later elected 14th President of the United States). During the American Civil War, the Institute served briefly as an armory for the Union and a hospital for soldiers wounded at the Battle of Antietam.  On April 16, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln gave his famous speech known as the "Baltimore Address" during a "Sanitary Fair" held in the Great Hall to benefit Union soldiers and families (an early charitable organization and cause similar to the later American Red Cross and the USO - United Service Organization).On February 7-8, 1904, the Centre Market building burned down along with 1,500 other buildings in downtown Baltimore during the Great Baltimore Fire.  Temporarily, classes are moved to spaces above other covered markets in the city, while construction begins in two locations. Michael Jenkins donated the future site of the "Main Building", (opening in 1908) which was to house the School of Art and Design, and the City of Baltimore offered the site and funding to rebuild the Centre Market building for the Drafting school.    Upon opening, the "Main Building" had spaces for pottery, metal working, wood carving, free-hand drafting, and textile design, as well as a library, galleries and exhibition rooms. The galleries and exhibition rooms were important, because at the time of construction, Baltimore still did not have a public art museum  (institutions such as the Walters Art Gallery were not founded until 1909 and acquired by the city 1934 and the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1914).In 1923, the Institute's galleries hosted the first known public showing of Henri Matisse's work in the United States, brought over from Europe by sisters Claribel and Etta Cone.  In 1928, the new Centre Market building, now known as "The Market Place" building, offers a course in Aeronautics theory and drafting following the great excitement and increase in interest in the industry following Lindbergh's flight over the Atlantic Ocean to Paris.The Institute legally changed its name to the "Maryland Institute, College of Art" in 1959, and the "Market Place Building" was razed to make room for the extension south of the Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83).  The consolidation of MICA to the Mount Royal campus is furthered by the purchase of the Mount Royal Station, a former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) train station, in 1964. In 1968, MICA was forced to close for the first time in its history since its first fire in 1835 due to the Baltimore riot of 1968 that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.In 1972–1975, MICA was graced with the presence of a number of famous artists and critics of the period, including composer John Cage, poet Allen Ginsberg, photographer Walker Evans, master printer Kenneth E. Tyler, painter Elaine de Kooning, and art critic Clement Greenberg. In the following years, MICA expanded rapidly along Mount Royal Avenue, adding the "Fox Building" in 1978, the "College Center" (now the "Art Tech Center") in 1986, a renovation of the "Main Building" in 1990, "The Commons" (added 1992), "Bunting Center" (1998), the "Meyerhoff House" (2002), the "Brown Center" (2003), the "Studio Center" (2007), and "The Gateway" (2008).  During that time, the College focused on increased interaction with the international art world—offering study abroad programs and residences in numerous countries around the world. BuildingsMICA's campus is a milieu of diverse buildings from different periods of Baltimore's development. Main building  Construction began on a new Maryland Institute campus in Bolton Hill when its Centre Market building on East Baltimore Street at the Jones Falls was destroyed in the Great Baltimore Fire of February 7-8, 1904, and construction was completed four years later in 1908.    The State of Maryland, the Carnegie Foundation, and a number of local benefactors contributed funds to build the "Main Building". Michael Jenkins donated the land on which the "Main Building" was built, stipulating that the new building not clash with the nearby Gothic Revival Corpus Christi Church.  The "Main Building" was the first building designed by New York-based architects Pell & Corbett, who were awarded the contract when they won a $500 design contest sponsored by the New York Association of Independent Architects. Otto Fuchs designed the interior studio plans. The architecture was designed to evoke a feeling of the Grand Canal of Venice, c. 1400. The exterior marble is carved from "Beaver Dam" marble, excavated from the famed Baltimore County quarry near Cockeysville, Maryland. It is the same marble used to build the Washington Monument in Baltimore designed by Robert Mills, and part of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.. Important architectural features include the impressive main entrance, with large marble staircase, stained-glass skylight and the names of Renaissance masters surrounding the entrance to the second floor. The exterior of the northeast façade features four stone memorial medallions: one for the city, one for the state, and two others honoring Institute benefactors Andrew Carnegie and Michael Jenkins.  Throughout the "Main Building" there are also plaster replicas of Greek and Roman statues that students are often required to make studies of their Foundation year.In 1908, the New York Association of Independent Architects awarded the building a gold key, the highest award in architecture at the time.From 1990 through 1992, the building underwent a major, $5.1 million renovation under the direction of architects Grieves, Worrell, Wright & O’Hatnick, Inc. The renovation upgraded the building’s facilities and created additional academic and office space while retaining much of the original design and décor. The Main Building houses painting and drawing studios, undergraduate photography department, foundation department, two departmental galleries, undergraduate admissions and the President's Office.   Mount Royal Station    Built in 1896, the Mount Royal Station (now known as The Station Building) was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's showcase passenger station until it ceased its operations at the Station in 1961. MICA purchased the building in 1964 and renovated the building in 1966 under the direction of architect Richard Donkervoet, who took pains to retain as much of the building’s exterior appearance as possible, and also preserved much of the interior character, including vaulted ceilings, columns, and mosaic floor. Architectural Forum recognized the Mount Royal Station renovation for "sensitivity by later architects to the initial conception by the original," and Margaret Mead, in a lecture given at the Station, commented that the renovation "is perhaps the most magnificent example in the Western World of something being made into something else".On December 8, 1976, the Station was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks, granting it full protection as an historic site. The Mount Royal Station’s train shed, one of the country’s last remaining such structures, was renovated in 1985 due to advanced deterioration of the shed’s materials. In 1992, the AIA's Baltimore chapter honored the Maryland Institute and architects Cochran, Stevenson & Donkervoet with a 25 Year Award for Excellence in Design of Enduring Significance for their adaptive reuse of the Mount Royal Station.Between 2005–2007, MICA accomplished a two-phased, $6.3 million renovation of the building by the architectural firm Grieves, Worrall, Wright & O’Hatnick, Inc. The first phase, renovation of the interior, was completed in Fall 2005: interior finishes, such as the mosaic tile flooring, marble columns, tin ceilings, wood wainscot, and trim were cleaned and restored. Classroom space was also increased, as well as the quality and quantity of studio space. The second phase, restoration of the building's exterior and train shed, was completed in Spring 2007: stonework and wood were cleaned, repaired, and repainted, the slate canopy restored, and the drainage system fixed; clerestory and structural timbers in the train shed were replaced and the steel roof framing was reinforced. In keeping with the pedestrian landscaping and streetscape that MICA has created along Mount Royal Avenue, a new plaza with benches, bike racks, shrubs, and ornamental grasses and ground cover was added.The Mount Royal Station currently houses the undergraduate departments of fiber and interdisciplinary sculpture, 3-D classrooms, and the Rinehart School of Sculpture, as well as senior studios. The railroad tracks underneath the train shed remain active as CSX Transportation's freight mainline to New York City. Dolphin BuildingThe Dolphin Building at 100 Dolphin Street houses MICA's Printmaking department and Book Arts and Printmaking concentrations, as well as the independent Dolphin Press. It has   of working space divided into three floors. The building houses lithography and intaglio / etching studios on the first floor, screenprinting, and letterpress studios with photo printmaking facilities on the second floor, and a papermaking studio, lecture/computer lab and Senior studios on the third floor.  Bunting Center  The acquisition and renovation of Bunting Center increased MICA’s academic space by 20% when it opened in 1998. The new building was named for trustee George Bunting, who was instrumental in the development of the Fox Building among other projects.Bunting Center houses Liberal Arts departments (art history and language, literature, and culture), academic advising and the registrar. Bunting Center also houses one of the four places to eat on campus,  Java Corner. The first and second floors house the Decker Library, which houses a large collection of artists' books in a climate-controlled room called "The Cage". Students are allowed to look at any book in the collection. The remainder of the library is divided into the Quarto, which hold oversized books, and the Stacks, which hold normal-sized books. Adjacent to the Decker Library is the Media Resources Collection, which has more than 120,000 slides for teachers to use in presentations, as well as videos and audio tapes.Additionally, Bunting Center contains the Pinkard Gallery and Student Space Gallery.The Bunting Center received the Grand Design Award and Honor Award from AIABaltimore in 1998. In 2007, architect Steve Ziger headed the building’s $5.5 million renovation, seeking to create “a real sense of neighborhood” for the college. Firehouse  MICA purchased a historic Firehouse along North Avenue in 2001 and renovated the building in 2003 to house the College’s operations and facilities management department. The building has   of space. As part of the redevelopment agreement, MICA maintained the station’s front façade in accordance with Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation standards. Renovation architect for the project was Cho Benn Holback + Associates, Inc. Kajima Construction Services was the contractor. The Firehouse won an award from the Baltimore Heritage Foundation for preservation in 2004. Fox Building   Built in 1915 as the Cannon Shoe Factory, the Fox Building was purchased in 1976. After two years of planning by architects Ayers/Saint/Gross, work began in 1979 and the newly renovated building opened in 1980. This renovation retained most of the warehouse character of the building, including exposed ductwork and framing and the original exterior—providing more than   of usable space. The renovations cost $2.5 million, and the building was named for architect Charles J. Fox, a 1965 graduate of MICA whose family contributed over $1.5 million of the renovation cost. After the conversion, the Mount Royal Improvement Association granted MICA an Award of Merit for its contribution to the community.In 2005, a second renovation of the Fox Building added Decker Gallery and Café Doris. The building also houses Meyerhoff Gallery, Center for Art Education, Division of Continuing Studies, as well as Ceramics, Illustration, Environmental Design, GFA, Drawing and Painting departments, the woodshop, and the nature library. Bank Building (Studio Center)  MICA purchased the former Jos. A. Bank sewing plant on North Avenue in August 2000. The all brick building dates back to the early 20th century and was home to Morgan Millwork for most of the century until Jos. A. Bank Clothiers bought it for a sewing plant. The   building houses the post-baccalaureate certificate program, Hoffberger School of Painting, The Mount Royal School of Art, the Graduate Photographic and Electronic Media program, and Senior student studios. Although the official name is The Studio Center, many students know it as The Bank Building.  Brown Center The first newly constructed academic building for the College in nearly a hundred years, Brown Center was dedicated on October 17, 2003 and became fully operational in January 2004.   Bolstered by a $6 million gift from Eddie and Sylvia Brown, the largest gift ever received by the Institute, the Brown Center houses MICA’s digital art and design programs, as well as the 525-seat Falvey Hall, which, in addition to hosting school-related functions, has also played host to events like the Maryland Film Festival and National Portfolio Day. The building was designed by architect Charles Brickbauer and Ziger/Snead LLP.   In addition to Falvey Hall, the Brown Center houses the Video, Interactive Design, Animation, and BFA and MFA Graphic Design departments. Most of the computer labs in the Brown Center are Macintosh computers, though there are two labs with PC computers for 3D animation. It also has an art gallery, a secondary hall for lectures ("Brown 320"), and a "Black-Box" area for Interactive Media installations.The  , five-story contemporary structure has garnered wide acclaim as an architectural landmark. Awards have included the AIABaltimore 2004 Grand Design Award, AIA Maryland 2004 Honor Award of Excellence, regional award of merit in 2004 in the International Illumination Design Award competition, and several awards for excellence in construction. In addition, MICA President Fred Lazarus traveled to Italy in June 2006 to receive the Dedalo Minosse International Prize for Brown Center. Brown Center was the only American project among the finalists. Additional facilities  Additional buildings making up MICA's campus include the Maryland Institute College of Art shop (known simply as "The MICA Store") at 1200 Mount Royal Avenue, where most of the students get supplies for their projects and books for their classes, and where visitors can purchase official MICA merchandise.The Art Tech Center at 1206-1208 Mount Royal Avenue has facilities for large-format printing (up to 44" x ∞"), laser-cutting and 3D printing. Additionally, it houses the Tech Desk, for students to rent out technology like digital cameras, projectors and computers.Other facilities include the Jewelry Center at Meadow Mill, Kramer House, Main Building Annex (administrative offices and alumni relations), and The Center for Design Practice and Dolphin Press & Print @ MICA archives at 1210 Mount Royal Ave. Student housing The Commons   MICA's first official student housing facility, The Commons is a three-building, four-story student apartment complex. Among the first student residences to be constructed on the apartment-living model, it houses approximately 350 students. When MICA proposed purchasing a lot on McMechen Street that had been vacant for more than 30 years to build the Commons, the Bolton Hill neighborhood not only approved the purchase, but also gave $50,000 in donations. Built in 1991, inside the Commons is MICA's largest green space and above the Gatehouse is an area for Student Organization meetings.In 2000, American School and University included The Commons in its Architectural Portfolio awards, citing Mahan Rykiel Associates for their Landscape Architecture work on the project. The Maryland/Potomac Chapters of the American Society of Landscape Architects also gave the project an award.  Meyerhoff House Meyerhoff House opened in August 2002 as a residence for Sophomore, Junior and Senior students. The building includes the College’s main dining facility, student life center, and recreational amenities. Originally built as the Hospital for the Women of Maryland, the building had been used as nursing home for some time until it closed in 1994. The building was vacant for 7 years until MICA purchased it in January 2001.  The Gateway Construction began on The Gateway in October 2006 and completed in August 2008. It was designed by RTKL Associates Inc., and is located at the intersection of Mount Royal and North avenues, alongside the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83).The Meyerhoff and The Gateway buildings increased MICA student housing 90% between 2002 and 2009, allowing more students to stay on campus. The Gateway includes apartments to accommodate 217 student residents, a translucent studio tower, a multi-use performance space, the College’s largest student exhibition gallery, and a new home for the Joseph Meyerhoff Center for Career Development. In August 2008, the first students moved into the Gateway. Students and alumni   Approximately 1,850 undergraduate students and 250 graduate students hail from 48 states and 53 foreign countries. The student body is 66% female, 34% male, 22% minorities and international students, and 97% traditional college-age. Sixty-five percent of MICA students receive some form of financial aid. Among the most selective art colleges in the United States, MICA has consistently enrolled more Presidential Scholars in the Visual Arts than any other college or university in the nation, and in the last several years has enrolled approximately 2/3 of those who received Scholastic Arts' Gold Portfolio award. In 11 of the last 14 years, a MICA student has won the National Student Art Achievement Award, which is given by the National Art Education Association for outstanding studio achievement in candidates for teaching.MICA's approximately 10,000 alumni living in 58 countries have won international awards, attended graduate programs, exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the world, and are represented in public and private collections across the globe. 86%  of B.F.A. graduates who take jobs immediately after graduation are working in art related fields; 23% of MICA's B.F.A. graduates pursue graduate study immediately after graduation.In the past eight years, 14 MICA graduates have received Fulbright awards for study abroad and five students have earned the Jacob Javits Fellowship for graduate study. Since 2003, two alumni have received the national Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Graduate Scholarship and three Jack Kent Cooke Foundation scholars have also chosen to study at MICA. Additionally, four alumni have been awarded Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Grants.

Eastern Shore of Maryland  The Eastern Shore of Maryland is a part of the U.S. state of Maryland that lies predominantly on the east side of the Chesapeake Bay and consists of nine counties. As of the 2010 census, its population was 449,226, with just under 8 percent of Marylanders living in the region. The term "Eastern Shore" distinguishes a territorial part of the State of Maryland from the Western Shore of Maryland, land west of the Chesapeake Bay. GeographyThe Eastern Shore consists of the nine counties of Maryland that lie on the east side of Chesapeake Bay or the east side of the Susquehanna River (the western border of Cecil County with Harford County). It is bounded to the north by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (across the Mason-Dixon Line), to the east and north by the state of Delaware, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Maryland's and Virginia's Eastern Shore and the state of Delaware are part of the Delmarva Peninsula.The counties in Maryland occupying the Eastern Shore are Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester counties. To the south, the Calvert-Scarborough Line separates the Eastern Shore of Maryland from that of Virginia. A modern Worcester County highway map (PDF) shows its location. While not exactly where it was laid down in the 17th-18th century, it has moved little once everyone could agree on where Watkins Point, on the western side of the peninsula, is and where the shore of the Bay began (since the bay side peters out into marshes and wetlands).  In 1668, Philip (Calvert -ed.)obtained recognition from Virginia of Maryland's claims to what is now Somerset County and actually participated in the survey of the dividing line between the two colonies with the Surveyor General of Virginia, Edmund Scarborough. At about the same time, he negotiated treaties with Lower Eastern Shore Indian tribes who were harassing English settlers. The terms of these treaties established rules of behavior in Indian-English relations that applied to whites as well as Indians, and on the whole, kept peace in the area thereafter.   The northern limit is harder to place. Some dispute Cecil County as a true Shore county, because of the presence of Interstate 95 and related development, the county's proximity to and influence from nearby urban areas such as Philadelphia and Wilmington, and its position straddling the Elk River — leaving half geographically west of the Shore, if the Elk River is taken as its northern edge.Land and water both figure in the argument about whether Cecil County is part of the Eastern Shore, and so do man-made features.Like New Castle County, Delaware, Cecil County is crossed by the fall line, a geologic division where the rockier highlands of the Piedmont region meet the Atlantic coastal plain, a flat, sandy area that forms the coast. The coastal plain includes the Delmarva Peninsula and hence the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The geology of Delmarva is an inseparable part of the Eastern Shore, which has few rocky outcrops south of Kent County.The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal crosses from Back Creek on the Elk River to Port Penn, Delaware. While it was a shallow canal with locks after its construction in 1829, it was deepened in the early 20th century to sea level, and physically separates the Delmarva Peninsula from the rest of the United States. Maryland south of the canal is considered the Eastern Shore by residents. The term Western Shore is used by Eastern Shore residents to describe all the counties of Maryland west of the Chesapeake Bay, but especially those of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area and Southern Maryland.The north-south section of the Mason-Dixon Line forms the border between Maryland and Delaware. The border was originally marked every mile by a stone, and every five miles by a "crownstone". The line is not quite due north and south, but is as straight as survey methods of the 1760s could make it. It was surveyed as a compromise solution to a century-long wrangle between the Penn and Calvert families of England. If the Chesapeake Bay/Delaware Bay watershed divide had been taken as the borderline, Delaware would be about half its current size.Finally, although this has received less attention than other parts of Eastern Shore culture, commercial east-west ties between Delaware towns and Maryland towns were culturally significant in Colonial and Early American periods despite the border line (which largely cut through woods and swamps). Trade with Philadelphia was conducted by overland routes to Delaware towns like Odessa (then called Cantwell's Bridge) and Smyrna (then called Duck Creek). Agricultural products and milled grain were taken up the Delaware River by "shallop men" in small vessels called shallops. These cultural connections continue to this day.Ocean City is a modern resort on what was once called the "seaside" or "seaboard side." It is on a long north-south sandspit that is essentially a barrier island.  History Early historyWilliam Claiborne was granted land (part of the Colony of  Virginia) in 1629 and named the land "Kent County". In 1631, he sailed north up the Chesapeake Bay from its south and west side to the area known today as Kent Island. There he made a fortified settlement that is considered to be the first English settlement within the Province of Maryland. Talbot County was formed in 1662. Cecil County was formed in 1674, by proclamation of the Governor, from eastern portions of Baltimore County and northern portion of Kent County. Wicomico County was formed in 1867, as the 9th and last county, created from Somerset and Worcester counties. Formation and etymology of the counties  1642 Kent County-In 1642, the governor and council appointed commissioners for the Isle and County of Kent. This act appears to have led to the establishment of Kent County, name after Kent County, England. 1661 Talbot County- named for Lady Grace Talbot, the wife of Sir Robert Talbot, an Irish statesman, and the sister of Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. 1666 Somerset County-named for Mary, Lady Somerset, the wife of Sir John Somerset and daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour. 1669 Dorchester County-Named for the Earl of Dorset, a family friend of the Calverts (the founding family of the Maryland colony). 1674 Cecil County. 1706 Queen Anne's County- formed from northern parts of Talbot and southern portions of Kent. Name after Queen Anne of Great Britain who reigned when the county was established. 1742 Worcester County-named for an Earl of Worcester. 1773 Caroline County- formed from parts of Dorchester and Queen Anne's counties. The county derives its name from Lady Caroline Eden, wife of Maryland's last colonial governor of the Province of Maryland, Robert Eden. 1867 Wicomico County.   Later historyOcean City was founded on July 4, 1875,  when the Atlantic Hotel opened on Assateague Island. At the time, Assateague Island was continuous from the Delaware state line to well south of Ocean City: the Ocean City Inlet wasn't formed until a hurricane in August 1933 cut across the south end of the town, although the inlet was cut not by waves sweeping inland, but by 4 or 5 days' worth of freshwater runoff from the coastal creeks running seaward.  By 1935, government money had built jetties to make the inlet permanent, dividing Fenwick Island (north) from Assateague Island (south).  Early transportation to the island was by train.Until the 1820s, travel and commerce between the Eastern Shore and Baltimore were less important than the connections between it and Philadelphia. Water travel by sailboat and steamer linked the Eastern Shore to Baltimore more tightly beginning about 1813, when the first steamboat traveled the Bay. By the 1880s, railroad lines linked the Eastern Shore to Philadelphia and later, Norfolk, Virginia, by way of a railroad line straight south from Wilmington to Dover, Delmar, Salisbury, and Cape Charles. Maryland's Eastern Shore was served by branch lines running generally southwest from the main route. See List of railroad lines in the Delmarva Peninsula. The Eastern Shore's many branchlines were built after the Civil War by local companies; eventually all were controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad (which also bought control of the steamboat and ferry routes), then Conrail, and now Norfolk Southern.An east-west rail route ran from a ferry terminal at Claiborne, west of St. Michaels, to Ocean City, via the Baltimore and Eastern Shore Railroad and the Wicomico and Pocomoke Railroad. Travelers could also take a ferry to Love Point on Kent Island, board a Queen Anne's Railroad train, and travel east to Lewes and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.Automobile transportation across the Chesapeake Bay was by ferryboat until 1952, when the first Chesapeake Bay Bridge was opened for traffic.In the late 1950s and early 1960s developers began selling lots on Assateague Island, south of the inlet. However, a storm on March 6, 1962 destroyed houses, shacks, and roads.   The state and federal governments intervened before reconstruction by creating the Assateague Island National Seashore and Assateague State Park.An Eastern Shore Baseball League operated on three different occasions between 1922 and 1949.  It was a Class D minor league with teams in all three states of Delmarva. DemographicsAlthough the Eastern Shore comprises more than a third of Maryland's land area, it has a population of 420,792 (2004 census estimate), about 8% of Maryland's population.The most populous city on the Eastern Shore is Salisbury, and the most populous county is Wicomico County. The Salisbury metropolitan area is the only metropolitan statistical area and the only Combined Statistical Area is the Salisbury-Ocean Pines CSA. GovernmentThough five of the nine counties have a majority of Democratic-registered voters, the Eastern Shore is somewhat more socially conservative than the Baltimore area.  Most of the counties on the Shore tend to support Republicans in presidential and gubernatorial elections.  At the local level, three of the state senators representing substantial portions of the Shore are Republicans and two are Democrats, while 11 of the region's state delegates are Republicans and four are Democrats.Currently the entire Eastern Shore is in Maryland's 1st Congressional district.   Nine-term Republican congressman Wayne Gilchrest was defeated for his party's nomination in February 2008. The 2008 race for Congress was won by Frank Kratovil, the first Democrat to represent the district in Washington, DC, since 1991, narrowly defeating Republican Andy Harris by less than 3,000 votes. Harris defeated Kratovil in 2010. Economy TourismOcean City has been a tourist destination for Baltimoreans and Marylanders in general, thus rendering the flavor of Ocean City life unlike that of the rest of the Shore.  The skyline, containing many tall hotels and condominiums, is in contrast to the rest of Delmarva.  On the southern end of Ocean City is a recreational boardwalk spanning over thirty blocks and containing carnival rides and games, restaurants, bars, arcades, and clothing boutiques.Other tourist destinations include the town of St. Michaels on a neck surrounded by water; the colonial former port of Oxford; Chestertown; and isolated Smith Island in the Chesapeake Bay. North of Crisfield is Janes Island State Park, which has camping and kayaking trails through marshlands. FishingAt the southern end of the Chesapeake coast of Maryland, the town of Crisfield is home to a fishing, crabbing, and seafood processing industry. AgricultureThe main economic activities on the Eastern Shore are vegetable and grain farming, seafood, large-scale chicken breeding (Perdue Farms was founded in Salisbury and is headquartered there today), and tourism. Tobacco was grown during colonial times. The agricultural economy switched to grain in the second quarter of the 18th century.   Infrastructure Transportation  WaterwaysVarious waterways provide a medium for commerce and boaters: the Atlantic Ocean; Chesapeake Bay; the Susquehanna River; and the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. RoadsThere are three major routes onto the Shore:  The Chesapeake Bay Bridge spans   of the Chesapeake Bay, and at the time of construction in 1952, was the longest continuous over-water steel structure.  A second parallel span was added in 1973 and a third has been discussed, most recently in 2006. A third span will not open, according to state officials, until about 2025. The bridges made Kent Island, site of the first English settlement on the Shore, into a bedroom community for Washington, Annapolis, and Baltimore. Kent Island is part of Queen Anne's County. U.S. Route 13 Maryland Route 213  The two major highways on the Eastern Shore are U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 50, which meet in Salisbury. AirportsThe Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport, in Salisbury,   is the only commercial airport on the Delmarva Peninsula.Airports for private planes include:  Bay Bridge Airport in Stevensville  Cambridge-Dorchester Airport in Cambridge  Crisfield Municipal Airport in Crisfield.  Easton Airport, in Easton  Ocean City Municipal Airport in Ocean City    SecessionThe Eastern Shore has always been a distinctive region, and has several times attempted to split off from the state of Maryland. Proposals have been debated in the Maryland General Assembly in 1833-1835, 1852 and recently in 1998 for the Eastern Shore becoming its own state. Early proposals encompassed a state of the entire Delmarva Peninsula. The proposal in 1998 by state Senators Richard F. Colburn and J. Lowell Stoltzfus did not specify the status of the nine counties of the Eastern Shore after secession,  but did suggest the name of the new state could be "Delmarva".  SportsThe Delmarva Shorebirds are a minor league baseball team who play Class A baseball in the South Atlantic League at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium in Salisbury, affiliated with the Baltimore Orioles. CulturalSalisbury hosts the largest bicycling event east of the Mississippi - the Seagull Century; the nation's second-largest KCBS barbecue competition - Pork in the Park; and two major Maryland wine and craft beer festivals. Easton hosts a three-day artist event, the Waterfowl Festival, every November. Duck and goose hunting from blinds is a popular activity using carved wooden duck decoys, which can also be prized works of art.  Media references    The 2005 film Wedding Crashers was filmed on locations at Maryland's Eastern Shore, including the historic Inn at Perry Cabin.The Octavia Butler novel Kindred, which uses the science fiction concept of time travel to explore slavery in the United States, is partially set in Maryland's Eastern Shore.

List of current members of the Maryland House of Delegates  The Maryland House of Delegates is the lower house of the Maryland General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. State of Maryland. Three delegates are elected from each district, though some districts are divided into sub-districts. In the original state constitution, four delegates were elected from each county to one-year terms, and two were elected from each of the major early cities of Baltimore and Annapolis. Reforms in the 1830s, however, led to the apportionment of delegates by population rather than geography, and by 1922, delegates served four year terms. The modern system of apportionment of seats began in 1972, when 47 districts of roughly equal population were identified, although sub-districts were created to ensure local representation for areas with too little population to warrant an entire district.Delegates are elected in even years when the President of the United States is not being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent election was in November 2010. Delegates are not term-limited. 2010 elections  General elections were held for all 141 seats in the Maryland House of Delegates on November 2, 2010. The primary elections were held on September 14, 2010.

Maryland Senate     The Maryland Senate, sometimes referred to as the Maryland State Senate, is the upper house of the General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland. Composed of 47 senators elected from an equal number of constituent single-member districts, the Senate is responsible, along with the Maryland House of Delegates, for passage of laws in Maryland, and for confirming executive appointments made by the Governor of Maryland.It evolved from the upper house of the colonial assembly created in 1650 when Maryland was a proprietary colony controlled by Cecilius Calvert. It consisted of the Governor and members of the Governor's appointed council. With slight variation, the body to meet in that form until 1776, when Maryland, now a state independent of British rule, passed a new constitution that created an electoral college to appoint members of the Senate. This electoral college was abolished in 1838 and members began to be directly elected from each county and Baltimore City. In 1972, because of a Supreme Court decision, the number of districts was increased to 47, and the districts were balanced by population rather than being geographically determined.To serve in the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 years of age or older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years coincident with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; the rest of the year the work of the Senate is light and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.Senators elect a President to serve as presiding officer of the legislative body, as well as a President Pro Tempore. The President appoints chairs and membership of six standing committees, four legislative committees as well as the Executive Nominations and Rules Committees. When compared to other state legislatures in the United States, the Maryland Senate has one of the strongest presiding officers and some of the strongest committee chairs. Senators are also organized into caucuses, including party- and demographically-based caucuses. They are assisted in their work by paid staff of the non-partisan Department of Legislative Services and by partisan office staff. History The origins of the Maryland Senate lie in the creation of an assembly during the early days of the Maryland colony. This assembly first met in 1637, making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States.    Originally, the assembly was unicameral, but in 1650, the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the upper house of a now bicameral legislature. These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors of the Maryland colony, Cecilius Calvert and his descendants. Thus, the upper house in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house, which was elected, tended to be more populist, and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony.   The upper house was briefly abolished during the English Civil War, as Puritan governors attempted to consolidate control and prevent the return of any proprietary influence. It was again abolished by Governor Josias Fendall in 1660, who sought to create a colonial government based on an elected unicameral legislature like that of the Virginia colony. The position of Governor was removed from the legislature in 1675, but for the following century, its function and powers largely remained the same. In 1776, following the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Maryland threw off proprietary control and established a new constitution. Under this new constitution, the upper house of the General Assembly first became known as the Maryland Senate. The new body consisted of fifteen Senators appointed to five-year terms by an electoral college. The college, made up of two electors from each county and one each from the cities of Baltimore and Annapolis, was limited in its selections only by the stipulation that nine Senators need be from the western shore and six from the eastern shore. The first election under the 1776 constitution took place in 1781, and the system would not change again until 1838. In the interim, a number of problems had cropped up in the appointment process, and the 1838 election saw the passage of a number of constitutional amendments that fundamentally changed how Senators were chosen. The electoral college was abolished, terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such that a third of the senate would be elected every two years, and a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore. The Senate no longer acted as the Governor's Council, although they would continue to confirm the Governor's appointments. Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851, when terms were shortened to four years, and 1864, when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one, but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not come again until 1964. In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. Sims that state legislative seats must be apportioned on the principle of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented. A special session of the legislature in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so in such a way as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.  Powers and legislative process The Maryland Senate, as the upper house of the bicameral Maryland General Assembly, shares with the Maryland House of Delegates the responsibility for making laws in the state of Maryland. Bills are often developed in the period between sessions of the General Assembly by the Senate's standing committees or by individual Senators. They are then submitted by Senators to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services for drafting of legislative language. Between 2000 and 2005, an average of 907 bills was introduced in the Senate annually during the three-month legislative session. The bill is submitted, and receives the first of three constitutionally mandated readings on the floor of the Senate, before being assigned to a committee.    The decision about whether legislation passes is often made in the committees. Committees can hold legislation and prevent it from reaching the Senate floor. The recommendations of committees on bills carry tremendous weight; it is rare for the Senate as a whole to approve legislation that has received a negative committee report.  Once a committee has weighed in on a piece of legislation, the bill returns to the floor for second hearing, called the "consideration of committee" report, and a third hearing, which happens just before the floor vote on it. Once passed by the Senate, a bill is sent to the House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with amendments or ask for the establishment of a conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn it. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a new term, since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it. Unlike the House of Delegates, the Senate has the sole responsibility in the state's legislative branch for confirming gubernatorial appointees to positions that require confirmation. After the Governor forwards his nomination to the Senate, the Executive Nominations Committee reviews the nominee and makes a recommendation for confirmation or rejection to the Senate as a whole.  Only one gubernatorial nominee in recent history has been rejected; Lynn Buhl, nominated as Maryland Secretary of the Environment by Governor Robert Ehrlich, was rejected over concerns about her qualifications.  The Senate also has sole responsibility for trying any persons that have been impeached by the House of Delegates. They must be sworn in before such a trial takes place, and a two-thirds majority is required for conviction of the impeached person.

While each Senator has the power to introduce and vote on bills and make motions on the floor, various committees, caucuses, and leadership positions help to organize the work of the Senate. Senators elect a President of the Senate, who serves as the presiding officer of the chamber. They also elect a President Pro Tempore, who presides over the chamber when the President is absent.  The President of the Maryland Senate has significant influence over legislation that passes through the body through both formal means, such as his ability to appoint committee chairs and leaders of the majority party, and informal means that are less easily defined.    These powers place the President of the Maryland Senate among the strongest state legislature presiding officers in the country. Once legislation is introduced, it is passed to one of the standing committees of the Senate. There are six such committees.  As a whole, the Maryland General Assembly has fewer standing committees than any other state legislature in the United States. Each committee has between 10 and 15 members.  Four of the standing committees deal primarily with legislation; the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judicial Proceedings Committee.  The Chairs of these legislative committees have the power to determine whether their committees will hear a bill, and they therefore have significant influence over legislation.  The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate's responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole. Lastly, the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body. It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced by a member of the Senate after the deadline for submission, and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die.    Along with serving on the Senate committees, members of the Senate also serve on a number of joint committees with members of the House of Delegates.   While the committees are established by formal Senate rules, there are a number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip.  As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates.  The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.   Professional services for members of the Senate and the House of Delegates are provided by the Department of Legislative Services, which is non-partisan. Individual members are also assisted by partisan staff members, and those in leadership positions have additional partisan staff.  These staff members help to manage the offices of the Senators in the Miller Senate Office Building. Each Senator has one year-round administrative assistant, as well as a secretary who assists them during the legislative session. There is also an allowance given to help pay for district offices.    Membership  QualificationsTo be eligible to run for the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen and be at least 25 years old. They must also have lived in the state for at least one year, and must have lived in the district in which they are to run for at least six months, assuming the district has existed with its current boundaries for at least that long. No elected or appointed official of the United States government, including the military, may serve in the Senate, excluding those serving in the military reserves and National Guard. Similarly, no employees of the state government may serve, except for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers.    Elections and vacanciesMembers of the Maryland Senate are elected every four years, in off-year elections in the middle of terms for Presidents of the United States.  Party nominations are determined by primary elections.  The general election for Senate seats and all other state and federal elections in the normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Should a Senate seat become vacant in the middle of a term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat. The 47 districts from which Senators are elected are apportioned every ten years on the basis of population. Maryland's constitution explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.  Salaries and benefitsAs of the 2006–2010 term, most of Maryland's Senators and Delegates receive $43,500 in annual pay while presiding officers earn $56,500.  This pay, relatively low for a state legislator, reflects the part-time nature of the body, which only meets three months out of the year. Most members of the Senate hold additional jobs during the remainder of the year.  Senators can also seek reimbursement for expenses related to meals and lodging during the legislative session, and for certain travel expenses related to their duties at any point during the year. They also have access to benefits received by state employees, including health and life insurance as well as retirement savings plans. Maryland has a voluntary legislator pension plan to which both Senators and Delegates have access. Besides receiving their own benefits, Senators can award up to $138,000 each year in scholarships to students of their choosing if those students meet requirements set by Senate rules.  Current makeup As of February 2011, a majority of seats in the Maryland Senate are held by members of the Democratic Party, with 35 Democrats and 12 Republicans, greater than a two-thirds majority.   This dominance is nothing new, as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African-Americans serve, with women averaging around 30% of the seats and African-Americans around 20%.  LeadershipAs of 2009, Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr. was serving his fifth term as President of the Senate. Nathaniel J. McFadden, from the 45th district in Baltimore, is the President Pro Tempore. The Democratic caucus is led by Robert J. Garagiola, the majority leader, and Lisa A. Gladden, the majority whip. E.J. Pipkin serves as minority leader.  Rules and proceduresMany rules and procedures in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution.  Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee.  The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor.  The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the state constitution.  Seating in the Senate is by party, with the leaders of each party choosing the exact seating assignments.  Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller Senate Office Building.A typical session of the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the previous day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At the discretion of the presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.   Lobbying is common in Annapolis; there are more than 700 lobbyists registered with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns.  Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.

List of current members of the Maryland Senate  The Maryland Senate is the upper house of the Maryland General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. State of Maryland. One Senator is elected from each of the state's 47 electoral districts. As of January 2010, 35 of those seats are held by Democrats and 12 by Republicans. The leader of the Senate is known as the President, a position currently held by Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., who represents Charles and Prince George's counties. In addition, Senators elect a President Pro Tempore, and the respective party caucuses elect a majority and minority leader and a majority and minority whip.Senators are elected in even-numbered years when the President of the United States is not being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent election was in November 2006. Senators are not term-limited. Should a Senator resign from office before his or her term expires, the local central committee of the party to which the retiring senator belonged makes a recommendation to the Governor for whom to appoint to the open seat. It is tradition for the Governor to appoint the recommended person.  Four of the current members of the Maryland State Senate were originally appointed, two of whom have since been elected in their own right.  Newly elected Senators are sworn in and begin work on the second Wednesday of the January following their election. Each Senator has at least one standing committee assignment. The first is to one of the four legislative committees: Budget and Taxation; Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs (listed in this table as Education, Health, and Environment); Finance; or Judicial Proceedings. A number of Senators have secondary committee assignments, most prominently to the Executive Nominations Committee, which oversees the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to approve nominations by the Governor. Assignment to the Rules or Executive Nominations committees or to any Ad Hoc committees is not noted.

McCulloch versus Maryland 
McCulloch Versus Maryland 
George Howard, Governor of Maryland 
McGowan v. Maryland     McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961),  was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that laws with religious origins are not unconstitutional if they have secular purpose. BackgroundThe Court rejected an establishment clause challenge to laws requiring that most large-scale commercial enterprises remain closed on Sundays. The Court's review of the history demonstrated that Sunday closing laws were originally efforts to promote church attendance. "But, despite the strongly religious origin of these laws, non religious arguments for Sunday closing began to be heard more distinctly."The Court said that the Constitution does not ban federal or state regulation of conduct whose reason or effect merely happens to coincide with the tenets of some or all religions. It concluded that, as presently written and administered, most Sunday closing laws are of a secular rather than religious character. They provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens. To say that the State cannot prescribe Sunday as a day of rest for these purposes solely because centuries ago such laws had their genesis in religion would give a constitutional interpretation of hostility to the public welfare rather than one of mere separation of church and state. Constitutional textThe relevant clauses of the 1st and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution: The 1st Amendment   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.   Section 1 of the 14th Amendment   All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.   The court's decisionThe Court held that Maryland's laws did not violate the First Amendment. The plaintiffs claimed only economic injury, not that they had been prevented from the free exercise of their religion. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Warren concluded:  [The] appellants allege only economic injury to themselves; they do not allege any infringement of their own religious freedoms due to Sunday closing. In fact, the record is silent as to what appellants' religious beliefs are. Since the general rule is that "a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities," (United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 22) we hold that appellants have no standing to raise this contention.  The Court also held that the law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren again:  ...the Court has [previously] held that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power [even when], in practice, their laws result in some inequality.  In reaching their conclusion, the Court also examined the wider question of whether laws proscribing or limiting Sunday trading were constitutional. They held that such laws did not violate the division between church and state, because - no matter the historical roots of such laws - the laws existed as constituted in order to fulfill a secular objective. In other words, even if Sunday trading laws were originally intended to facilitate and encourage church attendance in the colonial United States, the laws as presently constituted were intended to improve the "health, safety, recreation, and general well-being" of citizens. The present purpose of the laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all; the fact that this day is of particular significance for one or more religions does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals in this manner.

The Maryland Zoo  The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore  — formerly The Baltimore Zoo — is located in Druid Hill Park in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.  Home to over 2,000 animals, it is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).  HistoryThe Maryland Zoo in Baltimore is generally considered to be the third oldest zoological park in the United States, having opened in 1876. In 2004, the zoo was struck by financial problems and was forced to reduce its collection size by closing parts of the zoo.   The Main Valley was closed due to its age, being incapable of holding animals comfortably, and the Reptile House was closed.  The reptiles, as well as gibbons and snow leopards were sent on loan to other zoos and aquariums. In 2008, the zoo was featured in America's Best Zoos 2008.Maryland Zoo in Baltimore is active in many conservation programs, notably the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Program and Project Golden Frog; it is the zoo that breeds the greatest number of African black footed penguins.  It also helps rehabilitate local wildlife, especially birds of prey such as bald eagles. Exhibits African JourneyThe largest area of the zoo, the African journey displays a wide range of animals originating from Africa.Such exhibits include:  Lappet-faced Vulture, Cranes (Black Crowned and Demoiselle), White Stork, Ground Hornbill and Sitatunga African Crested Porcupine African Watering Hole: Dama Gazelle, Saddle-billed Stork, Helmeted Guineafowl, White Rhinoceros, Plains Zebra, and Ostrich Spur-thighed Tortoise African Aviary Leopard Cheetah Warthog Kirk's Dik-dik Vulturine Guineafowl Chimpanzee Forest: Chimpanzee, Colobus Monkey, Rock Hyrax, Coquerel's Sifaka, and Slender-snouted Crocodile. Red Ruffed Lemur Lion Giraffe House & Okapi Rock Island: African Black-footed Penguin, Cormorant African Elephant Camel rides   The zoo features a feeding station where guests may interact with the zoo's three Reticulated Giraffes by feeding them for a small fee.   Renovations on the elephant facility began 2007.    In March 2006, the Maryland Zoo announced  it would be accepting three female African elephants from the Philadelphia Zoo as part of the expanded elephant exhibit, but construction was then delayed and the elephant loan was canceled.  However, two new elephants came to the Maryland Zoo from Arkansas in 2007.  On March 19, 2008, Felix, one of the zoo's female elephants, gave birth to a 290-pound male calf, the first elephant born in the zoo's history. The baby is named Samson and is now viewable, weather permitting.In the spring of 2010, the zoo's warthogs had two male offspring, which were viewable beginning in May of that year.  Maryland Wilderness featuring The Children's ZooDisplaying animals found in Maryland, visitors can watch otters swim over their heads, jump across lily pads, explore a cave, or climb into giant bird nests.  The Bog: features the Bog Turtle, an endangered species. Marsh Aviary & Lily Pads: surrounds a man-made stream featuring many species of ducks and other Maryland birds. The Stream: includes river otters and red fox.  You can visit a submerged archway, and watch as otters swim overhead. The Cave: a beautifully sculpted life-size model of a cave, featuring more than a dozen small exhibits including snakes, bats, and newts. Giant Tree & Slide: features many native reptiles and amphibians animals, mainly snakes.  The slide is a fun way for kids to get back to the ground. Meadow: has animals such as box turtles and American toads.  Kids can poke their heads in large bubble-like windows coming out of the ground. The Farmyard: features a variety of rare domestic breeds that can be touched; the highlight is a petting area of friendly African pygmy goats and Nubian goats called "The Kid Zone" because young goats are called kids and it also attracts children.  Other animals included in the section include Jacob Sheep, Donkey, Barn Owl, Chicken, Geese, Pig, and Dexter Cattle.   The Maryland Wilderness featuring The Children's Zoo is dedicated to Lyn P. Meyerhoff.A zoo train operated as recently as 2005, with a replacement train under construction as of early 2010.     Polar Bear WatchThe Polar Bear Watch features polar bears named Magnet and Anoki, as well as Ravens and Arctic Foxes.  Guests can view bears from underwater viewing areas, or from the windows of an actual massive Tundra Buggy, purchased from the Canadian company that creates these one of kind vehicles for viewing Polar Bears in their natural habitat. Magnet won a contest put forth by Microsoft's Zoo Tycoon for best zoo animal. Magnet was available as a downloadable patch for the game and during the game, polar bears purchased via the Magnet icon would play with a red ball.  Base Camp DiscoveryBase Camp Discovery is located between the Polar Bear Watch and the African Journey.  There, educational activities and various animal ambassadors are presented by zoo educators.  Animals that are often shown at Base Camp Discovery include the Boa Constrictor, Egyptian Tortoise, Painted Turtle, Box Turtle, Diamondback Terrapin, Corn Snake, Blue and Gold Macaw, African Gray Parrot, Indian Runner Duck, and Eastern Screech Owl, among many others.

Although the swim team does not compete within a conference, it participates in the yearly Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) swim championships. The 2009 season was the first season the Notre Dame softball team competed in NCAA Division III. The 2009-2010 academic year also saw the college's basketball season come to an abrupt end due to "injuries" after the first game of the season.  The team returned to the court in 2010-2011 and recorded a 3-22 overall record and a 0-16 CSAC mark.  The college has invested in two full-time staff members (Athletic Director, Assistant Athletic Director) within the Athletic Department, while all of its coaching staff are part-time, mainly seasonal employees. Although two coaches at the College have been coaching at the school for over 20 years, head coaching turnover has been constant over the past few seasons. The mascot of the College of Notre Dame Athletic Department is the "Gator." A new, up-to-date Gator logo was unveiled in May 2010.

Southern Maryland Southern Maryland in popular usage is composed of the state's southernmost counties on the "Western Shore" of the Chesapeake Bay.  This region includes all of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary's counties and sometimes the southern portions of Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties. HistorySouthern Maryland was originally inhabited by Piscataway Indians. Captain John Smith explored the area in 1608 and 1609.    He explored the lower Chesapeake Bay in 1607.  In 1634 St. Mary's City, at southern Maryland's lower tip was the site of the first Roman Catholic English settlement in North America (the site is now a living history museum). Tobacco plantations flourished in southern Maryland during slavery.With a slave economy during the American Civil War, regional white sympathies were very pro-Confederate (as evidenced in the official state song lyrics). From the war's beginning, however, large numbers of Union occupying troops and patrolling river gunboats prevented the state's secession, although nighttime smuggling across the Potomac River with Virginia took place. John Wilkes Booth was helped by local people in his escape through the area after killing President Abraham Lincoln.Southern Maryland was traditionally a rural and agricultural region, linked by passenger and freight steamboat routes. These steamboat routes operated on the Chesapeake Bay and major rivers until the 1930s before the building of highways and the Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge on U.S. Highway 301.  Weekend excursion boats also carried Washingtonians to small amusement parks and amusement pavilions at numerous shore locations. From 1949 (1943 in some places) to 1968, the region was popular for its slot machine gambling. Population and economics During recent times, the region experienced suburban development as the Washington suburbs expanded southward.  This expansion took place primarily in Prince George's County, and around Waldorf (a regional shopping hub) and St. Charles (a planned community in Charles County), Lexington Park (St. Mary's County) and Prince Frederick (Calvert County). This expansion of the Washington DC metropolitan area has caused much of southern Maryland's formerly predominant southern culture to fade giving way to a rapidly growing northeastern culture that is found throughout much of the Northeast Megalopolis.   However, as noted, land-use maps show that the area is still primarily low-density. Many southern Marylanders work at Andrews Air Force Base, the U.S. Census Bureau or at Patuxent River Naval Air Station and its related industries.  Other smaller industries include a nuclear power plant  and a liquified natural gas terminal  (both in Lusby), a Naval ordnance test ground (at Indian Head),  electric power plants (at Aquasco and Morgantown)  and an oil terminal  (at Piney Point).  The beautiful towns of Solomons Island and Chesapeake Beach are favorite weekend tourist resorts.  Maryland International Raceway and Budds Creek Raceway near Chaptico attract many auto and motocross racing enthusiasts.While the steamboats are long gone, more than three-quarters of the land area is still rural, a mixture of forest and farmland.   The growing of tobacco, once a dominant crop, has declined greatly because of state government farm buyouts during the 1990s.St. Mary's County is home to Amish and Mennonite communities. In addition, two state recognized tribes exist Piscataway Native American tribe, tribes that live along the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay in southern Maryland (see We-Sorts).  Fishing, boating and crabbing are popular activities in this region; large marinas are found in the Solomons Island and North Beach areas.  However, the population of fish and other marine life is threatened by pollution and environmental factors.  Ancient marine fossils are abundant at Calvert Cliffs. GeographyThe region's northern boundary passes through Prince George's County and Anne Arundel County, east of Washington.  Its eastern boundary is the Chesapeake Bay and its southern and western boundary is the Potomac River, Maryland's boundary with Virginia. Food and cuisine  Perhaps the most notable food dish originating from Southern Maryland is stuffed ham, which is cabbage, kale, onions, spices and seasonings that are chopped and mixed, then stuffed  into deep slits slashed in a whole, corned ham. Seafood is popular amongst Southern Marylanders, given the region's location along the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Both steamed crabs and crab cakes are considered Southern Maryland delicacies due to the large amount of harvesting of blue crabs from the bay. Also popular are oysters, which were once fished from the bay in great numbers, and served either fried, raw or stuffed.

Populist Party of Maryland    The Populist Party of Maryland (PPMD) originated as a vehicle for ballot access for the 2004 Ralph Nader presidential campaign. Unlike such groups in other states, the PPMD organization has survived beyond 2004, laboring to field candidates for local political offices. In 2006, Populists launched a campaign for governor of Maryland, nominating Chris Driscoll, their state chairman, and only member, as their candidate. Driscoll chose Ed Rothstein, a Baltimore labor organizer as his running mate. The Populist candidates emphasize the Populist alternative to Liberalism and Conservativism, tax cuts for working people through the Tobin tax, a "split-rate" land value tax, employee- or consumer-owned electric companies and municipal utilities (banned by Maryland state law since the late 1990s under energy reforms enacted by the Democratic General Assembly), and promoting government promotion of employee ownership and control of workplaces through Employee Stock Ownership Plans. Origin The Ralph Nader campaign chose to create a local "Populist Party" in states where ballot access is more readily available by forming a new political party than by filing as an independent candidate.These "Populist Parties" are inspired by 1890s American political party of that name and have no connection to the late-twentieth century Populist Party, which ran candidates such as David Duke and Bo Gritz and was widely regarded as a racist, white supremacist organization.In Maryland, the Populist Party only succeeded in putting Nader on the ballot after challenges from the Maryland Board of Elections and the local Democratic Party.  The PPMD submitted a petition of nearly 15,000 signatures on August 2, a number more than sufficient to achieve official party status and a ballot line, but this was rejected under a local ballot access law as a number of the signees had moved between counties since their voter registration.  On September 20, the Maryland Court of Appeals found the restricting law unconstitutional and ordered the Board of Elections to accept the petition for Nader and Camejo. ContinuationThe party conceived a "Unity Campaign" with the idea of bringing together Green Party, Libertarian Party, and Populist voters in support of the fusion ticket of U.S. Senate candidate Kevin Zeese, a founder of the PPMD and 2004 press secretary for Ralph Nader.According to Chris Driscoll, the state party chairman, the party plans to run candidates for municipal, county, state and federal seats, under the slogan "Democracy and a Better Paycheck Too."  The Populist Party of Maryland's rank and file and leaders have drafted a program calling for an end to the "corporate crime wave," cleaning up widespread political corruption in the capital city of Annapolis, and enacting legislation favorable to employees, employee-owned businesses and small business owners, small landlords, etc.In August of 2008, the Populist party was reconstituted as the Independent Party. Its membership soared from 5 to 35,000 at one point in May 2010, after all independent voters were counted as members of the new party, blurring the distinction between 'independent' and 'Independent'. However, the Independent Party of Maryland was dissolved by the State Board of Elections on June 3, 2010 due to its inactive campaign finance account.

Constitution of Maryland   The current Constitution of the State of Maryland, which was ratified by the people of the state on September 18, 1867, forms the basic law for the U.S. state of Maryland.  It replaced the short-lived Maryland Constitution of 1864 and is the fourth constitution under which the state has been governed.  It was last amended in 2012. At approximately 47,000 words (including annotations), the Maryland Constitution is much longer than the average length of a state constitution in the United States, which is about 26,000 words (the United States Constitution is about 8,700 words long). Background, drafting, and ratificationThe state's  1864 constitution, written during the Civil War, while the Unionists temporarily controlled Maryland, proved to be unsuitable in a state that still had Southern sympathies.  That document, which was approved by a bare majority (50.31%) of the state's eligible voters, was designed to disenfranchise the approximately 25,000 Marylanders who fought for the Confederacy or in other ways supported it.  Also, while emancipating the state's slaves, the 1864 constitution changed the basis of representation in the General Assembly to help keep power in the hands of the white elite.The Constitution of 1867 was drafted by a convention which met at the state capital, Annapolis, between May 8 and August 17, 1867.  It was submitted to the people of the state for ratification on September 18 and was approved by a vote of 27,152 to 23,036.  It took effect on October 5, 1867.  Declaration of RightsThe Maryland Constitution begins with a Declaration of Rights, which is similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights but, like most state bills of rights, is broader than the federal version.  Among other things, the Maryland Constitution guarantees trial by jury, due process, freedom of the press and of religion.  It also forbids, among other things, the passage of ex post facto laws and cruel and unusual punishment.  Notably, juries in criminal cases are declared to be judges of law as well as fact, thus ensconcing in the constitution the right of (what is commonly called) jury nullification—commonplace in the early 19th century, but by 1867 already in decline as a result of abuse (in such conflicts as the Mormons in Nauvoo and the Fugitive Slave Law), and today very much the minority position.While the Declaration of Rights does say that "a well regulated Militia is the proper and natural defence of a free Government," it does not guarantee a right to bear arms.  This makes the Maryland Constitution one of the very few state constitutions that lacks the equivalent of the federal Second Amendment.  There is also a rather striking effort to limit the guarantee against religious disabilities to those who believe in God and divine rewards and punishments.  Article 36 includes the wording   "nor shall any person, otherwise competent, be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his religious belief; provided, he believes in the existence of God, and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come."   A unanimous 1961 decision by US Supreme court in the case of Torcaso v. Watkins found that an attempt to enforce this provision violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  In 1970, this article was amended to include the sentence "Nothing in this article shall constitute an establishment of religion".  However the original wording of the article was also left in place, but presumably is symbolic rather than effective.Maryland's Constitution also makes explicit the separation of powers doctrine which is only implied in the federal constitution.  The Maryland Constitution clearly states that "the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other." Amendments  Amendment processAmendments to the constitution are proposed by the state legislature with a three-fifths vote in both chambers.  Amendments must then be ratified by a simple majority of the people voting on the question in a referendum held simultaneously with the next general election.  Unlike the federal constitution, when the Maryland Constitution is amended the official text of the document is edited, removing language that is no longer in force.  However, most printed versions of the constitution include annotations which indicate which portions were amended or removed and at what times.  A provision in the document requires that every 20 years the people of the state be asked if a state constitutional convention should be convened.  Such a convention is called if a majority of the voters request it.  At the latest election where this question could be asked in 2010, the voters did not choose to call a convention. Notable amendmentsWhile the average state constitution has been amended approximately 115 times,  , the Maryland Constitution has been amended almost 200 times, most recently in 2008.   In 1972 an amendment created the current legislative districting system that the state's General Assembly follows and in 1970 an amendment that created the position of Lieutenant Governor of Maryland was approved.In 1910 the Digges Amendment, which would have used property requirements to effectively disenfranchise many African Americans, was proposed.  However, it was rejected by the people at the general election. 2008 AmendmentsTwo amendments were on the 2008 Maryland State Ballot   Question 1 was for an amendment to allow early voting. Question 2 was for an amendment to issue licenses for video lottery terminals (Slot Machines). The opponents of question 1 contended that early voting would lead to voter fraud, since Maryland is one of the few states that does not require identification to either register to vote or to vote.  A campaign against Question 2 ran television commercials in the days before Election Day telling viewers to vote "No" on Question 2.  This amendment was the latest step in a long battle over whether to have slot machines in the State of Maryland and, if so, where they should be located and how the revenue should be allocated. Both amendments were approved, with 72.1% of Maryland voters who voted on the proposed amendments voting "Yes" on Question 1, and 58.7% voting "Yes" on the more controversial Question 2     also  Government of Maryland History of Maryland Maryland Constitution of 1864 Maryland Constitution of 1851 Maryland Constitution of 1776   References     Whitman H.

Maryland Constitution of 1867 
Maryland Constitution of 1776   The Maryland Constitution of 1776 was the first of four constitutions under which the U.S. state of Maryland has been governed.  It was that state's basic law from its adoption in 1776 until the Maryland Constitution of 1851 took effect on July 4th of that year. Background and draftingThe eighth session decided that the continuation of an ad-hoc government by the convention was not a good mechanism for governing the state and that a more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776 they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first state constitution, one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government "...of the people only." On August 1, all freemen with property elected delegates for the Maryland Constitutional Convention of 1776. They began meeting on August 14, drafted the constitution, and adjourned on November 11th. The document was not submitted to the people for ratification.  The Assembly of Freemen would not meet again, as it was replaced by the new state government established by the 1776 constitution. Thomas Johnson became the state's first elected governor. Declaration of RightsThe document included a Declaration of Rights.  This, among other things, ended the position of the Church of England as the state-supported religion, and granted all Christians, including Roman Catholics, freedom of worship. Free blacks who met the property qualifications continued to be eligible to vote.  The declaration was more than a bill of rights, which enunciates certain rights which are reserved to the people.  The declaration stated that all power emanated from the people and that the governors were accountable to the people. Elections and the franchiseDespite the declaration that all power emanates from the people, the document kept political power in the hands of the elites. Only males citizens who met a minimum property requirement could vote.  Slaves and women could not vote, nor did they have equal rights to men. Only Christians could hold office until 1826, when legislation was adopted allowing Jews to hold office and have equal rights and privileges with Christians.They directly elected delegates to the Maryland General Assembly and indirectly elected State Senators.  Voters would elect Senatorial Electors every five years.  These men would then meet together to elect a fifteen member Senate, nine members from the Western Shore and six members from the Eastern Shore. If a Senate vacancy occurred between elections, then the Senate itself selected a replacement. The Governor was elected by the joint legislature, not by the people directly.  And most local offices were appointed by the Governor, with the concurrence of his Executive Council. Subsequent historyThe 1776 constitution was amended several times, most notably in 1837, to, among other things, provide for a popularly elected governor, instead of one chosen by the legislature.  The constitution was initially about 8,800 words long.  The several amendments added to it between 1792 and 1846 brought its total length to about 15,200 words.

Interstate 695 (Maryland)   Interstate 695 (abbreviated I-695) is a  -long full beltway Interstate Highway extending around Baltimore, Maryland, USA. I-695 is officially designated the McKeldin Beltway, but is colloquially referred to as either the Baltimore Beltway or 695. The route is an auxiliary route of Interstate 95, intersecting that route southwest of Baltimore near Arbutus and northeast of the city near White Marsh. It also intersects other major roads radiating from the Baltimore area, including Interstate 97 near Glen Burnie, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (Maryland Route 295) near Linthicum, Interstate 70 near Woodlawn, Interstate 795 near Pikesville, and Interstate 83 in the Timonium area. The   portion of the Baltimore Beltway between I-95 northeast of Baltimore and I-97 south of Baltimore is officially Maryland Route 695, and is not part of the Interstate Highway System, but is signed as I-695. This section of the route includes the Francis Scott Key Bridge that crosses over the Patapsco River. The bridge and its approaches are maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority while the remainder of the Baltimore Beltway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration.The Baltimore Beltway was first planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state eventually took over the project and it became part of the Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from Maryland Route 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today Maryland Route 702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote The Star-Spangled Banner, and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD 695. There are future plans for I-695 that include express toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 is currently being reconstructed to accommodate express toll lanes that are to be added to I-95. Route description Curtis Creek to I-95Starting at the zero milepost in Baltimore, I-695, which at this point is officially called MD 695 and is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority, is four lanes wide.  The route passes over Curtis Creek on a pair of drawbridges here, which have   of vertical navigational clearance and provide access for tall ships to a U.S. Coast Guard base further upstream.     Continuing west through industrial areas into Anne Arundel County, the route encounters the northern terminus of Maryland Route 10 (Arundel Expressway) at a directional interchange, where maintenance switches to the Maryland State Highway Administration. The interchange includes access to the next interchange, with Maryland Route 2 (Ritchie Highway), a major north–south route between Baltimore and the southern suburbs, in Glen Burnie. This interchange has access to northbound MD 2 in both directions and from northbound MD 2 to the westbound direction. Beyond MD 2, I-695 encounters Interstate 895 Spur, a short connector to Interstate 895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway); this interchange provides access to southbound MD 2 from both directions and to the eastbound direction from southbound MD 2.    Immediately past this interchange, I-695 comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of Interstate 97, which terminates on the Beltway. At this point, the route officially becomes I-695. The route continues west as a six-lane   freeway, heading west into residential areas of  Linthicum.    It interchanges with Maryland Route 648 (Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard), where 132,330 vehicles travel I-695 every day, before turning northwest and intersecting Maryland Route 170 (Camp Meade Road).  The route encounters the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (Maryland Route 295) at a cloverleaf interchange where the route’s signage changes from east–west to north–south at this interchange.      It turns more to the north from here and heads into commercial areas, interchanging with Maryland Route 168 (Nursery Road) and Hammonds Ferry Road.    Past this interchange, the route crosses the Patapsco River into Baltimore County and soon encounters a partial interchange with Interstate 895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) with access only from the southbound direction of I-695 to I-895 northbound and from I-895 southbound to the northbound direction of I-695.   Past this interchange, I-695 heads north, interchanging with Hollins Ferry Road in Lansdowne before passing under CSX’s Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and coming to an interchange with U.S. Route 1 Alternate (Washington Boulevard) in Arbutus.   A short distance later, I-695 comes to a semidirectional interchange with  Interstate 95.   I-95 to I-70I-695 widens to nine lanes past interchange with I-95, with five lanes in the southbound direction and four lanes in the northbound direction. Running northwest, it crosses over Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor and comes to a partial interchange with U.S. Route 1 (Southwestern Boulevard), with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. From here, it continues northwest through residential areas of Catonsville to an interchange with Maryland Route 372 (Wilkens Avenue). Narrowing to eight lanes total, with four lanes in each direction, beyond MD 372, the route continues through suburban neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with Maryland Route 144 (Frederick Road). At this point, I-695 narrows to seven lanes, with three southbound lanes and four northbound lanes. It continues north and interchanges with Edmondson Avenue before turning northwest and intersects U.S. Route 40 (Baltimore National Pike) near the defunct Westview Mall, now a big-box complex.   Beyond US 40, I-695 continues north through residential areas, narrowing to six lanes, with three lanes in each direction, before coming to a four-level stack interchange with Interstate 70 in Woodlawn.   I-70 to I-83The Baltimore Beltway narrows from seven to six lanes within the interchange, which contains braided ramps providing access to the next interchange, Maryland Route 122 (Security Boulevard), located near the Security Square Mall and the headquarters of the Social Security Administration.   Continuing north, the road widens to eight lanes again and continues through a mix of suburban homes and business parks in Lochearn. I-695 interchanges with Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) east of Randallstown and resumes north, narrowing to six lanes. It intersects the southern terminus of Interstate 795 (Northwest Expressway), which serves as a bypass of Maryland Route 140 in the Owings Mills area.   The Baltimore Metro's line to Owings Mills passes under I-695 within the interchange and runs in the median of I-795 as far as that town.  At the I-795 interchange, the signage of route changes from north–south to east–west.    From here, I-695 heads northeast as an eight lane road and enters Pikesville, where it intersects MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at a single-point urban interchange.   A short distance later, the road comes to a partial interchange with Maryland Route 129 (Park Heights Avenue), with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. I-695 heads east to another partial interchange with Stevenson Road, which has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance.  The Baltimore Beltway passes through heavily forested land as it encounters Greenspring Avenue.   Past this interchange, I-695 continues northeast through woodland before coming to an interchange with Interstate 83 (Jones Falls Expressway). The interchange includes connections to Maryland Route 25 (Falls Road), which heads into the open countryside north of Baltimore. Within this interchange, I-83 forms a concurrency with I-695 and the roadway widens to ten lanes, with six for the Beltway and four for I-83.  After running concurrently, I-83 splits from I-695 by heading north on the Harrisburg Expressway at a directional interchange.  I-83 to I-95 Beyond I-83, I-695 turns northeast as a six lane road and heads into Towson, interchanging with Maryland Route 139 (Charles Street).   The Baltimore Beltway heads through residential and commercial areas before coming to interchanges with Maryland Route 45 (York Road) near The Shops at Kenilworth and Maryland Route 146 (Dulaney Valley Road).  Continuing east, the Baltimore Beltway passes to the north of Goucher College and comes to an interchange with Providence Road.   I-695 turns southeast through residential areas past Providence Road and comes to an interchange with Maryland Route 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard) and Cromwell Bridge Road.  The road continues towards Parkville, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Maryland Route 41 (Perring Parkway) within commercial areas.  The Baltimore Beltway continues through residential areas into Carney, coming to another cloverleaf interchange with Maryland Route 147 (Harford Road).   Continuing east into White Marsh, the route encounters the western terminus of Maryland Route 43 (White Marsh Boulevard), a limited-access at-grade boulevard that provides access to White Marsh Mall, US 1 and I-95. I-695 turns south past MD 43 and interchanges with US 1 (Belair Road) south of White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) a short distance after US 1 in Rossville.   This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; at the site of each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers.  In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).    I-95 to Curtis CreekContinuing south, the Baltimore Beltway officially becomes MD 695 again, despite being signed as I-695, and soon encounters Maryland Route 7 (Philadelphia Road).   Between I-95 and MD 7, the route’s changes from east–west to north–south.       Immediately after MD 7, the route interchanges with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) northwest of Essex near The Centre at Golden Ring.   After US 40, I-695 crosses over CSX’s Philadelphia Subdivision and comes to a partial directional interchange with Maryland Route 702 (Southeast Boulevard). At this interchange, I-695 turns south onto the Windlass Freeway, crossing over the Northeast Corridor again within the interchange.  Running south along the Windlass Freeway, parallel to the Northeast Corridor, I-695, now narrowed to four lanes, turns west before making a sharp turn to the south, crossing over the railroad line twice.  The road becomes the Patapsco Freeway and continues south to an interchange with Maryland Route 150 (Eastern Avenue) and Maryland Route 157 (Merritt Boulevard) near the Eastpoint Mall. A short distance later, I-695 comes to an interchange with Maryland Route 151 (North Point Boulevard).   From here, the route continues southeast along the Back River into residential and industrial Dundalk, interchanging with Cove Road.  The route turns south, with the median briefly widening to include trees, before coming to another interchange with MD 151. Past MD 151, the Baltimore Beltway continues southwest through industrial areas, with maintenance switching to the Maryland Transportation Authority at the crossing of a CSX rail line. It comes to an interchange with MD 157 (Peninsula Expressway) and Maryland Route 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard) before heading west. The route runs past the Sparrows Point Industrial Complex before crossing over Bear Creek and interchanging with unsigned Maryland Route 695A (Broening Highway) south of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance.  Beyond this interchange, the route comes to two-way toll plaza and has a U-turn ramp from the southbound direction to the northbound direction intended to provide southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A by way of Authority Drive. After this, the route ascends onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River.   Unlike the Fort McHenry or Harbor Tunnels, HAZMAT trucks are allowed to cross the Key Bridge.    After crossing the Patapsco River over the bridge the route touches down within the Baltimore city limits and continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point's industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road, which provides access to Maryland Route 173, south of Curtis Bay.  By this point, the route’s signage changes from north–south to east–west.       Past this interchange, the Baltimore Beltway continues west and returns to the Curtis Creek drawbridges.  Exit numberingAs opposed to Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway) around Washington, D.C., on which exit numbers are generally arranged by mileposts counterclockwise starting at the southern crossing of the Potomac River, the exit numbers for the Baltimore Beltway are arranged consecutively clockwise starting at Interchange #1 at Quarantine Rd, west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge crossing of the Patapsco River.  HistoryThe Baltimore County Planning Commission first conceived the Baltimore Beltway as a county-level roadway project in 1949; by 1953 the project was taken over by the state due to slow progress at the county level. The project was included as part of the Interstate Highway System by 1956, increasing the speed of construction due to federal funds available. The first part of the Baltimore Beltway to be completed was in December 1955 between MD 25 (Falls Road) and the Harrisburg Expressway (present-day I-83). In 1956, the next portion of the road between the Harrisburg Expressway and MD 45 (York Road) opened. Several more segments of the Baltimore Beltway would be built in the following years, with the section from MD 168 (Nursery Road) to the Glen Burnie Bypass (present-day I-97) opening in 1957; the portions from MD 45 to MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard), MD 7 (Old Philadelphia Road) to US 40 (Pulaski Highway), and from MD 168 to US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) opening in 1958; the segment from MD 2 (Ritchie Highway) to the Glen Burnie Bypass completed in 1960; the portion from US 1 (Belair Road) to MD 7 finished in 1961; and the portions from MD 542 to US 1 and from US 40 to MD 25 finished in 1962.    At this time, the original length of the Baltimore Beltway, from MD 2 in the south clockwise to US 40 in the northeast, was fully completed and opened to traffic, providing the first Interstate-grade bypass of Baltimore and the first beltway in the United States built under the Interstate Highway System.   A segment of the road completed in 1973 ran from MD 10 to MD 2, heading toward the Outer Harbor Crossing.  Windlass and Patapsco freewaysAt the northeastern terminus, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend southeast along the Back River Neck peninsula and turn south to cross the river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast Freeway (designated MD 702) by 1975.     However, the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned to be part of it. The first was the Windlass Freeway (Maryland Route 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south.  The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco Freeway, a short connector from the Windlass Freeway southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Only the segment of the Windlass Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 (North Point Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973. Ramp stubs for the planned Windlass Freeway are present at the proposed west end at I-95 and Moravia Road,  and at the present east end at the Southeast Freeway.  American Automobile Association, Baltimore Triptik insert, 1976 (shows the proposed extensions at each end)  The junction of the Windlass and Patapsco Freeways was originally built with provisions for extensions of each,  but this has since been reconstructed.  Outer Harbor CrossingThe Outer Harbor Crossing is the name given to the segment of the Baltimore Beltway that is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority.  It consists of the segment of I-695 between Exit 40 (MD 151) and Exit 2 (MD 10), which includes the Francis Scott Key Bridge.    The route was originally planned as a two-lane freeway on a four-lane right-of-way, with a two-lane outer harbor tunnel across the Patapsco River. When the tunnel was advertised for construction in 1970, the bids were so high that the decision was made to construct a four-lane bridge instead.  The bridge was to feature two-lane approach roads on both sides.   Construction on the Outer Harbor Crossing, including the bridge, started in 1972 and was completed on March 23, 1977, completing the full Baltimore Beltway.  The bridge was named the Francis Scott Key Bridge in honor of Francis Scott Key, who wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner," the national anthem of the United States.    By the early 1980s, the southern approach to the Key Bridge was dualized, with a second roadway constructed along with a second drawbridge over Curtis Creek.    The northern approach was left as a two-lane viaduct in the Sparrows Point area until a four-lane surface freeway was constructed along this portion, with interchanges reconfigured, following an $89.5 million project completed in January 2000.    The Outer Harbor Crossing, as well as the entire Baltimore Beltway east of I-95, was first signposted as MD 695 because portions of it were a two-lane expressway not up to Interstate Highway standards.  Improvements to the road have allowed the entire Baltimore Beltway to be signed as I-695, even though all of I-695 between the junction of I-95 northeast of Baltimore and I-97 is officially considered MD 695 by the MDSHA.    1999 footbridge collapseOn June 8, 1999, a tractor-trailer carrying a backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just northwest of the Interstate 95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.    McKeldin BeltwayThe Beltway was dedicated in honor of former Governor Theodore R. McKeldin in May 2005. McKeldin was responsible for the construction of the Beltway and other state highways during his term.     Most Marylanders still refer to the highway as the "Baltimore Beltway," "695," or (mostly among Baltimore metro area residents) simply "The Beltway," like its Washington counterpart.        FutureIn March 2009, construction began on the reconstruction of the bridge that carries MD 139 (Charles Street) over I-695.    The bridge will be decorative, featuring ornamental street lights. As part of the MD 139 project, the interchange will be reconstructed and the traffic circle at the MD 139/I-695 ramps will be removed and replaced with a traffic signal.    This project is expected to cost $50 million and be completed in 2012.  At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both highways cross over themselves so that all through traffic is on the left side of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009.     The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009.  In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the express toll lanes being added to I-95.   There are long-term plans to add express toll lanes to I-695 to ease traffic congestion along the route.    In addition, there are also plans to widen the portion of I-695 between I-83 and I-95 to the north of Baltimore. This road, which is to be widened to eight lanes, is currently in the design phase.    Exit listExits are numbered sequentially (unlike other interstates in Maryland which use a milepost-based system), and in a clockwise (inner loop) direction, in accordance with AASHTO guidelines.                                                                                                                      Auxiliary routes  MD 695A runs along Broening Highway, a two-lane undivided road that begins at I-695 exit 44 and heads northwest through residential and industrial areas in Dundalk, Baltimore County to the Baltimore city line. The route provides access to the Dundalk Marine Terminal from I-695. MD 695A is   long.     MD 695B runs along Belclare Road from MD 695A north to Dundalk Avenue in Dundalk, Baltimore County. The route is   long.     MD 695C runs along Authority Drive from MD 695A southwest to I-695 in Dundalk, Baltimore County, looping under the route at the Francis Scott Key Bridge to merge onto northbound I-695. MD 695C serves as part of a U-turn ramp to provide access to MD 695A from southbound I-695 and to provide access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A. The route is   long.

Maryland Conservation Council The Maryland Conservation Council (MCC) is a coalition of environmental organizations that has been active since the early 1970s. MCC aims to protect the environment in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with special attention to Maryland. During the Maryland General Assembly legislative session (January through April each year), MCC publishes a weekly legislative update, Conservation Reports. One of MCC's earliest projects involved the protection of Cove Point in Calvert County, Maryland, which resulted in the formation of Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust.The MCC's Goals are to protect  Scenic wild rivers and Appalachian hardwood forests in the Allegheny Plateau of Western Maryland;  Sandy beaches on the barrier islands of the Atlantic Ocean with productive yet fragile bays behind them;  Cypress swamps along an ancient black water river and vast wetlands providing winter habitat for migrating waterfowl on the Coastal Plain of the Eastern Shore;  Geologically significant features and species rich forests and rivers in the Piedmont;  The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries which once produced vast quantities of aquatic resources.  Conservationists today are faced with a serious dilemma.  They are certain that the use of fossil fuels is leading toward a global catastrophe.  But at the same time they are increasingly aware that many types of renewable energy, because of the large amount of land that they require, will have a seriously detrimental impact on the natural world, especially if their use expands.The MCC has concluded that nuclear energy, which produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, (1) also has a smaller footprint or impact on biological diversity compared to wind, solar, or biomass; in some cases, orders of magnitude smaller.  When cost is stripped of various forms of governmental assistance, and the actual, not theoretical, effectiveness is used to calculate the size of the installation needed to generate a given amount of electricity, nuclear power is the least expensive.The MCC has also concluded that commercial reactors of the type now used in the United States have a sound safety record, even considering the accident at Three Mile Island (TMI), and that there is no credible evidence that there has been harm to health by these reactors. MCC further concluded that the hazards of transporting used nuclear fuel have been badly exaggerated, and that recent proposals about the storage of used fuel will reduce the technological difficulty of construction a long-term repository.The MCC's Board voted at its November 2007 meeting to support Constellation Energy Group’s proposal to build a third nuclear reactor at its Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Charles County.

Maryland Route 201   Maryland Route 201 is a   suburban road near Washington, DC. Route descriptionMD 201 begins at a large hybrid cloverleaf just outside the D.C. boundary at Tuxedo, Maryland that is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration. Two routes converge at the northern and western ends of the interchange: US 50, which follows the first   of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway from the DC line, and the B-W Parkway itself, which splits in the northern quadrant of the interchange into two connectors; one connector leads to and from US 50, while the other connects to MD 201. Within the interchange, the B-W Parkway proper splits from US 50, which interchanges with MD 201 before continuing east as the John Hanson Highway. MD 201, after interchanging with US 50, itself splits from the Kenilworth Avenue Freeway, and the remaining segment of this freeway merges with the B-W Parkway at a wye junction within the interchange.From the Tuxedo interchange, MD 201 continues along Kenilworth Avenue and later Edmonston Avenue, surface streets, and travels north across the Capital Beltway to end at MD 212 in Beltsville (although Edmonston Avenue continues northward into the Muirkirk and South Laurel area).The route travels through the western edge of Greenbelt Park and meets MD 193 Greenbelt Road at a grade-separated interchange in the northwestern corner of the park. The route also travels close to College Park Airport.   Junction list                              See also      References  External links   MDRoads: MD 201   
Interstate 295 (Maryland–District of Columbia)  Interstate 295 (I-295) in the U.S. state of Maryland and in Washington, D.C. is a   spur route connecting I-95 / I-495 and Maryland Route 210 (Indian Head Highway) near the Potomac River (just outside the District's boundary with Maryland) to Interstate 695 & D.C. Route 295 in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, DC. Route description Although I-295 technically begins at the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495), a pair of mainline ramps connects the southern terminus of the route to the nearby MD 210. Continuing north from this interchange, I-295 enters the District of Columbia; the route is only   long in Maryland. The highway is known throughout as the Anacostia Freeway.Passing to the west and north of Oxon Cove Park, the route parallels the Potomac River, running through the Southeast quadrant of D.C. It passes close to Shepard Parkway and forms the eastern boundary of Bolling Air Force Base and the Anacostia Naval Station. Near the southern end of Anacostia Park the route turns east and begins to parallel the Anacostia River, interchanging with South Capitol Street near the latter's crossing of the river.Within the park, I-295 encounters the junction with I-695 (which heads northwest across the 11th Street Bridges) and D.C. Route 295 at Exit 4.  At this junction I-295 ends and the mainline freeway through the interchange assumes the identity of D.C. Route 295 and continues to Baltimore, though it changes identities several times: DC 295, MD 201, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (an unnumbered federally owned expressway operated by the National Park Service), and MD 295.  HistoryThe Anacostia Freeway was first conceived by the National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1950 as a connector route between the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at Kenilworth Avenue and the Capital Beltway near Oxon Hill. The route would provide access to the Anacostia waterfront, which included Bolling Air Force Base and the Anacostia Naval Station. In 1955, District officials approved the portion of the route between Suitland Parkway and E Capitol Street; the remainder of the route was approved in 1956. The southern portion of the route, from the Beltway to the 11th Street Bridges, was given a financial boost when it was included in the Interstate Highway System. The route was designated I-295 by AASHO in 1958.The first   of the route opened on August 7, 1964 when the connecting segment of the Capital Beltway opened. In 1990, the freeway was extended   south to connect with MD 210, to remove the significant traffic flow between the two routes from the segment of the Beltway between both interchanges. East LegUnder the 1971 D.C. freeway plans, I-295 would have turned east at the northern end of the 11th Street Bridges and followed the Southeast Freeway as far as East Capitol Street, where it would turn north and follow the East Leg of the Inner Loop freeway. The East Leg, six lanes wide, would have curved around the far eastern edge of the downtown area, passing beneath Mt. Olivet Road in a 1/2 mile tunnel, before terminating at I-66 and I-95 north of Union Station, providing access to the North Leg Freeway, the North Central Freeway, and the New York Avenue Industrial Freeway. FutureOne major interchange project was recently completed and another is under construction on I-295. Woodrow Wilson Bridge projectAs part of the larger Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge reconstruction project, the southern terminus of I-295 has been significantly rebuilt. Several new connections have been constructed to link the Beltway, MD 210 and I-295 with the new   National Harbor site, being built on the shore of the Potomac River in Prince George's County, Maryland. The interchange has been rebuilt to accommodate future ramps for proposed HOV lanes on the Beltway. The project was completed in stages starting in 2008 and ending in 2011. 11th Street Bridges projectA major project is currently underway to significantly rebuild the interchanges among the I-295, DC 295 and the 11th Street Bridges. The cancellation of both the remainder of the Southeast Freeway and then the  Barney Circle Freeway left no through connections between the 11th Street Bridges and DC 295 north, leading to severe congestion and major traffic routing problems. These missing movements now exist at these interchanges, allowing direct freeway-grade access to and from DC 295 at the 11th Street bridges as well as providing a through grade-separated north–south route within D.C. Project construction began in 2011 and the ramps opened in 2012. I-295 now terminates at the interchange with the 11th Street Bridges. I-695 extends over the 11th Street Bridges and continues along the Southeast Freeway to the interchange with I-395.

Interstate 295 (Maryland) 
Maryland v. Craig   Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause, which provides criminal defendants with the right to confront witnesses against them, did not bar the use of one-way closed-circuit television to present testimony by an alleged child sex abuse victim.  The child was reportedly unable to testify in the physical presence of the defendant due to severe emotional trauma.  The trial court set her up in a separate room with the judge, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney, so that the defendant and jury could only see her testify via the live television screen in the courtroom, and she could not see them.  The defendant was convicted, and the Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the use of the transmitted testimony, because the Confrontation Clause guaranteed face-to-face confrontation.  The Supreme Court reversed the Maryland high court, reinstating the conviction.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority, ruling that the Confrontation Clause merely embodies a "preference" for face-to-face, in person confrontation, which may be limited to satisfy sufficiently important interests.  Because the child witness was cross-examined by the defendant's attorney and her general demeanor was visible in the courtroom, the defendant had a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to test her credibility and the substance of her testimony before the jury.Craig came shortly after the Court had invalidated the use of a screen to hide a similarly situated child witness/victim in Coy v. Iowa.  The court in Coy found "no individualized findings (that the victims) needed special protection."  Indeed, "face-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset the truthful rape victim or abused child; but by the same token it may confound and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult."  In contrast, the Maryland statute in Craig provided for an exception when a child's testimony would result in "serious emotional distress."  Furthermore, the use of one-way closed-circuit TV did not considerably obstruct the jury's observation of the child's testimony.The court noted that the fundamental purpose of the 6th Amendment was to prevent ex parte affidavits.  Mattox v. United States 156 U.S. 237, 242 (1895).  It further identified four primary guarantees embodied in the Confrontation Clause:  The right of "personal examination" That a witness will testify under oath That a witness will submit to cross-examination That the jury may observe the demeanor of the witness in making his statement The court noted that hearsay exceptions demonstrated that no defendant had an absolute right to a face-to-face encounter with adversarial witnesses.  While the Maryland exception did not provide face-to-face confrontation, the final three preserved guarantees were present.  The State's interest in the physical and psychological well-being of child abuse victims could outweigh the defendant's right to face his accusers in court.The court remanded the case for a determination on the necessity of the accommodations.Justice Antonin Scalia, in dissent, wrote that he was "persuaded...that the Maryland procedure is virtually constitutional. Since it is not, however, actually constitutional I would affirm the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of conviction."Many states subsequently declined to follow Craigs reasoning when applying their own comparable constitutional provisions.  Some state constitutions furthermore expressly require confrontation to be "face to face", and so criminal defendants in those states will have the benefit of the broader state protections. The continued validity of this decision in the face of Crawford v. Washington has been called into question.  Craig relies in large part on Ohio v. Roberts, which was overturned by Crawford.  A petition for certiorari arguing this point was filed with the Supreme Court in March 2007.

Savage, Maryland Savage is a historic town located in Howard County, Maryland, about   south of Baltimore and   north of Washington, D.C. It is situated close to the city of Laurel and to the planned community of Columbia.The lands of Savage were first settled around 1650. Colonel Henry Ridgely surveyed the land around Savage Mill and nearby Annapolis Junction in 1685 naming the tract "Ridgely's Forrest". A rich vein of American industrial history lies in Savage. When the textile industry was in its heyday, Savage was an important manufacturing center, its mills harnessing the water power on the falls of the Little and Middle Patuxent Rivers.The town was named for John Savage, a Philadelphia merchant with interest in a mill on the falls of the Patuxent. In 1822 he and his associates, the Williams brothers, chartered the Savage Manufacturing Company.  The company produced sails for the clipper ships that sailed out of Baltimore Harbor, in addition to a wide variety of other cotton products.The cotton milling industry started in Maryland in the 18th century and flourished in the 19th century. Cotton was shipped cheaply from Southern ports and hauled overland by mule and oxen teams to the mills before rail transportation served Savage. In 1835 the Washington branch of the B&O Railroad was completed, and Savage Station was established on the line about a mile southeast of the present mill. A spur of the B&O was laid to the Savage factory in 1887, and it was at this time that the famous Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge was moved to its present site from another location. Originally built in 1852, it was one of about 100 on the B&O line. Beloved by railroad buffs, the iron truss bridge is the only one of its type in the world, and, along with the Savage Mill, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Parts of the Savage Mill are said to date from about 1820, and historians have recorded that the mill once had an iron foundry that made many kinds of machinery, specializing in textile manufacturing. The operation of the mill was greatly expanded in 1880 with the installation of steam power. Army uniforms, field tents, and vehicle covers were made.A renovation program began in 1984 that established Savage Mill as a major permanent marketplace. With its new role as a festive showcase for quality arts, crafts, antiques, and specialty items, Savage Mill is more than a "shopping mill." It's a leisurely place to explore, enjoy, and to appreciate the history of a quiet mill town on the banks of the Middle Patuxent River.The Savage Mill Manor House is found down the street from the Mill and has also been completely renovated.  It is now used to host weddings, parties and special events.Carroll Baldwin Hall once housed the Savage branch of the Howard County Library. It was built in the early 1920s as a memorial to Carroll Baldwin, former president of the manufacturing company. The Baldwins managed the company from 1859 to 1911.Singer/songwriter Benny Mardones — who holds an unusual place in United States recording history as a "one-hit wonder" who actually hit the Top 20 twice, in 1980 and 1989, with the same recording of the same song, "Into the Night" — was raised in Savage but was born in Cleveland, Ohio.

Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine   The Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine (VMRCVM) is a state-supported college of two states, Virginia and Maryland, filling the need for veterinary medicine education in both states.  Students from both states are considered "in-state" students for admissions purposes. VMRCVM is one of 28 colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States. It is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association's Council on Education (AVMA COE) and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). In 2011, the U.S. News 'Veterinary Medicine' Ranking placed the college tied for 17th with Iowa State University in a poll of 25 ranked schools. The college is considered a constituent college of both Virginia Tech and the University of Maryland, College Park. The college's main campus is located on Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg, Virginia, with a branch on the University of Maryland's campus in College Park, Maryland. It also operates the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in Leesburg, Virginia. The college's Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program is designed to be finished in four years. The first three years are spent at the Blacksburg campus; for the final year, students do clinical rotations at two veterinary teaching hospitals in Blacksburg and with private practitioners. Some students do rotations at the branches at College Park or Leesburg.  History Historically, there was a shortage of veterinary colleges in the southern and Mid-Atlantic states. In 1950, the state of Maryland began a contract to allow 10 Maryland students to attend the vet school at the University of Georgia in exchange for the admittance of 10 Georgia residents into the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. By 1972, Maryland expanded its relationship with out-of-state vet schools to include Tuskegee University, Ohio State University, University of Florida, University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell University. Virginia also tried to address the absence of an in-state veterinary school. In 1971, Virginia entered into contracts administered by the Southern Regional Education Board, allotting 15 seats to Virginia students in the University of Georgia's veterinary school and two seats at Tuskegee University's school.In June 1971, the Virginia Veterinary Medical Association initiated a study of the need for and feasibility of a college of veterinary medicine. In 1973, a commission of veterinarians and members of the Virginia General Assembly found that Virginia did need a veterinary college to adequately meet its need for veterinary services. The commission recommended that this college should be a regional college, should emphasize service to farmers in Virginia, and should be located at Virginia Tech.In 1978, the Virginia General Assembly officially established the college as a part of Virginia Tech, one of Virginia's two land-grant universities. Meanwhile, in Maryland, the State Board of Regents decided in 1977 to establish a veterinary school at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore; however, on May 11, 1979, the Board of Regents decided to join the Virginia school instead.  In February 1980, a memorandum of understanding with the then-Virginia school stated that 24 slots in the entering class would be reserved for Maryland students and 40 places would be allocated to Virginia students. This founding class of 64 students entered the college on September 15, 1980 and graduated with DVM degrees in May 1984. The new college was fully accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association in 1990.In 2009, the college established a partnership with the American University of Antigua (AUA) that permitted students to attend AUA for their first four semesters and then transfer to VMRCVM for their last five semesters; however, AUA ended its veterinary medical program in 2011. The college opened a $10.5 million, 16,000-square-foot Infectious Disease Research Facility in November 2011 and completed a $14.1 million, 30,000-square-foot Veterinary Medicine Instruction Addition in the fall of 2012. Located on the Blacksburg campus, both facilities connect to the main VMRCVM complex. Starting with the Class of 2016, VMRCVM expanded the number of students in its DVM program. Of the 120 anticipated spots, 50 are reserved for Virginia residents and 30 for Maryland residents. The remaining spots are for at-large applications and include space for up to six West Virginia residents under a new agreement.  AcademicsThe Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine offers students a DVM degree or an M.S. or Ph.D. in biomedical and veterinary sciences. The college also has a joint program with the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine that leads to a master of public health. In addition to these degrees, students may participate in residency and internships in their desired fields of interest. Doctor of Veterinary Medicine ProgramThe college offers a four-year full-time program leading to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree. The first three years are taught in a case-based and traditional lecture/laboratory format. At the end of the first year, students choose a track: small animal, food animal, equine, mixed species, or public/corporate veterinary medicine. Students then take courses specific to their track for the next two years. In their senior year, which is 12 months in length, students train for veterinary practice by participating in clinical rotations.Over the past five years, the Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine’s DVM program has had over 96 percent of its students pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE). In 2010-11, all of the college’s 85 graduating students passed the exam. Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences ProgramThe Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences program is part of the Graduate School at Virginia Tech. The program offers a Ph.D. degree that requires 90 credit hours of course work, research, and a dissertation. The Ph.D. can be completed in four years, and prospective students do not need a master’s degree to apply. The master’s degree requires 30 credit hours of coursework, research, and a thesis and can be completed in two years. The college also has a dual-degree program that leads to both a DVM and Ph.D. in six years. In this program, students can pursue research opportunities in biomedical and/or clinical studies. Master of Public HealthIn collaboration with the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, VMRCVM offers a master’s degree in public health, a 42-credit-hour professional program in the new Department of Population Health Sciences. Residency and InternshipsThe Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine provides students with discipline-specific residency programs. All VMRCVM residents must complete a graduate degree (M.S. or Ph.D.). Small-animal clinical residencies and large-animal clinical residencies are designed to provide three to four years of advanced training in specific disciplines in preparation for certification examination by appropriate specialty boards within the veterinary profession. The biomedical sciences and pathobiology residencies, which are part of a combined residency/Ph.D. program, prepare graduates for careers in veterinary clinical pathology or anatomic pathology. The Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center offers residency programs in equine internal medicine and surgery. These programs are fully approved by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and the American College of Veterinary Surgery.VMRCVM internships are designed to provide post-DVM students with the opportunity for experience in advanced diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in medicine and surgery as well as seminary and manuscript preparation. Internships are also aimed at providing students with training and experience in clinical instruction and preparing them for residency and graduate study or clinical practice. HospitalsStudents of the Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine can gain veterinary experience by working in one of the college’s hospitals: the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which comprises the Small Animal Hospital and the Henry T. Peters Large Animal Hospital, or the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center. Veterinary Teaching HospitalThe Veterinary Teach Hospital, which comprises the Small Animal Hospital and the Harry T. Peters, Jr. Large Animal Hospital, provides care to local clients within a 35-mile radius of Blacksburg. Since the hospital focuses on teaching, residents and interns work closely with clinical faculty members to provide care to small and large animals. Fourth-year veterinary students in the DVM program spend their final year in three-week clerkships designed to give them hands-on experience; these students welcome patients, record a case history, and conduct the initial examination of the animal prior to consulting with the supervising veterinarian. Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical CenterThe Marion DuPont Scott Equine Medical Center is a full-service equine hospital located in Leesburg, Virginia, that offers advanced specialty care, 24-hour emergency treatment and diagnostic services for all ages and breeds of horses. The center, which opened in 1984, has board-certified veterinarians in anesthesia, internal medicine, and surgery, as well as veterinarians in residency training programs and licensed veterinary technicians. Since the center’s inception, faculty members have played a key role in the development of both Marquis, the first FDA-approved treatment for equine protozoal myelitis, and GastroGard, a treatment for gastric ulcers, as well as advances in laser surgery joint disease, and treatments for lameness, colic, tumors, tendon and ligament injury, and antibiotic therapy. ResearchStudents may also gain experience through the college’s various research centers, which are spread out across Virginia and Maryland. Under the leadership of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, VMRCVM conducts a broad spectrum of basic/molecular and translational/applied research with a focus on animal health and productivity as well as human health and wellbeing.Additionally, the school operates a library on its Blacksburg campus that is a part of the Virginia Tech library system.  Center for Public and Corporate Veterinary MedicineThe Center for Public and Corporate Veterinary Medicine (CPCVM) is located on the College Park, Maryland campus of VMRCVM.  Primarily, the CPCVM supervises the public and corporate track of the DVM program.  It also coordinates internship opportunities and provides summer fellowship experiences for veterinary students from across the United States as well as from several other countries. Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious DiseasesThe central theme of the Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases (CMMID) is “Animal Model of Diseases.” The faculty specializes in using various animal models that include not only traditional laboratory animal models (mice and rats), but also non-traditional (chickens, pigs, dogs, fish, crab, equine) animal models. CMMID employs animal models to better understand the disease processes that impact both humans and domesticated species. The center is geared toward addressing current problems in public health that require the use of appropriate animal and tissue culture models, as well as gene-expression analysis. Center for Comparative OncologyThe Center for Comparative Oncology (CeCO) is an academic center for basic and clinical research on cancer. The center, which opened in 2002, unites a variety of cancer research programs on the Virginia Tech campus. It seeks to understand the development of cancer in animals and in people, to develop new ways to diagnose cancer and to find new treatments to control and cure it. Center for Animal Human RelationshipsThe Center for Animal Human Relationships (CENTAUR) is an academic center conducting instructional, research, and outreach programs designed to foster a greater understanding of the mutual benefits associated with human-animal interaction. It provides education, research, and service related to the therapeutic benefits of companion animals. Center for Reproductive Excellence Using Advanced Technology and EndocrinologyThe Center for Reproductive Excellence using Advanced Technology and Endocrinology (CREATE) has three board-certified theriogenologists, each with their own research and species interests. The CREATE Lab offers advanced reproductive services—from breeding soundness and infertility evaluations to genetic counseling—for the following species: equine, bovine, canine, feline, ovine, and caprine. Laboratory for Neurotoxicity StudiesThe Virginia Tech Laboratory for Neurotoxicity Studies conducts investigations studying the effects of toxins on the nervous system. Currently, the laboratory is conducting interdisciplinary research in experimental neurotoxicology studying the effects of agents such as pesticides, solvents, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and nanomaterials in in vitro and in vivo models, funded by federal agencies and industries. Faculty with expertise in toxicology, pharmacology, neuropathology, and veterinary pathology conduct this work. Veterinary Medical Informatics LaboratoryThe Veterinary Medical Informatics Laboratory (VMIL) is an interdisciplinary research and service program within the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. VMIL studies conceptual and structural features of the medical information unique to animals. VMIL also assists in analysis and development of medical information models, databases, and systems. In addition to its research, VMIL acts as a service program by developing terminologies for veterinary organizations. Future PlansThe college has plans for a 90,000-square-foot Translational Medicine Building, which will expand the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and create additional research and training spaces. The new facility will be a collaboration with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Science at Virginia Tech.  References  External links    Tech}}             
Samuel Smith (Maryland)      Samuel Smith (July 27, 1752 April 22, 1839) was a United States Senator and Representative from Maryland, a mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, and a general in the Maryland militia. He was the brother of cabinet secretary Robert Smith. BiographyBorn in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Smith moved with his family to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1759. He attended a private academy, and engaged in mercantile pursuits until the American Revolutionary War, at which time he served as captain, major, and lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army. Prior to the war, as a young captain, he was sent to Annapolis to arrest Governor Eden and seize his papers.  After the war, Smith engaged in the shipping business.  From 1790 to 1792, Smith was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. At the time of the threatened war with France in 1794, he was appointed brigadier general of the Maryland militia and commanded Maryland’s quota during the Whiskey Rebellion. Smith served as a major general of Maryland militia during the War of 1812, and commanded the defenses of Baltimore during the Battle of Baltimore and Fort McHenry in 1814. The American victory there can largely be attributed to Smith's preparation for the British invasion.Smith entered into national politics when he was elected to the Third United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1793, until March 4, 1803. As a Congressman, Smith served as chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Commerce and Manufactures (Fifth through Seventh Congresses). As a principal negotiator between the young Federalist leader and Delaware representative, James Asheton Bayard II, and the presumptive President-Elect Jefferson, Smith secured the winning ballot in the United States House of Representatives for Jefferson during the United States presidential election, 1800.   Smith entered into the Senate election in 1802, and was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States Senate. He was re-elected in 1808 and served from March 4, 1803 until March 4, 1815. While senator, Smith served as President pro tempore of the Senate during the Ninth and Tenth Congresses.Smith was elected to the Fourteenth Congress on January 31, 1816 to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Nicholas R. Moore, and was re-elected to the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Congresses. In the House, Smith served as chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Treasury (Fourteenth Congress), and as a member of the Committee on Ways and Means (Fifteenth through Seventeenth Congresses).On December 17, 1822, Smith resigned as congressman, having been elected as a Democratic Republican (later Crawford Republican and Jacksonian) to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William Pinkney. Smith served as President pro tempore of the Senate during the Twentieth and Twenty-first Congresses, and as chairman of the Committee on Finance (Eighteenth and Twentieth through Twenty-second Congresses). He was re-elected in 1826 and served until March 4, 1833. Two years later, in 1835, Smith became mayor of Baltimore, and served in that position until 1838, when he retired from public life. Smith died in Baltimore in 1839, and is interred in the Old Westminster Burying Ground. Attitudes to slaveryIn 1828 Smith served as Vice-President of the Maryland State Colonization Society, of which Charles Carroll of Carrollton, one of the co-signers of the Declaration of Independence, was president.  The MSCS was a branch of the American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to returning black Americans to lead free lives in African states such as Liberia.

Maryland, My Maryland   "Maryland, My Maryland" is the official state song of the U.S. state of Maryland. The song is set to the tune of "Lauriger Horatius"  (better known as the tune of "O Tannenbaum") and the lyrics are from a nine-stanza poem written by James Ryder Randall.  While the words were penned in 1861, it was not until April 29, 1939, that the state's general assembly adopted "Maryland, My Maryland" as the state song. Written originally as a poem by James Randall, the song refers to Maryland's history and geography and specifically mentions several historical figures of importance to the state.  The song calls for Maryland to fight the Union and was used across the South during the Civil War as a battle hymn.   It has been called America's "most martial poem." Occasional attempts have been made to replace it as Maryland's state song due to its origin in support for the Confederacy and lyrics that refer to President Lincoln as a "tyrant," "despot," and "Vandal," and to the Union as "Northern scum."  Origin The poem was a result of events at the beginning of the American Civil War.  During the secession crisis, President Abraham Lincoln (referred to in the poem as "the despot" and "the tyrant") ordered federal troops to be brought to Washington, D.C. to protect the capital.  Many of these troops were brought through Baltimore City, a major transportation hub.  There was considerable Confederate sympathy in Maryland at the time.  Riots ensued as Federal troops came through Baltimore on their way south in April 1861 and were attacked by mobs.  A number of Union troops and Baltimore residents were killed in the Baltimore riots, including Francis X. Ward, a friend of James Ryder Randall.  Randall, a native Marylander, was teaching at Poydras College in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, at the time and, moved by the news of his friend's death, wrote the nine-stanza poem, "Maryland, My Maryland".  The poem was a plea to his home state of Maryland to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy.  The poem contains many references to the Revolutionary War as well as to the Mexican-American War and Maryland figures in that war (many of whom have fallen into obscurity).  It was first published in the New Orleans Sunday Delta on 26 April 1861.The poem was quickly turned into a song, by putting it to the tune "Lauriger Horatius", by Miss Jennie Carrie, sister of Hetty Cary.   It became instantly popular in Maryland and throughout the South.  It was sometimes called "the Marseillaise of the South." Confederate States Army bands played the song after they crossed into Maryland territory during the Maryland Campaign in 1862.     According to some accounts, General Robert E. Lee ordered his troops to sing "Maryland, My Maryland," as they entered the town of Frederick, Maryland, but his troops received a cold response, as Frederick was located in the unionist western portion of the state.   At least one Confederate regimental band also played the song as Lee's troops retreated back across the Potomac after the bloody Battle of Antietam. Lyrics I  The despot's heel is on thy shore, Maryland!* His torch is at thy temple door, Maryland! Avenge the patriotic gore That flecked the streets of Baltimore, And be the battle queen of yore, Maryland! My Maryland!  II  Hark to an exiled son's appeal, Maryland! My mother State! to thee I kneel, Maryland! For life and death, for woe and weal, Thy peerless chivalry reveal, And gird thy beauteous limbs with steel, Maryland! My Maryland!  III  Thou wilt not cower in the dust, Maryland! Thy beaming sword shall never rust, Maryland! Remember Carroll's sacred trust, Remember Howard's warlike thrust,- And all thy slumberers with the just, Maryland! My Maryland!  IV  Come! 'tis the red dawn of the day, Maryland! Come with thy panoplied array, Maryland! With Ringgold's spirit for the fray, With Watson's blood at Monterey, With fearless Lowe and dashing May, Maryland! My Maryland!  V  Come! for thy shield is bright and strong, Maryland! Come! for thy dalliance does thee wrong, Maryland! Come to thine own anointed throng, Stalking with Liberty along, And chaunt thy dauntless slogan song, Maryland! My Maryland!  VI  Dear Mother! burst the tyrant's chain, Maryland! Virginia should not call in vain, Maryland! She meets her sisters on the plain- "Sic semper!" 'tis the proud refrain That baffles minions back amain, Arise in majesty again, Maryland! My Maryland!  VII  I see the blush upon thy cheek, Maryland! For thou wast ever bravely meek, Maryland! But lo! there surges forth a shriek, From hill to hill, from creek to creek- Potomac calls to Chesapeake, Maryland! My Maryland!  VIII  Thou wilt not yield the Vandal toll, Maryland! Thou wilt not crook to his control, Maryland! Better the fire upon thee roll, Better the blade, the shot, the bowl, Than crucifixion of the soul, Maryland! My Maryland!  IX  I hear the distant thunder-hum, Maryland! The Old Line's bugle, fife, and drum, Maryland! She is not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb- Huzza! she spurns the Northern scum! She breathes! she burns! she'll come! she'll come! Maryland! My Maryland!   *  Although the words as written, and as adopted by statute, contain only one instance of "Maryland" in the second and fourth line of each stanza, common practice is to sing "Maryland, my Maryland" each time to keep with the meter of the tune. Later influence"Florida, My Florida", "Michigan, My Michigan" and "The Song of Iowa"  are set to the same tune.  All three were written after "Maryland, My Maryland". In 1962 Edmund Wilson used the phrase "patriotic gore" from the song as the title of his book on the literature of the American Civil War. The third verse of this song is sung annually at the Preakness Stakes by the United States Naval Academy men's glee club.  References   Maryland State Archives (2004).

Maryland Transportation Authority     The Maryland Transportation Authority (MdTA) is an independent state agency responsible for financing, constructing, operating, and maintaining eight toll facilities, currently consisting of two toll roads, two tunnels, and four bridges in Maryland.       It also provides the Maryland Department of Transportation with "conduit" financing for other revenue producing transportation projects.   Agency structureThe MdTA was established in 1971 to take over functions previously performed by the former State Roads Commission.  Financially independent from Maryland's general fund and transportation trust fund, the Authority operates as a purely enterprise agency, providing services on a user charge basis similar to the operation of a commercial enterprise. Its capital projects and operations are funded by tolls, concessions, investment income, and revenue bonds.  In addition to its own toll facilities, the Authority finances construction of other revenue-producing transportation facilities for the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). These projects have included improvements at the Port of Baltimore and the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. To provide construction funding, the Authority issues revenue bonds, which will be paid off over a period of years by tolls and other user fees generated by the facilities. The MdTA can issue either taxable or exempt bonds to finance large scale projects. As of June 30, 2010, the Authority had outstanding revenue bonds totaling $2.7 billion. Most of this debt was in the form of transportation facility revenue bonds valued at $1.6 billion, for MdTA toll facilities. Grant and Revenue Anticipation (GARVEE) bonds, secured by federal grants and revenue pledged from individual projects, comprised $651 million of the debt. Conduit revenue bonds, for the construction of transportation parking and airport passenger facilities, also secured by federal grants and the future revenue of specific facilities, comprised the rest of the debt. Unlike the transportation facility bonds, the conduit and GARVEE bonds are pledged to revenue sources managed by other agencies, external to the MdTA.  Governing boardThe Maryland Secretary of Transportation serves as chairperson of the Authority's governing board. Eight other board members are appointed to four year terms by the Governor, with confirmation by the Maryland Senate. Term expirations are staggered. Board members can be reappointed to additional terms, but a limit of three consecutive terms was established in 2007.     Daily operations of the Authority are overseen by an executive secretary who serves as the chief executive officer for the agency and is hired by the MDTA Board.  Members of the board, 2011:   Beverley K. Swaim-Staley, chair (does not count toward a quorum). Randolph P. Brown, acting executive secretary: replaced 10/2011 by Harold Bartlett Peter J. Basso Rev. Dr. William C. Calhoun, Sr. Mary Beyer Halsey Louise P. Hoblitzell: retired 10/2011 Richard C. Mike Lewin: resigned 11/2011 Michael J. Whitson Walter E. Woodford Jr. P.E.  As of April 2012, there is one vacancy. Swaim-Staley announced her retirement as of July 1, 2012. Members are:  Peter J. Basso Rev. Dr. William C. Calhoun, Sr. Mary Beyer Halsey Arthur Hock Brad Mims Michael J. Whitson Walter E. Woodford, Jr., P.E.  The chairman is always the Maryland Secretary of Transportation. The chair has an absolute veto on all decisions, that is, no policy can be adopted or action carried out without the "concurrence" of the chair. However, it seems this is rarely needed, since minutes since 2007 show the board has a habit of voting unanimously in all cases.The Capital Committee members are Woodford, Whitson, Calhoun and Mims. The Finance Committee members are Basso, Halsey and Hock. There are other standing committees which do not hold public meetings: Human Resources and Audit. Their status as "public bodies" under state law is uncertain.Members as of April 2012 are:  Human Resources Committee Calhoun – Chair; Basso; Halsey  Audit Committee Basso – Chair; Halsey; Hock   The MDTA Board and its two active standing committees (Capital Committee and Finance Committee) have been found in violation of the Maryland Open Meetings Act a number of times between 2009 and 2012. In response to one of the complaints, the MDTA began notifying the public of Finance and Capital committee meetings; allowing the public to attend them; and began putting meeting schedules and minutes of the two committees and the Board online. The MDTA maintains tape recordings of meetings at its offices on Broening Highway, Baltimore. Meeting audio or video is not available through their website.The specific Maryland Open Meetings Compliance Board Opinions are found here in PDF format:7 OMCB 30 7 OMCB 647 OMCB 1187 OMCB 1407 OMCB 1767 OMCB 1957 OMCB 2828 OMCB 88 OMCB 27These two are not yet online but were issued in March and April 2012:8 OMCB 468 OMCB 56 MdTA Police  The Maryland Transportation Authority Police were established in 1971 as part of the MdTA. Their mission includes protecting several other transportation facilities such as the Port of Baltimore and BWI Airport, as well as the Authority's own facilities.   Facilities Currently operating toll facilitiesThe MdTA operates the following toll facilities:   Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge – crossing the Susquehanna River on U.S. Route 40 between Harford and Cecil counties William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge (Chesapeake Bay Bridge) – crossing the Chesapeake Bay on U.S. Routes 50/301 between Anne Arundel and Queen Anne's counties Francis Scott Key Bridge – outer crossing of the Baltimore Harbor on I-695, the Baltimore Beltway Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge – crossing the Potomac River on U.S. Route 301 between Charles County, Maryland and King George County, Virginia John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway – the   section of I-95 traversing northeastern Maryland from the Baltimore city line to the Delaware state line  Fort McHenry Tunnel – I-95 crossing the Baltimore Harbor Baltimore Harbor Tunnel – I-895 crossing the Baltimore Harbor Maryland Route 200 - the Intercounty Connector  Most of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway is not actually a toll road. Tolls are collected only on the northbound side, at a toll plaza located a mile north of the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge. Northbound vehicles departing the highway prior the bridge or entering north of the bridge, and southbound vehicles, travel toll-free.  Intercounty Connector  Maryland Route 200, the Intercounty Connector (ICC), will link existing and proposed development areas of Montgomery County and Prince George's County between Interstate 370 at Shady Grove and Interstate 95 in Laurel with an   east–west limited-access highway.     The $2.4 billion project is being financed by MdTA, with the Maryland State Highway Administration serving as the project manager for engineering and construction.  When the first segment of the ICC opened on February 23, 2011, it became the first toll facility in Maryland with fully automated toll collection. Connecting Interstate 370 with Maryland Route 97, the first segment is   long.  Express Toll lanesThe MdTA began construction of the Express Toll lanes on a congested portion of Interstate 95, north of Downtown Baltimore, in May 2005. When completed, the new toll system will extend for  , from the east side of Baltimore City, at the Interstate 895 split, into Baltimore County, north of Maryland Route 43 in White Marsh. This segment of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway (Interstate 95) will have two Express Toll and four general purpose lanes in each direction. Tolls for using the Express Toll lanes will vary, depending on traffic conditions, to reduce congestion. The general purpose lanes will continue to operate toll-free.  Other facilitiesThe MdTA has owned the Canton Railroad, which operates as a for-profit enterprise, since 1987.  Toll increasesToll increases to become effective at all Maryland toll facilities on October 1, 2011 were proposed by the Authority's board on June 2, 2011. These changes are expected to raise an additional $77 million during the first fiscal year after their implementation. Additional revenue was considered necessary by the board to expand highway capacity and rehabilitate aging infrastructure.   The most recent toll increase was in 2009, but it affected only vehicles with three or more axles. Drivers of passenger vehicles have not seen a toll increase since 2003. When the first span of the Bay Bridge opened in 1952, drivers of passenger vehicles paid $2.80 for the round trip, plus $.25 per passenger; a toll of $4.00 is currently charged for east-bound cars.

Maryland Route 200  Maryland Route 200 (MD 200), more commonly known as the Intercounty Connector or ICC, is a partially completed tolled freeway under construction in Maryland which connects Gaithersburg in Montgomery County and Laurel in Prince George's County. When completed, it will reach the community of Konterra just north of Beltsville.  The highway was originally proposed in the 1960s as part of the Washington Outer Beltway. While other parts of the Outer Beltway were canceled, the ICC and the Fairfax County Parkway remained on master plans. The road's long history as an unbuilt proposed road stems from the controversy that has surrounded it over the years.Proponents of the highway have claimed that it will improve the flow of interregional traffic, relieving traffic congestion on local roads. Opponents of the highway have claimed that the road will (with a few limited exceptions) harm significant traffic flow characteristics (such as increasing drive times, congestion, and costs in the form of tolls), will negatively harm the environment (with air, sea and land impacts), and will disrupt established communities through which it passes.   Fulfilling a 2002 campaign promise, Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich pushed to begin construction of the road and conducted a formal groundbreaking in October 2006.  With additional support from his successor, Governor Martin O'Malley,    construction began on November 13, 2007.  The first segment, from I-370 to Maryland Route 28, officially opened on February 23, 2011, while the extension to Interstate 95 opened on November 22, 2011. Route description    Currently openMD 200 begins at a trumpet interchange with Interstate 370 (I-370) near Gaithersburg in Montgomery County, between its MD 355 and Shady Grove Road interchanges as a six-lane freeway. Several new ramps and collector-distributor roads were built between this interchange and MD 355. MD 200 continues northeast from there through Redland Station, turning east to pass over Shady Grove Road, and then under Redland Road, paralleling Mill Creek. This is the location of the eastbound toll gantry. MD 200 shortly curves to the east on the approach to the six-lane overpass for Olde Mill Run, which was built wide enough for a fourth lane in the eastbound direction. The Olde Mill Run overpass is the only section of MD 200 with full   shoulders on each side. After the overpass, MD 200 turns southeast, passing under Needwood Road, before turning sharply back to the east as it passes under MD 115 (Muncaster Mill Road). The route, now running slightly to the southeast begins the approach to MD 97 (Georgia Avenue).MD 200 turns more eastward, running towards North Branch Stream Valley Park, and passing over the north branch of Rock Creek and a second stream over a bridge. This is the location of the westbound toll gantry. The route enters the Norbeck area, and passes under Emory Lane. Just east of there is where a hybrid cloverleaf interchange with MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) is located. A park-and-ride may be built at this interchange. When the road opened in February 2011, it temporarily came to an end at a traffic light located just east of MD 97 at MD 28 (Norbeck Road). The route then curves southeastward, passing under MD 28 and Longmead Crossing Drive, running parallel to Wintergate Drive/Park Vista Drive. MD 200 then curves slightly more eastward toward Aspen Hill, where the freeway intersects MD 182 (Layhill Road), shortly after entering the Northwest Branch Recreational Park.  The route travels though the park for a stretch, bridging the Northwest Branch three times (the second bridge also carries MD 200 over Bonifant Road), exits the park, and then turns eastward, passing under Notley Road.  MD 200 then turns slightly to the northeast near Colesville and meets MD 650 at a single-point urban interchange.MD 200 then continues eastward, passes through Upper Paint Branch Park and bridges several creeks, including the namesake Paint Branch, and passes between several neighborhoods upon exiting the park. The route then passes under Old Columbia Pike with no access to this local road.    Just beyond, MD 200 reaches a large interchange with US 29, combining cloverleaf and stack elements.  This interchange also adds connections to Fairland Road with both MD 200 and US 29. The route continues eastward, featuring a partial interchange with Briggs Chaney Road (westbound exit and eastbound entrance), and then, just after crossing the border into Prince George's County, it passes over the Little Paint Branch just south of the Fairland Recreational Park.  The route then passes under Old Gunpowder Road.The route then enters Calverton, where the expansive interchange with I-95 is located. The interchange, marked as Exit 31 on I-95, is mostly a cloverleaf hybrid, and features several collector-distributor roads built along I-95, stretching from Old Gunpowder Road south of the interchange to MD 198 north of it. The community of Konterra is planned for construction near this interchange. Future segmentBeyond I-95, MD 200 will narrow to four lanes.  MD 200 curves sharply to the north and shortly curves sharply back to the east, and meets a diamond-interchange providing access to Virginia Manor Road. MD 200 then curves sharply to the southeast and will quickly end at a traffic-signal at US 1 (Baltimore Avenue) in Beltsville.The entire length of MD 200 will be   long, though the toll portion of the highway is only   of this distance.  TollsThe Intercounty Connector uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or billed using Automatic Number Plate Recognition. ICC users without E-ZPass are mailed a bill to pay the toll along with a 50% surcharge for non-E-ZPass use (minimum of $1).    The tolls along the full length of the road (between I-370 and I-95) vary by time of day, ranging from $1.60 overnight to $3.20 in off-peak daytime, and $4 at rush hour (for E-ZPass users; for others toll rates will be approximately 50% higher).  Tolls were waived along the road between February 23 and March 7, 2011, and again between November 22 and December 4, 2011. History  Washington Outer BeltwayThe ICC can be traced to plans developed in the 1950s for an Outer Beltway. The original Outer Beltway had been planned to pass south of the corporate limits of Rockville. Plans for most of the ICC alignment under construction in 2009 (between I-370 and the Trolley Museum site) were developed in the 1960s, and ran to the north and west of the original alignment.  Even though the ICC does not cross the Potomac River, the new route was motivated in part by a desire to re-route an Outer Beltway crossing of the Potomac River upstream from the area of River Bend to Watkins Island. In 1975, the the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB) of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments endorsed a request from the State Highway Administration "for federal support of a $1.1 million planning and engineering study of the first 8-mile segment of the road" (then called the Outer Beltway), which was to "run from the Baltimore-Washington Parkway near Beltsville westward to a point near Interstate Rte 70S at Gaithersburg."  However, the current route of the ICC follows that alignment only from a point near the site of the National Capital Trolley Museum east to US 1 (Baltimore Avenue) in Beltsville. Initial Intercounty Connector planIn 1980, the state of Maryland dropped the Outer Beltway from its plans, with the exception of the Intercounty Connector.     In 1983, the federal National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) formally requested that the eastern end of the ICC be shortened by four miles, so that the eastern terminus of the road would be at I-95, not the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  In 1984, Maryland Secretary of Transportation Lowell K. Bridwell designated land in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties as the future site of the Intercounty Connector so that the right-of-way would be preserved,  even though Montgomery County Executive Charles W. Gilchrist had voiced very critical comments about the ICC as it was envisioned in 1983 – at least in part because he felt that construction of the ICC by the year 2000 was "infeasible", and advocated construction of a "shorter and less-costly" east-west highway instead. Prior to Governor Parris N. Glendening declaring the ICC "dead" before leaving office in January 2003, two environmental impact studies had been conducted. In 1977, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center expressed concerns about the impact that the ICC would have on its experiments.  An initial environmental study was undertaken in the late 1970s, and extended into the 1980s. A second study was initiated around 1992, and a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was issued in 1997. The Final Environmental Impact Statement was drafted by 1989 but did not receive federal approval, leading to the abandonment of the study until a new study began in 1992; the 1992-1997 study pointed to a similar conclusion, though it was never completed. By 1997, millions of dollars had been spent on planning and preliminary engineering, but the only segments of the road that had been built were I-370 between I-270 and the Shady Grove Metrorail station on WMATA's Red Line.  Glendening rejects Transportation Solutions Group recommendationsAfter the 1997 ICC DEIS process was put on hold by Governor Glendening, much controversy resulted between groups and persons in favor of the ICC and those opposed.  The ICC became a political issue in 1998,  an election year in Maryland. A blue-ribbon committee entitled the Transportation Solutions Group (TSG) was formed in 1998 to tell the Governor's Smart Growth Sub-Cabinet about intermodal transportation that complied with state and regional goals.  The TSG, chaired by Thomas B. Deen, former executive director of the Transportation Research Board, met at a series of meetings over about 14 months in 1998 and 1999.  Policy suggestions and recommendations made by the TSG included that most of the group supports "providing high-speed bus transit, HOV and SOV access through a new east-west, value priced, limited-access parkway", with some opposition to the parkway  and that the group had a divided opinion on a freeway, with most supporting it.  The TSG had initially voted to oppose the ICC on its master planned route,  but voted 10 in favor and 4 opposed in February 1999 to endorse a highway alternative with the condition that single-occupant vehicles be charged a toll.  At its final meeting in June 1999, the TSG held a public hearing in College Park and voted 12 to 4 in favor of a "parkway-like highway from I-270 to I-95, following the general path of the ICC."  The TSG also made a recommendation that a system of high-occupancy toll lanes (with variable pricing) be implemented on major freeways of the region, including the ICC, I-95, the Capital Beltway, I-270 and US 50.  On September 22, 1999, Glendening chose to reject the TSG recommendation, asserting that the project was "wrong" and "inconsistent with Smart Growth doctrine"  and was quoted by The Washington Post as saying, "It is a proposal that has fractured our communities. It has pitted neighbor against neighbor. And it has created political gridlock while traffic gridlock has only worsened."  Even though Glendening chose to ignore the TSG's primary recommendation, its work was not entirely in vain, as its efforts were to be cited prominently some years later in the ICC's Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS).  The concept of a regionwide network of HOT lanes (to be called "variably priced highway lanes") was further developed by the the TPB, and a regional network (including the ICC) was described in a report published in February 2008.  After rejecting the ICC, Glendening and opponents of the ICC then examined the possibility of selling its right-of-way, but proponents of the ICC would have been able to stop such a sale at the Board of Public Works,  which must approve transactions involving the sale of state-owned real estate. Montgomery County steps inIn 1999, staff to the Montgomery County Planning Board said that the ICC could be removed from master plans, but that such an effort would take "six or seven years" to accomplish.  In November 1999, the Montgomery County Council discussed removing the ICC from master plans, and while five of the nine members were opposed to the ICC, the District 4 member, the late Marilyn Praisner, declined to agree to removal of the master-planned route, for fear that the so-called Northern Alignment (Corridor 2 in the 2005 Draft Environmental Impact Statement) would become a de facto ICC in the future.  The effort by Montgomery County politicians to remove the ICC from its plans irritated powerful members of the Maryland General Assembly (notably Senate President Thomas V. "Mike" Miller), who discussed legislative measures that could be taken in the General Assembly to thwart such a move.   In February 2000, an agreement between Montgomery County's politicians and members of the General Assembly reached an agreement "memorialized in two letters but not cast in stone" that the "... Council agreed not to take any action to kill the ICC during the next three years." In 2000, Montgomery County Planning Board established the Transportation Policy Report and then the more-inclusive Transportation Policy Report II Task Force "... in an effort to establish a framework for future Master Plans and to help set priorities for future infrastructure."  The TPR II Task Force had 33 members, including persons in favor of the ICC and those opposed.  The TPR II Task Force listed the ICC in its recommended network, following a caveat that "If they are found feasible and ultimately judged desirable to implement,  the priority of implementation could be established at that time.  When the Montgomery County Council was briefed on the report, discussions quickly shifted to the ICC and the controversy associated with it.  The ICC's FEIS makes specific reference to the work done by the TPR II Task Force. The Maryland State Senate, in its 2002 session, passed Senate Joint Resolution 8, which asked Glendening to restart the ICC Environmental Impact Statement that had been put on hold in 1997. The Maryland House of Delegates passed an accompanying resolution, House Joint Resolution 10 with essentially similar provisions. The ICC study was not to be restarted until Glendening left office at the end of 2002. Revival In 2003, Governor Ehrlich followed through with his campaign promise to resurrect the ICC study  and was allowed a fast track review process by the United States Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta. In addition to the election of Ehrlich, the Montgomery County Council that was seated at the end of 2002 had a 6-3 majority of members in favor of the project. Prior to the 2002 election, a majority had been skeptical (if not outright opposed) to the project. On April 21, 2004, the TPB voted to include the ICC in future networks of the Washington region's transportation system for purposes of forecasting changes in air quality.  On November 17, 2004, the TPB endorsed regional transportation plans which included the ICC, determining that the proposed plans met air quality goals and that funding for the project was adequate. On July 11, 2005, Governor Ehrlich announced the state's preference to build the ICC along Corridor 1. Corridor 1 (approximately 80% of which is the Master Plan Alignment) has been on the books for decades; Corridor 2, also known as the Northern Alignment, was designed to reduce Corridor 1's impact on the environment. While the EPA gave Corridor 2 a higher environmental rating,  it was eventually rejected by the state due to the increased number of homes and businesses that would have to be removed for its construction, because of negative environmental impacts on the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission's Rocky Gorge Reservoir on the Patuxent River  (which is a source of drinking water for much of the WSSC service area),   and because it was not consistent with several approved and adopted Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission master plans in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties.On August 31, 2005, the Board of Public Works gave its approval to the Corridor 1 alternative, which allowed state funding of the project  in accordance with Maryland's provisions (established by statute) for funding a "growth-related project" that is not entirely within Priority Funding Areas.  In December 2005, controversy arose over the ICC's proposed toll rate. At a proposed 17 cents per mile, an end-to-end driver would have to pay about $6 a day for a round-trip (about $1,500 per year).  On May 30, 2006, the Federal Highway Administration gave approval to the Corridor 1 plan, meaning that Maryland had satisfied "all environmental, economic and community requirements and that it can build the highway".  The Baltimore Business Journal wrote, "Federal approval for the $2.4 billion connector came after Ehrlich made a direct request to President George W. Bush, who named the ICC as one of his priority projects. The president's direct attention prompted federal resource agencies to give the project a more timely environmental review."  Construction The SHA constructed the ICC using separate design-build contracts for five phases.   A. I-270/I-370 to east of MD 97 (completed) B. East of MD 97 to west of US 29 (completed) C. West of US 29 to east of I-95 interchange, and I-95 collector/distributor road improvements along I-95 from MD 212 to just north of the ICC (completed) D. Collector/distributor road improvements along I-95 from just north of the ICC to north of MD 198 (construction in progress) E. East of I-95 interchange to US 1 (construction to begin in January 2012)  The first of the five contracts was awarded on March 27, 2007. The contract, worth $478.7M, was awarded to Intercounty Constructors, a joint venture of Granite Construction Company, Corman Construction Inc. and G.A. & F.C. Wagman, Inc. Construction on the seven-mile (11 km) section between I-370 and MD 97 began in November 2007.    Contracts for three other phases are active and the fifth phase involving collector-distributor lanes along I-95 has been deferred. Requests for statements of qualification were issued for Phase A in December 2005,  for Phase D in August 2006,  and for Phase B in August 2007. The selection of the second of the five contracts was announced on November 20, 2007. The contract, worth $513.9M, was awarded to IC3, a joint venture of Shirley Contracting Company, LLC; Clark Construction Group, LLC; Guy F. Atkinson Construction, LLC; Facchina Construction Company, Inc. and Trumbull Corporation. This work includes the ICC from a point west of US 29 to I-95, and interchanges with those routes. On September 4, 2008, The Washington Post reported that the Contract B construction contract had been awarded on July 22, 2008 to a joint venture of Kiewit, Corman Construction, and G.A. & F.C. Wagman, at a total cost of about $559.7 million—reportedly 22% higher than previous estimates. The Post story went on to say that protest of this contract award was filed on July 30, 2008 by a joint venture that was not selected, though the bid price from the rejected group was lower. This protest may delay the start of construction on Contract B.  On October 15, 2008, the Post reported that the protest was denied by state procurement officer Robert P. Gay and that the losing proposer will file an appeal with the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals. On September 12, 2008, the Post reported that Contract D ran into funding issues which will delay its construction.  Contract D is associated with the proposed new interchange of I-95 and Contee Road (not part of the ICC). SHA Administrator Neil J. Pedersen stated that the "service roads can be delayed until the I-95 interchange has been built at Contee Road."The first segment opened on February 23, 2011,  ahead of its projected spring 2011 opening.    No tolls were charged on the date of opening to March 6, 2011.  On the opening morning, over 10,000 vehicles used the highway,    and it went on to draw in 30,000 vehicles per day. During the first week of May, the tollway drew 11,490 vehicles per day, which is much less than the 21,000 projected. As a result, the state is launching a $1.4 million advertising campaign to promote the new highway.  The second segment of the highway, from MD 97 to I-95 opened on November 22, 2011.     The highway is expected to be extended to US 1 as late as 2014.  FundingThe $2.56 billion project is being financed from several sources, including the Maryland Transportation Authority (MdTA) revenue bonds, $1,232,500,000 (50.39%), GARVEE bonds $750,000,000 (30.66%), Maryland General Fund $264,910,000 (10.83%), Maryland Transportation Trust Fund $180,000,000 (7.36%), and Special Federal Funds $18,500,000 (0.76%)   OppositionMD 200 has gained opposition from several groups, including the Maryland General Assembly and the Prince George's County Council. Proponents of the highway have claimed that it will improve the flow of interregional traffic, relieving traffic congestion on local roads. Opponents of the highway have claimed that the road will (with a few limited exceptions) harm significant traffic flow characteristics (such as increasing drive times, congestion, and costs in the form of tolls), will harm the environment (with air, sea and land impacts), and will disrupt established communities through which it passes.  Many of these assertions against the ICC were rebutted in detail in an appendix of the ICC's Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). Members of the Maryland General Assembly stated opposition in the Spring 2008  and Spring 2009 sessions, the 1998 session,  and back to 1979, when a bill introduced in the General Assembly by Delegate Robin Ficker proposed to eliminate funding for a study of the ICC and the never-built Rockville Facility highway project.  In 1980, a bill proposed by Delegate Idamae Garrott to forbid the Maryland Department of Transportation from even studying the matter of new highways running east and west between Montgomery and Prince George's Counties was tabled by the Montgomery County Delegation. In the 1998 session, House Bill 817 was introduced to prohibit MDOT from spending funds or granting approvals to the ICC project, and House Bill 905 was intended to stop the operation of a toll highway altogether.       Both bills failed to pass. In 2004, House Bill 732 proposed a similar statement to House Bill 817, extended to include the MdTA.    The 2007 Special Session saw the offering of House Bill 37 to prevent construction of the road. Both of these bills also failed to pass.    In the 2008 session, two bills proposing to cancel or delay the project were introduced – House Bill 1416 and House Bill 1471.       House Bill 1471 proposed to eliminate funding for the road, and, if it had passed, would trigger "liquidated damage clauses that would require it to pay the contractors an estimated $80.0 million upon cancellation of the contracts," according to the Fiscal Note prepared by the state's Department of Legislative Services.  Both bills failed.In the 2009 session, a bill proposing to cancel funding for the ICC was pre-filed by Delegate Barbara A. Frush – House Bill 27.    This bill had not attracted any co-sponsors nor had it been scheduled for a hearing.  A similar bill, Senate Bill 753, was filed in the Maryland Senate by Sen. E. J. Pipkin and others.  The Maryland Politics Watch blog opined that Pipkin's co-sponsorship of SB 753 may be related to his possible desire to run again for the U.S. House of Representatives Maryland District 1 seat.  Both bills failed in the 2009 session. House Bill 27 received an unfavorable report from the House of Delegates Appropriations Committee on March 28, 2009; and no action was taken on Senate Bill 753 prior to adjournment on April 13, 2009, though a hearing was scheduled on March 18, 2009 before the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee.The position of the County Council of Prince George's County in opposition to the ICC has been repeatedly cited by opposition groups, and its 2003 resolution on the subject, CR-32-2003, was adopted on June 10, 2003, where it called for alternatives to the road.  In 2007, the Prince George's County Council passed resolution CR-59-2007,  which repeats much of what was stated in CR-32-2003, including the language endorsing the ICC in Prince George's County.In November 2006, environmental groups announced that they were preparing to file suit in order to delay or stop the project,  and lawsuits aimed at halting construction   were filed by environmental groups and affected residents, assisted in part by pro bono legal counsel from the Institute for Public Representation of the Georgetown University Law Center.   One of those lawsuits was originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (possibly as part of a forum shopping effort to avoid having the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals hear the case on appeal  - though the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which would have heard any appeals from the D.C. federal court, had ruled against the Sierra Club and allied groups  on similar legal issues in reversing a lower court on a case involving the proposal to reconstruct and widen the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in 1999)  but Judge Gladys Kessler of the D.C. federal court ordered the matter transferred to federal court in Maryland on May 17, 2007 and the suits were consolidated. After hearings in October 2007,  both lawsuits were dismissed in their entirety on November 8, 2007 by Judge Alexander Williams, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland in a 105-page memorandum opinion.        The Baltimore Sun described the decision handed down by the court as a "victory for both Governor Martin O'Malley, who backs construction of the road, and a measure of vindication for former Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, who made it the top transportation priority of his administration."  After the opinion was released, environmental groups opposed to the ICC stated that they would "consider their legal options before deciding whether to continue their battle"  and some homeowners near the selected route expressed disagreement with the ruling of the court.  On January 7, 2008, it was announced that Environmental Defense and the Sierra Club would appeal Judge Williams' decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia.      In April 2008, persons and groups opposed to the ICC held an "Irish wake" to draw attention to the impact of the ICC,   and an op-ed in The Diamondback was printed which raised objections to the ICC. In June 2008, protests against the ICC were held at Dr. Charles R. Drew Elementary School in Silver Spring. The participants claimed that ICC construction should be halted because of air pollution impacts on pupils at the school, though it was reported that Governor O'Malley has no plans to do so.  In August 2008, The Baltimore Sun published a letter to the editor from the executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth calling on the Maryland Department of Transportation to "cancel the ICC."  In September 2008, The Sun's columnist Dan Rodricks wrote an anti-ICC opinion piece  asserting that the ICC was the "Intercounty Anachronism". Rodricks' column was first rebutted by a letter to the editor by Montgomery County Councilmember Nancy Floreen (D-At Large)  and then in a longer op-ed by SHA Administrator Neil Pedersen.  Also in September 2008, The Gazette published an op-ed by state delegate Heather R. Mizeur (D-District 20) suggesting that the ICC be canceled.  The Mizeur op-ed was rebutted in a response (also published by The Gazette) by Neil Pedersen in October 2008. In November 2008, it was announced that Environmental Defense had dropped its appeal with the Fourth Circuit of the decision handed down by Judge Williams of the U.S. District Court for Maryland about a year earlier. In exchange for dropping the suit, the State Highway Administration agreed to fund new emissions-reduction technology used by public school buses in Montgomery County; and the SHA will also "sponsor a three-year study that involves installing air quality monitors along a major highway selected for its similar characteristics to the ICC and I-95."   Press releases were issued by the State Highway Administration  and Environmental Defense  discussing the details of the legal settlement. Environmental mitigation  A major component of the ICC is environmental mitigation.  In addition to work taking place near and in the right-of-way of the ICC, there are over 50 "off-site environmental and community improvement projects" that will be funded as part of the ICC engineering and construction budget.  In a letter to the editor of The Baltimore Sun, David Marks, a former official with the Maryland Department of Transportation, wrote that the SHA project team "...had the foresight to require substantial environmental improvements as part of the project, and they insisted on broad public input..." One component of the mitigation is the replacement of parkland taken for the ICC with new land.  Replacement lands intended to compensate for these losses include a large parcel of land in the Boyds area of Montgomery County owned by the Eugene B. Casey Foundation. However, the trustees of the Casey Foundation did not agree to the purchase of this parcel,  so the State Highway Administration acquired the land by condemnation and the matter was reported as resolved in June 2008.  In July 2008, controversy was reported on a similar subject. A   parcel of land near the intersection of MD 198 and Peach Orchard Road which had been condemned by the SHA in 1997 for possible use as the so-called Northern Alignment (Corridor 2) was conveyed to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission to compensate for parkland which will be taken by the ICC. The former owner, Winchester Homes, filed a lawsuit contending that the SHA must offer to sell this land back to Winchester, and in May 2008, Judge S. Michael Pincus of the Montgomery County Circuit Court ruled that "the SHA was contractually obligated to offer Winchester Homes the chance to buy back the property." It was further reported that the state filed an appeal in June 2008. In the February 2008 edition of the Successes in Stewardship newsletter, the Federal Highway Administration stated:    Since environmental impacts were the major barrier to prior ICC planning efforts, the third EIS team redefined the project-development approach to explicitly include environmental stewardship as part of the project's stated purpose and need. In order to fulfill the ICC's stated purpose "to help restore the natural, human, and cultural environments in the project area from the adverse effects of past development," lead-agency staff used context-sensitive design approaches to minimize or altogether avoid adverse impacts to wetlands and streams in the development of project alternatives. At least one section of the ICC was re-routed from the master-planned route to reduce environmental impact, though the re-routing led to additional residences having to be condemned as a result. Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) in the path of the ICC will be located with the aid of dogs trained to find them by scent  and moved to other locations in Montgomery County near Boyds and Brookeville. In a letter to the editor of The Gazette, SHA Administrator Neil Pedersen enumerated a list of environmental mitigation and community enhancements that SHA is funding as part of constructing the ICC. The ICC is likely to force changes to the 14th hole of the Cross Creek Golf Club, which straddles the border between Montgomery County and Prince George's County. However, it was reported that the 14th hole was surveyed incorrectly, and part of it was mistakenly located on land set aside for the ICC. In January 2009, it was reported that Eyes of Paint Branch (a group that has opposed the ICC ) had recently demanded of the SHA that the contractors working to build the ICC comply with Montgomery County's regulations for the Upper Paint Branch Special Protection Area, which the State of Maryland has no legal obligation to follow.   Construction of the ICC has forced the National Capital Trolley Museum to relocate its car barns, shops, visitors center, and part of its track a short distance to the north. In 2006, the museum's development director made a public plea for relocation help and coordination in a Washington Post op-ed column.  The museum suspended operations for relocation in December 2008 and resumed trolley rides in January 2010.  In August 2009, the SHA held a public forum at the new and relocated trolley museum to describe the environmental mitigation aspects of the ongoing ICC construction project.   A major environmental concern along the entire ICC project is the impact of stormwater runoff on creeks and streams, during and after construction. Techniques and technologies to treat such water are known as best management practices (BMPs). State-of-the-art BMPs used along the ICC's construction project were described in an article in Land and Water magazine.  Some of the methods being used to control runoff were described in a The Baltimore Sun "On the Outdoors" column, published after the writer toured several work areas along the ICC's right-of-way: The ICC project employs teams of "stormbusters" to put down straw and grass seed and erect plastic silt fences in construction areas before it rains to prevent erosion. Solar-powered stream monitors give Baker and enforcement personnel a real-time reading of water conditions. Paved storm-water ditches in older neighborhoods abutting the highway will be replaced by grass-lined swales that will filter and cool the water before it enters tributaries. The Sun column went on to describe financial incentives that will be paid to construction contractors that meet environmental goals and requirements. As part of construction work, several archaeological sites have been found in the path of the ICC, including a Native American site near Georgia Avenue and Norbeck Road that contains artifacts dating to the Stone Age.  and near US 29, the 19th century homestead of a freed slave, Melinda Jackson, containing numerous artifacts.  Associated construction projects  Bicycle trailA bicycle trail has long been planned to run parallel to the highway,  both in Montgomery County  and Prince George's County.   However, in 2004, the SHA announced that it was dropping the ICC bike trail from its own plans due to cost and environmental footprint.  Since then, there have been proposals to re-route some sections of the trail over existing surface streets,  and to cut back or eliminate the trail for reasons of environmental impact  and cost. This move was harshly criticized by several groups, notably the bicycling community, who as The Washington Post states "have been promised much and given little" pertaining to the bicycle trail; however, it also believes that the county planners are assessing the situation seriously and will make the best decision.    Eventually, on September 18, 2008, the Montgomery County Planning Board voted to endorse a trail following a route not adjacent to the ICC's route. The Planning Board's proposal has been submitted to the Montgomery County Council for consideration as a master plan amendment. Bicycle advocates have stated their opposition to the proposal to remove parts of the bike trail immediately adjacent to the ICC.  Later, in March 2009, the Montgomery County Council effectively endorsed both approaches, one being a route that did not follow the ICC (in particular, along the route crossing the Paint Branch) but also keeping in place plans for a path essentially parallel to the highway. The first section of the bike path, from Needwood Road to MD 28 (Norbeck Road), primarily following the MD 200 right-of-way except for a section which follows Emory Lane to Georgia Avenue, opened on July 30, 2011.

Maryland Route 45      Maryland Route 45 (MD 45) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as York Road, the state highway runs   from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Baltimore north to the Pennsylvania state line in Maryland Line, where the highway continues as SR 3001.  MD 45 is the primary highway between Downtown Baltimore and Towson, the county seat of Baltimore County.  North of Interstate 695, the state highway parallels I-83 and serves the suburban communities of Lutherville, Timonium, Cockeysville, and Hunt Valley.  MD 45 also connects the northern Baltimore County communities of Hereford and Parkton.  The state highway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration in Baltimore County and by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation in the city, where the highway also follows Greenmount Avenue.York Road, which follows the path of an 18th century wagon road and 19th century turnpike, was one of the original state roads marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909.  The state highway was constructed as an all-weather road in the mid-1910s from Baltimore to Hereford.  The remainder of York Road to Maryland Line was built in the late 1910s and early 1920s.  York Road was designated US 111 in 1927 and widened to handle the increasing traffic load in the late 1920s.  York Road became a secondary route when a freeway was constructed from Baltimore to York and Harrisburg in the 1950s.  US 111 was moved to this freeway as sections opened; the old road became MD 45.  MD 45 fully replaced US 111 on York Road when the U.S. Highway was replaced by I-83 in the early 1960s. Route descriptionMD 45 begins at an intersection with US 1 (North Avenue) at the northwest corner of Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.  Greenmount Avenue continues south as a city street to Forrest Street and Monument Street east of Downtown Baltimore.  MD 45 heads north as a four-lane undivided street between the Barclay and East Baltimore Midway neighborhoods and crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision.  The state highway continues north through Waverly, where the street passes St. John's Episcopal Church and intersects 33rd Street.  MD 45 is paralleled to the east by Old York Road through Waverly and Pen Lucy.  At 43rd Street, MD 45's name changes to York Road.  The name change occurs where the highway exited the city limits of Baltimore between 1888 and 1917.   MD 45 continues north as a five-lane road with center turn lane.  Between Cold Spring Lane and Northern Parkway, the state highway passes through Mid-Govans, which is home to the Senator Theater.  MD 45 leaves the city limits and passes through the Baltimore County community of Rodgers Forge.  The state highway passes along the eastern margin of Towson University before reaching the southern edge of downtown Towson, where MD 45 Bypass splits to the northwest along Burke Avenue.  In the center of the county seat adjacent to Towson Town Center, MD 45 passes through the racetrack-shaped Towson Roundabout, where the state highway meets the southern end of MD 146 (Dulaney Valley Road) and east–west Joppa Road.  On either side of the roundabout, the state highway narrows to two lanes for on-street parking.  MD 45 heads northwest from the roundabout and meets the northern end of MD 45 Bypass (Bosley Avenue) and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway).  The state highway continues north through the densely-populated suburban area of Lutherville where the highway intersects Seminary Road, which heads west as MD 131.  The west side of MD 45 is lined with commercial and industrial parks as it passes through Timonium.  Between Timonium Road and Padonia Road, both of which head west to interchanges with I-83, the state highway passes along the edge of the Timonium Fairgrounds, home of the Maryland State Fair.  The industrial parks continue past Warren Road in Cockeysville, where the highway crosses Beaver Dam Run.  MD 45 meets the western end of MD 145 (Ashland Road) before arriving in Hunt Valley, where the highway intersects Shawan Road at Hunt Valley Town Center.  North of Shawan Road, MD 45 becomes a two-lane road that crosses Western Run and curves northeast before resuming its northward course through the community of Sparks, where the highway has an intersection with Belfast Road and passes several industrial parks.  The state highway continues through the village of Hereford, which contains the western terminus of MD 138 (Monkton Road) and the eastern terminus of MD 137 (Mount Carmel Road) one block apart.  North of Hereford, MD 45 descends into the valley of Gunpowder Falls, where the highway closely parallels I-83.  The two highways separate, with the state highway passing by the Half-Way House, a preserved toll house from the 19th century turnpike that is halfway between Baltimore and York.  In Parkton, MD 45 intersects Middletown Road and passes over the Northern Central Railroad Trail and Little Gunpowder Falls.  North of the village, the state highway crosses to the west side of I-83 at a diamond interchange with the Interstate.  The state highway intersects MD 439 (Old York Road) and Freeland Road in the community of Maryland Line before reaching its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line.  The roadway continues north as SR 3001 (Susquehanna Trail) toward the borough of Shrewsbury.   HistoryYork Road was first constructed as a wagon road in the early 1740s to connect the new settlement of York with the port of Baltimore.   In the 19th century, this road became part of the Baltimore and Yorktown Turnpike.    When the Maryland State Roads Commission put together a state road system in 1909, York Road from North Avenue in Baltimore to Parkton was designated one of the original state roads to be improved.   The first section of the old turnpike to be resurfaced with a   wide macadam surface was from Washington Avenue just north of the center of Towson and the hamlet of Texas south of Cockeysville in 1913.  The highway from the contemporary northern city limit of Baltimore near 42nd Street to Washington Avenue just north of the center of Towson was surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1914.  York Road from Texas to Glencoe was resurfaced in 1914 and from there to the hamlet of Verona south of Hereford in 1915.   The improved macadam road was extended to Parkton by 1919.   York Road from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line was paved in concrete in two sections completed in 1921 and 1923.    Greenmount Avenue was reconstructed from 42nd Street to its southern end by 1924.    In 1927, York Road and Greenmount Avenue north of North Avenue became part of US 111. Early improvements to York Road included the construction of new bridges over Western Run and Gunpowder Falls in 1918 and 1924; these bridges remain in use.     Other bridges included grade separations at the crossings of the Northern Central Railway at Cockeysville and Parkton built around 1930.   US 111 was widened with concrete shoulders in much of Baltimore County in the mid- to late 1920s.   York Road and Greenmount Avenue were widened and reconstructed in Baltimore in 1929 and 1930.  By 1930, US 111 had a width of   from inside Baltimore to Towson,   from Towson to Parkton, and   from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line.   By 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended widening the U.S. Highway to   from Towson to Cockeysville and to   from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line.   The latter stretch was widened to   in 1946 and 1947. Further widening of US 111 was not planned because York Road was to be bypassed by a freeway between Baltimore and Harrisburg.  Construction on the Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway got underway in 1948 between Timonium and Hunt Valley.   The first portion of the freeway opened from Towson to Belfast Road north of Hunt Valley in December 1955, concurrent with the opening of the portion of the Baltimore Beltway between Falls Road and York Road.   US 111 was moved to the freeway when the Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway was completed to north of Hereford in 1957; MD 45 was assigned to York Road between the Beltway and the northern end of the freeway.    A second, disjoint portion of MD 45 was assigned from north of Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line when the Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway was completed between Parkton and the York area in 1959.    When the final section of the US 111 freeway was completed between Hereford and Parkton in 1960, MD 45 was assigned to the stretch of York Road between those communities.    US 111 and I-83 were co-signed on the freeway between Towson and Harrisburg until US 111 was decommissioned in 1963; the MD 45 designation was extended south into Baltimore to US 1 at that time.   Junction list                                Related routes Towson bypass route  Maryland Route 45 Bypass (MD 45 Bypass) is a county-maintained, signed bypass route of MD 45 in Towson.  The four- to six-lane divided highway runs   along the west side of downtown Towson.  MD 45 Bypass begins south of downtown at MD 45's intersection with Burke Avenue.  At Towsontown Boulevard on the north edge of the Towson University campus, the bypass route curves north and its name changes to Bosley Avenue.  MD 45 Bypass follows Bosley Avenue north past Joppa Road to MD 45 north of the Towson Roundabout.  Bosley Avenue continues northeast beyond MD 45 to Fairmount Avenue.    Auxiliary routesMD 45 has five unsigned auxiliary routes.  MD 45A is in Towson; MD 45B through MD 45E are in Cockeysville.  MD 45A is the designation for the   section of West Road between MD 45 and a pair of ramps to and from eastbound I-695.   MD 45B is the designation for the   segment of Cockeysville Road immediately west of MD 45.   MD 45C is the designation for the   section of Railroad Avenue immediately west of MD 45.  MD 45D is the designation for the   segment of Sherwood Road between MD 45 and Cedar Knoll Road.   MD 45E is the designation for the   section of Beaver Run Lane immediately east of MD 45.

River Hill, Columbia, Maryland River Hill is the last "River Hill Community Association", riverhill.columbiavillages.org, accessed May 29, 2009  and westernmost village to be developed in the town of Columbia, Maryland, though numerous residents have addresses in Clarksville. Construction started in 1990. Marx, Paul.   It is bounded by Maryland Route 108 and Maryland Route 32, and is centered on Trotter Road.   The village is divided into two neighborhoods: Pheasant Ridge and Pointers Run,  with about 6,500 residents. The original plan called for the village to be connected to the rest of Columbia via an extension of Little Patuxent Parkway. In addition, a dam on the Middle Patuxent River would have created a large lake in that watershed. However, with the rise of the environmental movement, a large part of the watershed was made into a park. with about half of its acreage devoted to open space, which includes the   of the Middle Patuxent Environmental Area.   River Hill is largely disconnected from the rest of the city, accessing Columbia Town Center only by roads on the periphery of the city.The original plan called for   to be devoted to apartments, but the rural neighbors wanted a lower population density. The county zoning board decided upon   for apartments. Consequently, River Hill has the most open space of all the villages.  Names The street names come from the works of Walt Whitman and James Whitcomb Riley.   Services The village center includes a Giant Food, McDonald's, Ruby Tuesday, Bagel Bin and Deli, Ledo Pizza, Subway, The UPS Store, Chevy Chase Bank, a liquor store, a dry cleaner, an optometrist, the River Hill grill restaurant, a Hair Cuttery, and a Red Mango.  An athletic club (The Columbia Gym) is located near the village center.   There is one outdoor pool in the village.

Kings Contrivance, Columbia, Maryland Kings Contrivance is one of the 10 villages in the planned community of Columbia, Maryland, and is home to about 11,000 residents. It was first occupied in 1977. "Kings Contrivance", kingscontrivance.columbiavillages.org, accessed May 29, 2009  It is Columbia's southernmost village  and includes a Village Center (open-air shopping center) and many apartment complexes and housing developments. The village takes its name from the restaurant of the same name, which in turn was named for the boyhood home of Howard County Circuit Court Judge James Macgill.   It is neither the least nor most expensive village in Columbia. The three neighborhoods are:  Huntington is located to the Southeast of the village center, and is named for an historic home. Mitchell, Joseph Rocco and Stebenne, David. New City Upon a Hill: A History of Columbia, Maryland (2007), The History Press, ISBN 1-59629-067-6, p. 129   Macgill's Common extends to the northwest towards the center of Columbia, and takes its name from the Reverend James Macgill, the original owner of the land in a land grant dated 1830. Dickinson, to the west, takes its name from the famous American poet, Emily Dickinson.   The street names of Huntington are derived from the works of Carl Sandburg, and those of Macgill's Common come from the Folksongs of North America compilation recorded by Alan Lomax. Dickinson, naturally, has street names taken from the work of Emily Dickinson. There are many scenic and recreational parks in and around Kings Contrivance, including Gorman Park, Huntington Neighborhood Park, and Savage Park, all of which are maintained by Howard County Recreation and Parks and the Columbia Association.   Many trails weave in and around the neighborhoods of Kings Contrivance, providing access to the county parks, as well as to Columbia's extensive bike/hiking trail system. ServicesThe Village Center, opened in 1986,  contains a Bagel Bin & Deli, a McDonald's, a Chinese restaurant, an Italian diner called Trattoria E Pizzeria de Enrico, a Subway restaurant, a liquor store, a CVS, several ATMs, a beauty salon, a barber, a dry cleaner, a formal wear shop, office space, medical offices, an Allstate Insurance agency, a gas station, and a cobbler.  A Harris Teeter grocery store, the second in Maryland, opened in May 2008, on the site of a Safeway that closed in 2006. A Rita's Italian ice store was also added in 2008.Amherst House, the location of the Kings Contrivance Community Association, is also in the village center. This building, named after Emily Dickinson's hometown in Massachusetts, also serves as a rental hall for community events, parties, and meetings.

Interstate 370 (Maryland) 
Interstate 195 (Maryland)    Interstate 195 (I-195) is an Interstate highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs   from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport) in Linthicum north to I-95 in Arbutus, where Metropolitan Boulevard continues north as Maryland Route 166 (MD 166). I-195, which is also known as Metropolitan Boulevard, is the main connection between the airport terminal and highways leading to Baltimore, Washington, and Annapolis, including I-95, MD 295, and I-97. The Interstate highway also has an interchange with MD 170, which forms part of the Airport Loop that provides access to various airport-related services. I-195 also links I-95 with Catonsville and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), via MD 166. The Interstate is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length. I-195 was constructed in three sections. The first section was a connection between MD 295 and the airport. This segment was built as Maryland Route 46 and completed in 1951 shortly after the opening of the airport, which was originally named Friendship International Airport. The second segment was completed at the opposite end of the highway in the mid-1970s, connecting U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and I-95 with MD 166 and UMBC. The first two segments were connected when the portion between MD 295 and US 1 was constructed in the late 1980s. The whole length of the highway was completed and was marked as I-195 in 1990. Route description I-195 begins at the entrance to BWI Airport. The eastbound roadway continues southeast into the airport proper, where it features a left exit for the hourly parking garage and then splits into two roadways for arriving and departing flights. After the two roadways—arriving flights on the lower level and departing flights on the upper level—loop between the terminal and the hourly parking garage, the roadways merge. The westbound direction of I-195 heads northwest from the airport after it issues a ramp toward long-term parking and a U-turn toward the terminal. I-195 heads northwest as a four-lane freeway, with a speed limit of   between the airport and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 170 (Aviation Boulevard), also known as the Airport Loop. The Airport Loop provides access to long-term parking lots, the consolidated rental car facility, hotels, cargo and general aviation facilities, and the BWI Rail Station. The circumferential highway also provides indirect access to I-97 for traffic heading to Annapolis or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  I-195's speed limit increases to   between the overpass for the BWI Trail and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway), which contains a flyover ramp from southbound MD 295 to southbound I-195.  The Interstate parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line before elevating onto a viaduct to cross the railroad tracks and the Patapsco River, where the freeway passes from Anne Arundel County to Baltimore County. I-195 crosses over I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) with no access before its four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with US 1 (Washington Boulevard). The highway continues northwest over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and meets I-95 at a partial cloverleaf interchange   southwest of the I-95–I-695 junction; the interchange features flyovers from northbound I-95 to northbound I-195 and from southbound I-95 to southbound I-195. The highway officially ends at the northern edge of the interchange. The speed limit drops to   as the freeway continues as MD 166 under the Selford Road overpass. The highway has a partial interchange for UMBC Boulevard, which leads to the UMBC campus, before ending next to a park and ride facility at Rolling Road, on which MD 166 continues north toward Catonsville.   HistoryFriendship International Airport was constructed between 1947 and 1950 as the new primary airport for Baltimore.  To directly connect the airport with Baltimore, an access road was planned to link the new Baltimore–Washington Expressway, later designated MD 295, with the airport terminal. The first portion of the Friendship International Airport Access Road was completed from a full Y interchange at the expressway to an interchange with MD 170 in October 1949 and designated MD 46.     The access road was completed from MD 170 to the airport terminal in July 1951, about the same time the expressway was completed between MD 46 and downtown Baltimore.   The remainder of what is now I-195 was planned as early as 1969, when the portion of Metropolitan Boulevard north of US 1 was placed under construction.   The freeway opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I-95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern Selford Road overpass in August 1974.   The freeway was extended to its present terminus at Rolling Road and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975.   Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I-95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46 from when it opened. North of I-95, the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166.  That segment of MD 46 was renumbered as an extension of MD 166 by 1981. The missing connection between US 1 and MD 295 resulted in a circuitous path for traffic between I-95 and BWI Airport. In 1974, that route involved exiting I-95 at MD 100, which then served as a connector between the Interstate and US 1. Traffic took US 1 south to MD 176, then took MD 176 east to MD 295 and north to the western end of MD 46.  Construction on the missing link, which by then was planned as part of I-195, began in 1987, when the highway's bridges over US 1 and I-895 were constructed.    The remainder of the highway from MD 295 to the I-895 overpass was completed, including reconstruction of the interchange with MD 295, and the intermediate section opened in June 1990.   The I-195 designation was applied to the highway's present length at the same time, and MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus.  In 2002, as part of an expansion project at the airport, several new ramps were constructed to access parking lots and facilitate an easier U-turn for motorists leaving the terminal who wish to return to the terminal.

Interstate 395 (Maryland)  Interstate 395 (I-395) is an Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as Cal Ripken Way, the highway runs   from I-95 north to Howard Street and Camden Street in Baltimore.  I-395 is a spur that heads north from I-95 over the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River toward Downtown Baltimore, where it provides access to the Inner Harbor and the Baltimore Convention Center.  The Interstate also serves the Camden Yards Sports Complex, which contains M&T Bank Stadium and Oriole Park at Camden Yards, homes of the Baltimore Ravens and Baltimore Orioles, respectively.  I-395 also serves as the southern terminus of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, an urban arterial that provides a western bypass of downtown Baltimore and connects I-95 with U.S. Route 40, US 1, and I-83. The Interstate is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MdTA) and, like all Interstates, is a part of the National Highway System.  Route descriptionI-395 begins at a directional T interchange with I-95 that is entirely elevated above the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River, an estuary that receives Gwynns Falls just west of the interchange.  The two-lane ramps from northbound I-95 to northbound I-395 and southbound I-395 to southbound I-95 pass over ramps from southbound I-95 to the southbound Baltimore-Washington Parkway and from the northbound parkway to northbound I-95.  The one-lane ramp from southbound I-395 to northbound I-95 splits from the southbound I-95 ramp where the Interstate becomes a viaduct over land.  I-395, which carries six lanes, passes to the west of the Federal Hill neighborhood and to the east of M&T Bank Stadium and begins to parallel the Baltimore Light Rail and CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision, which carries MARC's Camden Line.   East of the stadium, two-lane flyover ramps from northbound I-395 to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and from the boulevard to southbound I-395 leave and join the mainline.  I-395 curves to due north as a four-lane freeway that gains one additional lane in each direction as the viaduct ends and the highway approaches its signed, limited access terminus at Conway Street adjacent to Camden Station, the northern terminus of the Camden Line.  The train station is just to the east of the B&O Warehouse, which is just to the east of Oriole Park at Camden Yards.  Conway Street heads east toward Light Street and the Inner Harbor.  I-395 officially continues one block north along the western edge of the Baltimore Convention Center to a northern terminus at Camden Street adjacent to the Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards, which is in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's original Camden Station building.  The roadway continues north as Howard Street through downtown Baltimore.   HistoryIn 1969, the Design Concept Team, a multi-discipline group assembled in 1966 by the city government to help design freeway routings that would not disrupt the city's fabric, published the Baltimore 3-A Interstate and Boulevard System. In the 3-A system, I-395 was planned as a freeway spur from I-95 to the south edge of the central business district, connecting to a new route named City Boulevard (now known as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). As routed in the 3-A System, I-95 would act as a bypass of the central business district, with I-395 providing direct access. Kozel, Scott. Roads to the Future: Baltimore Early Expressway Planning URL accessed 17:55, 5 February 2007.  On May 30, 2008, the Eastern Branch  was officially dedicated for Cal Ripken, Jr., the Hall of Fame baseball player who played for the Baltimore Orioles from 1981 to 2001 and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.  The Eastern Branch is now called Cal Ripken Way from I-95 to Conway Street.  Exit list              Related route Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard is a   controlled-access boulevard that passes along the west side of downtown Baltimore. The boulevard begins at a partial interchange with I-395 south of downtown and ends at Howard Street and Chase Street north of downtown. The first   of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, from I-395 to Russell Street, is unsigned I-395A and is maintained by MdTA.  The remainder of the highway from Russell Street to Howard Street is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation. The boulevard is a part of the National Highway System between I-395 and US 40. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard begins as a pair of two-lane freeway ramps to and from southbound I-395 and northbound I-395, respectively. Before the northbound ramp crosses I-395, an exit ramp splits from the main flyover for Lee Street, which leads to Russell Street and parking for M&T Bank Stadium and Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The boulevard curves to the west, crosses over the Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and Baltimore Light Rail lines, and passes between the two stadiums. Each direction of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard receives a ramp from northbound Russell Street before it crosses over the state highway. At the west end of the bridge over Russell Street, maintenance changes from state to city. The boulevard curves northwest and the southbound direction has an exit ramp for southbound Russell Street before the freeway section ends at a signalized intersection with Washington Boulevard.  Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard continues as a six-lane controlled-access boulevard. The boulevard passes between the Pigtown neighborhood to the west and Ridgely's Delight on the east. The highway veers north at Lombard Street and passes along Old Saint Paul's Cemetery, which is adjacent to the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard has intersections with Franklin and Mulberry streets, which act as the ramps of a diamond interchange with a short freeway segment of US 40. North of US 40, the boulevard passes the Perkins Square Gazebo as it curves northeast. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard has intersections with Druid Hill Avenue and McCulloh Street, which form the southbound and northbound directions, respectively, of MD 129. The boulevard passes to the east of State Center, a collection of state office buildings, before intersecting Howard Street at the northern end of that street's integration with the Baltimore Light Rail. At Howard Street, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard splits into separate roadways that rejoin at their five-way intersection with Park Avenue, which is one-way northbound, and Chase Street, which is one-way westbound. The boulevard continues one more block to its official northern terminus next to the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall; this intersection's west leg is an east-heading disjoint segment of Park Street and its east leg is one-way eastbound Biddle Street. The Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard-initiated arterial route continues north along a four-lane undivided, two-block disjoint segment of Cathedral Street separate from the portion of Cathedral Street that complements Charles Street to the south. Cathedral Street reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with Mount Royal Avenue between the former Mount Royal Station of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad to the west and the Lyric Opera House to the east. One direction of Mount Royal Avenue, a four-lane boulevard, heads east through the University of Baltimore campus before paralleling I-83 to its eastern terminus at Guilford Street. The arterial follows Mount Royal Avenue northwest, intersects the light rail at-grade, crosses over Howard Street, and passes along the northeast side of the Bolton Hill neighborhood. Mount Royal Avenue reaches its western terminus at US 1 and US 40 Truck (North Avenue) at their interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway).

Interstate 495 (Maryland) 
Interstate 595 (Maryland)     Interstate 595 (I-595) is an unsigned number for a section of the John Hanson Highway (U.S. Route 50 [US 50] and U.S. Route 301) from I-495 (Capital Beltway) east of Washington, D.C., to Route 70 at Annapolis, Maryland.US 50 & I-595 have an high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV) in each direction from west of the Beltway to east of US 301, a distance of  . Unlike other HOV lanes in the Washington metropolitan area, which are only restricted during rush hours, the HOV lanes on I-595 are restricted at all times.   I-595 is the longest unsigned stretch of Interstate Highway in the entire Interstate system at   long. This Interstate was left unsigned because most motorists were already familiar with US 50 and US 301. Route descriptionThe existing US 50 freeway east from the Baltimore-Washington Parkway converts into I-595 within the Capital Beltway interchange. East of the interchange, I-595 is 10 lanes wide; beyond the Maryland Route 704 (MD 704) interchange, it narrows to eight lanes, with the innermost two being HOV lanes.The frequency of the interchanges decreases as the development backs away from the highway, and US 50 passes over or under several routes before interchanging with MD 197 near Bowie, using a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highway approaches a residential development as it soon after interchanges with the next major route: US 301 and MD 3. Within this interchange, US 301 joins the freeway, creating a three-route concurrency, and the highway exits development again, traveling through mostly woodland.Up to and slightly beyond the US 301/MD 3 interchange, the highway surface of I-595 is concrete. From there onwards, the highway is surfaced with asphalt composite. Within the US 301 interchange, the HOV lanes that began at the Capital Beltway come to an end.There is an interchange with MD 424 in the countryside after turning northwest once more, approaching Annapolis. Before this, however, US 50 has an interchange with the southern end of I-97. I-97 uses a directional-T interchange, but then, the two highways straddle US 50 as collector-distributor lanes, before passing over the highway with another partial interchange and going south into Annapolis as a direct freeway spur, now signed as MD 665.After the collector-distributor roads leave, the highway passes through the Annapolis urban area, and interchanges with MD 450. MD 450 is an older alignment of US 50, which runs parallel to the John Hanson Highway between Annapolis and Washington. Shortly after this, I-595 meets Medical Parkway and Solomons Island Road. Solomons Island Road adds one more highway to the concurrency: MS 2. The four-route concurrency of I-595, US 50, US 301, and MS 2 continues until the next interchange only about a mile later at MD 70. Here, the John Hanson Highway name ends, as does I-595. US 50, US 301, and MD 2 continue along the freeway routing, no longer a part of the Interstate Highway System. However, the physical roadbed was fully upgraded to Interstate Highway standards to the western edge of the Severn River Bridge.  HistoryThe John Hanson Highway, US 50's route between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis, was constructed in 1957, and ran from New York Avenue just outside Washington, D.C., to MD 2, the Ritchie Highway, north of Annapolis, connecting to the western approach to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The highway was four lanes throughout, and connected to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, I-495 and US 301 with full-cloverleaf interchanges.Due to the increasing use of the highway and the dangerous conditions at the interchanges with the Capital Beltway and US 301, the highway was reconstructed to Interstate standards between 1990 and 1995 between the Capital Beltway and MD 70 in Annapolis, using funding released from the cancellation of Interstate Highway segments within Baltimore. Originally, it was intended to designate the reconstructed highway as I-68, but with the completion of the National Freeway in far western Maryland in 1991, the Maryland State Highway Administration chose instead to designate that route as I-68, leaving the John Hanson Highway to be designated as I-595.  In the 1980s, the John Hanson Highway was planned to be designated as a part of I-97 between the Capital Beltway and the current I-97 interchange and as Interstate 197 between I-97 and MD 70.  Former proposed I-595In the early 1980s, the same route number was proposed for a connector in Baltimore from I-95 to what was then called I-170, which was left stranded from the rest of the Interstate Highway System by the cancellation of I-70 within the city limits of Baltimore. That connector was never built, and I-170 has been redesignated as part of US 40. Reasons for lack of signageIn January 2001, highway historian Scott Kozel contacted the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) to ask why I-595 was not signed. They responded with: "We did not feel that either the posting in the field or the noting on a map would serve any useful purpose for the traveling public". At times in 2011, the MDSHA has used the I-595 reference on the CHART website. This seems to be at the discretion of the operator at the time when referencing accidents and incidents on that highway. No official policy change has been mentioned regarding this. Exit listBecause I-595 is an unsigned route that is completely concurrent with US 50, the latter's exit numbers are used.

General Assembly of Maryland 
Interstate 270 (Maryland)  Interstate 270 (abbreviated I-270) is a   auxiliary Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Maryland that travels between Interstate 495 (the Capital Beltway) just north of Bethesda, Montgomery County and Interstate 70 in the city of Frederick in Frederick County. It consists of the   mainline as well as a   spur that provides access to and from southbound I-495. I-270 is known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Highway as well as the Washington National Pike. Most of the southern part of the route in Montgomery County passes through suburban areas around Rockville and Gaithersburg that are home to many biotech firms. This portion of I-270 is up to twelve lanes wide and consists of a local-express lane configuration as well as high-occupancy vehicle lanes that are in operation during peak travel times. North of the Gaithersburg area, the road continues through the northern part of Montgomery County, passing Germantown and Clarksburg as a six- to eight-lane highway with a HOV lane in the northbound direction only. North of here, I-270 continues through rural areas into Frederick County and toward the city of Frederick as a four-lane freeway.The freeway was built in 1953 as the Washington National Pike between Bethesda and Frederick and carried U.S. Route 240, which was rerouted off what is now Maryland Route 355 between these two points. With the creation of the Interstate Highway System a few years later, the road was designated as Interstate 70S along with US 240. There were plans to extend I-70S to Interstate 95 in Washington, D.C. on the North Central Freeway from the Capital Beltway; however, they were cancelled in the 1970s due to opposition from residents in the freeway’s path. By 1975, I-70S became I-270 and the US 240 designation was removed from the road. Increasing traffic levels led to a $200 million widening of the road in Montgomery County to its current configuration and further increased traffic. Many improvements are slated for I-270, including the construction of three new interchanges and the widening of the route between Shady Grove Road and Frederick that would add HOV and express toll lanes. Route description  Montgomery CountyInterstate 270 heads northwest from an interchange with Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway) and Maryland Route 355 (Rockville Pike) in suburban Bethesda, Montgomery County as a six-lane freeway with a   speed limit.     The left lane on each side is used as a high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane) in the northbound direction between 3:30 and 6:30 PM weekdays and in the southbound direction between 6:00 and 9:00 AM weekdays.   At the southern terminus, I-270 only has access to and from the eastbound direction of I-495.   The road turns west and comes to an interchange with Maryland Route 187 (Old Georgetown Road). From there, I-270 continues west as a ten-lane freeway and merges with Interstate 270 Spur, which provides access to and from southbound I-495. Past this interchange, I-270 continues north as a twelve-lane freeway with an HOV lane and five travel lanes in each direction. The route passes through wooded suburban areas, where prior to the cloverleaf interchange with Montrose Road (MD 927), I-270 takes on a local-express lane configuration with the outer two lanes serving as local lanes and the inner three lanes and the HOV lane serving as express lanes.   Past Montrose Road, I-270 continues north into the Rockville area, turning northwest before it comes to a single-point urban interchange with Maryland Route 189 (Falls Road), where the highway sees 253,620 vehicles daily.    The road continues to a modified cloverleaf interchange with Maryland Route 28 (Montgomery Avenue).  Past MD 28, the freeway passes numerous business parks and some wooded areas before coming to an interchange with Shady Grove Road.  Past this interchange, I-270 leaves Rockville and heads into Gaithersburg, where it intersects Interstate 370, a road that provides access to a park and ride lot at the Shady Grove Metro station.   This interchange provides access to Maryland Route 200 (the Intercounty Connector) and I-95 in Laurel. Past I-370, the local lane configuration ends in the southbound direction, which now has an HOV lane and four travel lanes while the northbound direction still has an HOV lane, three express lanes, and two local lanes.   I-270 continues past more suburban development before coming to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with Maryland Route 117 (West Diamond Avenue).   Past this interchange, the southbound HOV restrictions end and I-270 continues north with four travel lanes in the southbound direction and an HOV lane, three express lanes and two local lanes in the northbound direction before reaching Maryland Route 124 (Quince Orchard Road).    Past MD 124, the local lanes in the northbound direction ends, and I-270 head northwest as an eight-lane freeway with four southbound lanes and an HOV lane and three travel lanes northbound. It passes through wooded areas, leaving Gaithersburg, and comes to an interchange with Middlebrook Road.   The freeway narrows to six lanes again past at this interchange, with three lanes in each direction including a northbound HOV lane. I-270 continues into the Germantown area and interchanges with Maryland Route 118 (Germantown Road). A short distance later, after passing by some business parks, I-270 comes to an interchange with Maryland Route 27 (Ridge Road) and Father Hurley Boulevard.   Past MD 27, I-270 heads into more rural areas of woods with some farm fields, paralleled by a set of power lines.  The road interchanges with Maryland Route 121 (Clarksburg Road) in Clarksburg and the northbound HOV restriction ends past this interchange, with I-270 continuing north as a four-lane freeway with a   speed limit.  The power lines stop paralleling the route and it continues through more rural areas of woods and farms, running closely parallel to MD 355. The median widens, with trees in the middle, and I-270 has weigh stations on both sides.  The highway reaches Hyattstown, where it has an interchange with Maryland Route 109 (Old Hundred Road).   Frederick CountyA short distance past the MD 109 interchange, I-270 crosses into Frederick County, continuing northwest through rural woodland and farmland. It reaches the Urbana area, where the route has an interchange with Maryland Route 80 (Fingerboard Road).   The highway briefly runs along the east side of MD 80 past this interchange before continuing through agricultural areas. It features a scenic overlook in the northbound direction as the road passes through Monocacy National Battlefield, which was the site of the Battle of Monocacy Junction. I-270 eventually leaves the battlefield area and continues into the commercial outskirts of Frederick.  Here, the road interchanges with Maryland Route 85 (Buckeystown Pike) near the Francis Scott Key Mall. I-270 continues through commercial areas before coming to its northern terminus at an interchange with Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40 (Baltimore National Pike).   Past this interchange, the freeway continues north as the Frederick Freeway, a part of US 40 that interchanges with U.S. Route 15 and U.S. Route 340 a short distance north of I-270’s northern terminus.  HistoryIn 1947, plans were made to construct a freeway called the Washington National Pike parallel to U.S. Route 240 (present-day MD 355) between Bethesda and Frederick.    This road was completed in 1953, and the US 240 designation was moved to it. As a result, suburban growth began along the corridor between Washington, D.C. and Frederick, with several federal agencies including the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the National Bureau of Standards, and the National Institutes of Health moving their headquarters to Montgomery County.    Following the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, Interstate 70S was designated along with US 240 on the Washington National Pike. It was a suffixed  while the bypassed portion of the original US 240 north of the current interchange between I-495 and I-270 was designated as MD 355 by 1960.    A western spur that provided access to southbound I-495 was eventually built and became I-270.   I-70S was projected to continue past the Capital Beltway into Washington, D.C. on the North Central Freeway to connect directly to Interstate 95. Plans for this freeway initially began in 1959 when a freeway was called for along the Georgia Avenue corridor.     In the mid-1960s, a study was proposed for the freeway that recommended several different routings between Washington, D.C. and the Capital Beltway.      By 1966, a route for the North Central Freeway was planned along a Baltimore & Ohio Railroad line running through the northeastern part of Washington and Takoma Park north to the Capital Beltway.    In a 1971 study by DeLeuw, Cather Associates and Harry Wesse & Associates, LTD, I-70S was planned to run from its southern terminus at I-495 and run concurrent with that route before turning south on the North Central Freeway and ending at I-95 in Washington.  The routing of the freeway through residential areas of Washington drew opposition from residents of the Takoma Park, Brookland, and Michigan Park neighborhoods who were successful in getting the freeway cancelled through their neighborhoods in 1970.    The North Central Freeway within Maryland was cancelled by the MDSHA in 1972 due to opposition from officials in Montgomery County.    In 1975, the Federal Highway Administration officially approved withdrawal of plans to construct the road south of the Capital Beltway.   On May 18, 1975, I-70S was designated I-270 and the US 240 designation was removed from the road.     The western spur is now signed and publicly known simply as Interstate 270 Spur. By the 1980s, traffic congestion had grown on I-270 in Montgomery County; as a result, a  $200 million project widened the road between I-495 and MD 118 to its current configuration, with some portions being widened to twelve lanes. This widening led to growth of residences and businesses along the I-270 corridor as far north as Germantown and increased traffic counts along the road.     Much of I-270 in Montgomery County is now a hub for biotech firms.    By 1999, congestion on the road grew to then-projected 2010 levels.  FutureThe MDSHA is studying improvements for the I-270 corridor between Shady Grove Road and Frederick. Options for improvement include widening the highway to include more lanes with HOV and express toll lanes, as well as initiating rapid bus or light rail service along I-270 between Shady Grove and Clarksburg.    In addition, two new interchanges are planned for I-270 in Frederick County. The first planned interchange is with Maryland Route 75 near the Montgomery County border, which would involve extending MD 75 from MD 355 to the interchange with I-270 at a projected cost of $57,300,000. The other planned interchange is with Park Mills Road in Urbana, which has a projected cost of $48,900,000.    In Montgomery County, an interchange is being proposed with an extension of Watkins Mill Road in Gaithersburg. This proposed interchange, which is being pushed by Montgomery County, has seen $2.4 million in design spending.    Funding for this interchange disappeared in September 2008 after the state of Maryland announced it was cutting $1.1 billion that was to go to transportation projects.    Exit list                                              Interstate 270 SpurInterstate 270 Spur (referred to as I-270Y by the MDSHA) is a   spur off I-270 that connects I-270 and the Capital Beltway.  It carries traffic headed southbound on I-270 to southbound I-495 and from northbound I-495 to northbound I-270, filling in the missing movements not available at the interchange between I-270 and I-495.    The road heads north from I-495 as a six-lane freeway with a   speed limit. The left lane in each direction serves as a HOV lane in operation between 3:30 and 6:30 PM weekdays in the northbound direction and between 6:00 and 9:00 AM weekdays in the southbound direction.   I-270 Spur continues north through wooded suburban areas to an interchange with Democracy Boulevard adjacent to the Westfield Montgomery shopping mall.  A short distance later, the road has a southbound exit and northbound entrance for the HOV lanes onto Fernwood Drive. Past here, I-270 Spur merges into northbound I-270 with separate ramps for the travel lanes and the HOV lanes.  Before 1975, when I-270 was called I-70S, this road was called I-270, without the word "Spur".  Exit list             See also      References  External links     I-270 @ MDRoads.com               
Interstate 170 (Maryland)   Interstate 170 (abbreviated I-170) is the former designation for a   freeway in Baltimore, Maryland that is now designated as part of US 40.  The highway was originally envisioned as the eastern terminus of the Maryland portion of Interstate 70, a major transcontinental route, and was later envisioned as a direct link between the Interstate and the western edge of the central business district of Baltimore.  However, with the loss of Interstate 70 in Baltimore, the route was deleted as an Interstate.  Disapproval of the remaining depressed highway by Baltimore citizens, as well as environmental groups, has earned it the common nicknames of "The Highway to Nowhere" and "The Ditch"; in addition, other names include the "Westside Freeway" and the "Franklin–Mulberry Expressway", both referring to its location in the city. Route descriptionI-170 would have begun at a directional-T interchange with I-70 where Baltimore Street and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor cross Gwynns Falls.  The Interstate would have paralleled the north side of the railroad tracks through what is presently an industrial area.  I-170 would have crossed Mulberry Street (eastbound US 40) and veered east through what are now parking lots for the West Baltimore station on MARC's Penn Line to seamlessly connect with the portion of I-170 that was constructed east of Pulaski Street.  The unconstructed freeway would have had an eastbound exit ramp to Mulberry Street and a westbound entrance ramp from Franklin Street.  These ramps, which were partially constructed when the highway was built and torn down in 2010, would have connected US 1 with I-170 in the direction of I-70.The ramps from Mulberry Street and to Franklin Street to connect with the portion of I-170 that was completed are now part of US 40.  The ramps merge with the uncompleted freeway under Fulton Avenue (northbound US 1).  US 40 heads east as a six-lane freeway in a cut between Mulberry Street and Franklin Street.  Along the way, it passes under eight roadway bridges and two pedestrian bridges (Stricker Street and Carrollton Avenue).  East of the Schroeder Street underpass, the freeway reduces to four lanes at the eastbound ramp to Mulberry Street and the westbound ramp from Franklin Street, which connect the freeway with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.  After US 40 passes over the boulevard, the freeway ends by merging with Mulberry Street and Franklin Street just west of their intersections with Greene Street, which heads south as MD 295.  HistoryUnder the proposed routing of the Interstate Highways through Baltimore, Interstate 70 would have been routed through West Baltimore to join Interstate 95, and Interstate 170 would have been a spur from Interstate 70 into central Baltimore.  However, the spur was left stranded from the rest of the Interstate Highway System by the cancellation of Interstate 70 within the city limits of Baltimore. PlanningSeveral proposals were made during the 1940s and 1950s for an East–West Expressway through Baltimore. After nine different proposals were floated, in 1960 the city's Department of Planning published a proposal of its own. The route in the proposal (then designated as I-70N) would have begun in the western edge of the city, passing through Leakin Park and Gwynns Falls Park. It would have then curved south in the direction of Edmonson Avenue, then turned east and followed the Franklin St.-Mulberry St. corridor. It would have then curved south into the Pratt St. corridor and crossed the city to the north of the Inner Harbor on an elevated viaduct within the central business district, junctioning I-83 and I-95 in the southeast edge of the CBD. This routing was eventually further refined and modified and eventually became part of the Baltimore 10-D Interstate System, approved in 1962. Kozel, Scott. Roads to the Future: Baltimore Early Expressway Planning URL accessed 17:55, 5 February 2007. By 1969, the Design Concept Team, a multi-discipline group assembled in 1966 by the city government to help design freeway routings that would not disrupt the city's fabric, had replaced the 10-D System with the Baltimore 3-A Interstate and Boulevard System. In the 3-A system, I-170 was brought into existence, and was planned as a freeway spur from I-70 (which would continue south toward the current alignment of I-95) through the Franklin St.-Mulberry St. corridor formerly followed by the East–West Expressway to the west edge of the central business district, connecting to a new route named Harbor City Boulevard (now known as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). Besides ending at the western edge of the central business district, I-170 would also run further south than the original East-West Expressway proposal. The 3-A System's result was that I-170 would provide direct access to the central business district.  Curiously, I-170's three-way semi-directional interchange with I-70 was planned to be partially integrated with I-70's interchange with Hilton Parkway; diagrams of the interchange show that the ramp from eastbound I-70 to eastbound I-170 would have diverged within the latter interchange and run alongside I-70's eastbound carriageway to the western terminus of I-170, where it would diverge. Scale drawing of I-70, I-170, I-95, I-395 interchanges in Baltimore City  ConstructionConstruction began on I-170 in 1975 and was finished in 1979.  The completed section runs mainly below street level, rising above it at the eastern end; the same was also true for the western end until it was leveled in late 2010.  The wide median space was originally reserved for a once-proposed branch of the Baltimore Metro Subway system; this rail line was never built, but current plans for the Red Line, a proposed light rail corridor to be built by 2016, makes use of the median. CancellationI-170's future was left in doubt after extended protest from environmental groups led to the cancellation of the segment of Interstate 70 between Security Boulevard (Exit 94) and I-170 (future Exit 96) on September 3, 1981. As a result of this cancellation, it was proposed to connect the existing I-170 to I-95 via the southern portion of the original proposed I-70 expansion, with the entire spur redesignated Interstate 595; however, this segment was canceled on July 22, 1983 in the face of further opposition. Federal Highway Administration. Ask the Rambler: Why Does I-70 End in Cove Fort, Utah? URL accessed 12:15, 21 January 2007.  "Interstate 595" was later assigned to a different highway in Maryland (it now exists as an unsigned name for US 50 between the Capital Beltway and Annapolis). With I-170's connection to the Interstate system removed, it was promptly deleted. US 40 was rerouted onto the stub freeway in its place. FutureVarious proposals for the isolated highway stub have been floated: in addition to the proposed use of its public transit right of way, it has also been suggested that the road be dismantled, with land filled for new homes to replace the ones that had been demolished for the freeway's construction.  In 2010, demolition work began on the structures at the western edge of the highway that had been intended to link to the wider Interstate system and had never been used by automobiles; by 2012, these will be replaced by green space and an expanded parking lot for the nearby West Baltimore MARC Station, and Payson Street will be made continuous between Mulberry and Franklin Streets.  The remaining section of the highway is still key to the proposed Red Line project.

Interstate 470 (Maryland) 
Kentlands, Gaithersburg, Maryland    Kentlands is a neighborhood of the city of Gaithersburg, Maryland in the United States. Kentlands was one of the first attempts to develop a community using Traditional Neighborhood Design planning techniques (also known as neo-traditional new town planning) that are now generally referred to under the rubric of the New Urbanism. The New Urbanism is the concept of building from scratch a walkable, mixed-use city neighborhood or new town in order to provide an attractive alternative to the spread out, automobile-centric, subdivisions common to post-World War II American suburbia. Kentlands is built around a farmstead previously owned by Otis Beall Kent. The development, begun in 1988, contains buildings from the original Kentlands farm, many varieties of residences, a "downtown" commercial district, open space including protected natural areas and pocket parks, and civic uses including schools, a church, and an arts center.  HistoryKentlands is built on a former farm estate that had its origins in a 1723 land grant to Joseph West. In the mid-18th century, Henry Clagett, a prosperous farmer, acquired much of this land for his holdings. When Clagett died in 1777, several sections of this property passed to his son, Joseph.The Tschiffely family began to farm the land in 1852, when Frederick A. Tschiffely, who owned a prominent wholesale pharmaceutical business in Washington, D.C., purchased more than   of land from the Clagett heirs. In 1900, his son, also named Frederick A. Tschiffely, built the impressive brick mansion, barn, gatehouse, overseer's house, greenhouse and chicken coop that gave the property the nickname of "The Bricks". The family called their estate Wheatlands, after the wheat that was grown on the farm, and raised their eight children in the mansion. Mr. Tschiffely was the largest wholesale pharmaceutical distributor in the Washington area, and owner of Washington's best-known pharmacy. His daily commute to Washington began with a horse and buggy drive to the Gaithersburg train station.In 1942, the Tschiffely family sold the land to Otis Beall Kent. Kent, a wealthy tax lawyer, renamed the land Kentlands Farm, and he set about to create a gentleman's estate and wildlife sanctuary. In the 1960s, part of the land was given to the Izaak Walton League and the National Geographic Society with conditions of maintaining much of the land as a wildlife sanctuary. Mr. Kent bequeathed the remainder of the property to his adopted daughter, Helene Danger Kent. That portion was annexed into the city of Gaithersburg and was sold in 1988 to the town creator, Joe Alfandre. Alfandre, a developer, brought in Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (partners in what was then called DPZ), two urban planners credited with designing the town of Seaside, Florida. After the June 1988 Kentlands Charrette, several historic buildings were donated to the city, . The neighborhood was built in a process that involved several additional charrettes. As the project was nearing completion, a sister development, named Lakelands, was built adjacent to Kentlands. Lakelands also was designed in a charrette process including the DPZ team, the city staff, and local residents. Construction started in 1989, and the first model homes opened in mid-1990. The first Kentlands residents moved into new homes in 1991. SitesA number of historic landmarks from the original Kent Farm were refurbished and donated to the city. The Kentlands Mansion, the main residence of the farm owners and the center of historic Kentlands Farm, is now a city-owned venue for art exhibits, concerts, and public events, and is available as a rental for private parties and meetings. The Kentlands Barn has been converted into a public arts center with studios, exhibit space, and a ninety-nine seat theater used for theatrical performances and concerts. The former farm manager's house has been transformed into a private residence, another farm building into the town architect's office, and another building was sold to the Kentlands Citizens Assembly – Kentlands' administrative body – which converted it into a meeting place, exhibit hall, and the headquarters of the Kentlands Community Foundation. The old Kentlands Firehouse, garden buildings, a "peacock house," and other historic artifacts have not yet been restored, while some ruins have become part of privately owned property or city parks.   The town also has a system of artificial lakes that snakes through the community. There are jogging trails that run through the parks and various districts of the neighborhood, and the community's commercial areas and the facilities operated by the Assembly, which include swimming pools, tennis courts, playgrounds, performance spaces, and a large clubhouse, are all within walking distance.Kentlands is divided into several districts, including "Old Farm", built around the historic mansion and the Kentlands Village Square; "Gatehouse", named after the farm's entry gatehouse, which has been reconstructed; the "Hill Districts"; the "Lakes Districts"; "Kentlands Bluff"; "Midtown/Main Street"; "Market Square"; and "Kentlands Square". The winding street layout is based on a grid pattern, varied as necessary by the requirements of Kentlands topography.  Multiple open green spaces and pocket parks have been developed where land was available between the districts or in odd spaces near buildings and dwellings.  Market Square, Kentlands Square, and the Boulevard Shops are commercial districts with grocery stores, banks, boutiques, offices, stores, dozens of restaurants, and a 10-screen cinema cafe.  Main Street is a mixed-use area with distinctive "live-work" buildings with retail and office uses on the lower floors and residential uses on the upper floors. City planners, public officials, business owners, and neighborhood residents recently worked with urban designers the from HOK global architecture firm at the Kentlands Commercial District Charrette, in which a plan was developed for an intensified mixed-use and transit-oriented Downtown Kentlands. The proposals developed in the charrette are now winding their way through the City of Gaithersburg's master planning process.Kentlands, along with its sister community Lakelands, is among the largest and arguably most successful of the New Urbanist projects. More than 8,000 residents now live in Kentlands and Lakelands, with office and commercial development totaling more than  .Rachel Carson Elementary School is at one entrance to the community and Lakelands Park Middle School divides the newer development of Lakelands from the former National Geographic complex that is adjacent to it, now occupied by GXS and the Peapod home delivery grocery service.

Boyds, Maryland Boyds, Maryland is an unincorporated community in rural Montgomery County, Maryland, located north of Washington, DC.  Its ZIP Code is 20841.According to the United States 2000 Census, the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for the town of Boyds covers an area of   and has a population of 2,025.  Black Hill Regional Park, and most notably Little Seneca Lake, are part of Boyds. HistoryThe community was named for Colonel James Alexander Boyd (1823–1896), a Scottish immigrant who was a construction engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O). He built a temporary village to house construction workers as the B&O built the Metropolitan Branch line after the Civil War.  The railroad line began service in 1873.  A mill, stores and other businesses were established in the area after the railroad station opened.  The B&O opened a brick railroad station in 1887, and demolished it in 1927 to make way for installation of a second track. A wooden station was built as a replacement, but was later taken down.    Passenger train service is still provided at Boyds by the MARC system.James Boyd established dairy farms in the area and lived in the town until his death in 1896. Boyds has until recently been a predominantly rural area. However, since the 2000 Census, there has been enormous population growth.  Large, multi-thousand home developments such as "The Vistas," near the intersection of Route 118 and Richter Farm Road, have rapidly replaced farmland and forest throughout the Germantown and Clarksburg areas bordering sections of the town.More recently, there has been some discussion as to the exact southern boundary of Boyds. Survey maps show that the town's southern boundary runs along Little Seneca Creek. Since the new multi-thousand home developments lie south of this creek, this means that technically these new communities are part of Germantown. In addition, these communities have long been part of Germantown's Master Plan.  So, although, the ZIP code of these new communities continues to be 20841 which is served by the Boyds post office, they are not actually part of the town of Boyds.The racial demographics are: 88% white, 4% Hispanic, 7.5% black, 0.5% Asian. Boyds Negro School The Boyds Negro School, located on White Ground Road, was the only public school made for African Americans who lived in the area from 1885-1936. It is also considered a Maryland Historic Site. It is a small, one room school house, containing a small number of desks, a blackboard, and an authentic potbelly stove, as well as a framed picture of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Subjects taught in the school included spelling, cooking, reading, singing, and weaving.  The school was renovated by the Clarksburg/Boyds Historical Society in 1989. They filled the building with furnishings which helped make the school look like it did in the early 1900s. It was renovated again in 2006 when termites caused major damage to the wooden floor boards. It reopened on June 28, 2008, one of Montgomery County's annual heritage days.  The school is currently open to the public the last Sunday of every month, from 1:00-3:00 PM.    Boyds Mercantile and Stores The first Boyds Country Store was opened in 1873 (the same year that the railroad was connected to the town) and run by Mr. James E. Williams. It served not only as a market of goods for both citizens and passers-bye in Boyds, but also as a meeting place for the townspeople in the afternoon. Colonel Boyd built a second store across the road in 1895. It housed the general store and post office on its first floor and a town hall on the second floor along with a dance hall. As time went by, the town hall became smaller and smaller as the building was used for additional purposes until it was finally torn down for salvageable lumber in the early 1940s. In the evenings families would gather on the front porch of the general store; the parents talking and their children playing out on the lawn in front of the store.  After the first country store became vacant in 1946, it was bought in an auction by Mr. Brice P. Selby. He was known to often keep his customers on tab, resulting in not much profit for him and his store. However, he was well known as a kind and generous soul.  A third store, known as the Boyds Country Market, exists on Barnesville road across from the site of the old town hall. It was built by Mr. Will Williams in 1933. The first two grocery stores, as well as the town hall, old Hoyle's Mill, and a hardware store were all destroyed in the development of the surrounding area. A small post office was located at the back of the country store from the early 1930s until 1974, when it was relocated to a new building on Barnesville road, where it still sits today.

Stevenson, Maryland     Stevenson is an unincorporated community located in the northern section of Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. It serves as the location of the central campus of Stevenson University (formerly called Villa Julie College). It is also home to St. Timothy's School, an all-girls boarding and day high school. Fort Garrison was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.    References      
Severn River (Maryland)    The Severn River runs   U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011  through Anne Arundel County in the U.S. state of Maryland. It is located south of the Magothy River, and north of the South River. GeographyThe Severn has a watershed area (including the water surface) of  , or   of land.  Thus, its total watershed area is 15% water. From its headwaters in western Anne Arundel County, the river enters the Chesapeake Bay at the major port city of Annapolis, also the capital of Maryland.  Most famous for the United States Naval Academy campus situated at the mouth of the river, the Severn provides an access point to the Chesapeake Bay for fishermen, hobby boaters, and Midshipmen.  Its nontidal portion is called Severn Run, which has several branches, including Jabez Branch. Several of its creeks drain highly developed areas, including Weems Creek and its nontidal portion Cowhide Branch, which drain most of the Annapolis Mall and the Anne Arundel Medical Center. The Severn is crossed by two bridges. One, known as the Severn River Bridge or Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, carries US 50/US 301/MD 2 and was first built in 1886. The other carries MD 450, and is now officially named the "US Naval Academy Bridge" because its south end is near the academy.  The latter bridge was built as a drawbridge in the late 1920s and replaced with the current high span in 1994.  There used to be a railroad trestle between the two current bridges, built in about 1887 for the Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line Railroad (which became part of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway), that was removed after 1968 when it was declared unsafe. Almost all of the tidal creeks and coves on the Severn are named, along with many of the nontidal creeks that drain to them, as the result of a project started in 2001 by the Magothy River Association, working with the Severn River Association, and funded by the Chesapeake Bay Trust.  The late Colby Rucker was very helpful with finding the names.  Some of the names are only shown on the map produced by the Severn River Association in 2005; see “References” below to see how to get a copy of it. Alternate names (current or historical) are shown in parentheses where they are known.  If the upper nontidal portion has a different name, or there are named creeks or coves off that creek, they are listed after the &.

It was on what are now grounds of Naval Station Annapolis (recently renamed Naval Support Activity Annapolis).  The land on which it was located has probably all eroded away.

Maryland Campaign   The Maryland Campaign—or Antietam Campaign—occurred September 4–20, 1862, during the American Civil War. Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North was repulsed by the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who moved to intercept Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia and eventually attacked it near Sharpsburg, Maryland. The resulting Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest single-day battle in American history and is widely considered one of the major turning points of the war.Following his victory in the Northern Virginia Campaign, Lee moved north with 55,000 men through the Shenandoah Valley starting on September 4, 1862. His objective was to resupply his army outside of the war-torn Virginia theater and to damage Northern morale in anticipation of the November elections. He undertook the risky maneuver of splitting his army so that he could continue north into Maryland while simultaneously capturing the Federal garrison and arsenal at Harpers Ferry. McClellan accidentally found a copy of Lee's orders to his subordinate commanders and planned to isolate and defeat the separated portions of Lee's army.While Confederate Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson surrounded, bombarded, and captured Harpers Ferry (September 12–15), McClellan's army of 84,000 men attempted to move quickly through the South Mountain passes that separated him from Lee. The Battle of South Mountain on September 14 delayed McClellan's advance and allowed Lee sufficient time to concentrate most of his army at Sharpsburg. The Battle of Antietam (or Sharpsburg) on September 17 was the bloodiest day in American military history with over 22,000 casualties. Lee, outnumbered two to one, moved his defensive forces to parry each offensive blow, but McClellan never deployed all of the reserves of his army to capitalize on localized successes and destroy the Confederates. On September 18, Lee ordered a withdrawal across the Potomac and on September 19–20, fights by Lee's rear guard at Shepherdstown ended the campaign.Although Antietam was a tactical draw, Lee's Maryland Campaign failed to achieve its objectives. President Abraham Lincoln used this Union victory as the justification for announcing his Emancipation Proclamation, which effectively ended any threat of European support for the Confederacy. BackgroundThe year 1862 started out well for Union forces in the Eastern Theater. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac had invaded the Virginia Peninsula during the Peninsula Campaign and by June stood only a few miles outside the Confederate capital at Richmond. But, when Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia on June 1, 1862, fortunes reversed. Lee fought McClellan aggressively in the Seven Days Battles; McClellan lost his nerve, and his army retreated down the Peninsula. Lee then conducted the Northern Virginia Campaign in which he outmaneuvered and defeated Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia, most significantly at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas). Lee's Maryland Campaign can be considered the concluding part of a logically connected, three-campaign, summer offensive against Federal forces in the Eastern Theater. The Confederates had suffered significant manpower losses in the wake of the summer campaigns. Nevertheless, Lee decided his army was ready for a great challenge: an invasion of the North. His goal was to reach the major Northern states of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and cut off the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad line that supplied Washington, D.C. His movements would threaten Washington and Baltimore, so as to "annoy and harass the enemy." Several motives led to Lee's decision to launch an invasion. First, he needed to supply his army and knew the farms of the North had been untouched by war, unlike those in Virginia. Moving the war northward would relieve pressure on Virginia. Second was the issue of Northern morale. Lee knew the Confederacy did not have to win the war by defeating the North militarily; it merely needed to make the Northern populace and government unwilling to continue the fight. With the Congressional elections of 1862 approaching in November, Lee believed that an invading army playing havoc inside the North could tip the balance of Congress to the Democratic Party, which might force Abraham Lincoln to negotiate an end to the war. He told Confederate President Jefferson Davis in a letter of September 3 that the enemy was "much weakened and demoralized." There were secondary reasons as well. The Confederate invasion might be able to incite an uprising in Maryland, especially given that it was a slave-holding state and many of its citizens held a sympathetic stance toward the South. Some Confederate politicians, including Jefferson Davis, believed the prospect of foreign recognition for the Confederacy would be made stronger by a military victory on Northern soil, but there is no evidence that Lee thought the South should base its military plans on this possibility. Nevertheless, the news of the victory at Second Bull Run and the start of Lee's invasion caused considerable diplomatic activity between the Confederate States and France and England. After the defeat of Pope at Second Bull Run, President Lincoln reluctantly returned to the man who had mended a broken army before—George B. McClellan after the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas). He knew that McClellan was a strong organizer and a skilled trainer of troops, able to recombine the units of Pope's army with the Army of the Potomac faster than anyone. On September 2, 1862, Lincoln named McClellan to command "the fortifications of Washington, and all the troops for the defense of the capital."  The appointment was controversial in the Cabinet, a majority of whom signed a petition declaring to the president "our deliberate opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of any Army of the United States."  The president admitted that it was like "curing the bite with the hair of the dog." But Lincoln told his secretary, John Hay, "We must use what tools we have. There is no man in the Army who can man these fortifications and lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he. If he can't fight himself, he excels in making others ready to fight."

Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was organized into two large infantry corps, about 55,000 effectives at the beginning of September.  The First Corps, under Maj. Gen. James Longstreet, consisted of the divisions of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, Brig. Gen. David R. Jones, Brig. Gen. John G. Walker, Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood, and an independent brigade under Brig. Gen. Nathan G. "Shanks" Evans.The Second Corps, under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson, consisted of the divisions of Brig. Gen. Alexander R. Lawton, Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill (the Light Division), Brig. Gen. John R. Jones, and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill. The remaining units were the Cavalry Corps, under Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, and the reserve artillery, commanded by Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton. The Second Corps was organized with artillery attached to each division, in contrast to the First Corps, which reserved its artillery at the corps level.

The I Corps, under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, consisted of the divisions of Brig. Gens. Rufus King, James B. Ricketts, and George G. Meade.    The II Corps, under Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner, consisted of the divisions of Maj. Gens. Israel B. Richardson and John Sedgwick, and Brig. Gen. William H. French.    The V Corps, under Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, consisted of the divisions of Maj. Gen. George W. Morell, Brig. Gen. George Sykes, and Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys.    The VI Corps, under Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, consisted of the divisions of Maj. Gens. Henry W. Slocum and William F. "Baldy" Smith, and a division from the IV Corps under Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch.    The IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, consisted of the divisions of Brig. Gens. Orlando B. Willcox, Samuel D. Sturgis, and Isaac P. Rodman, and the Kanawha Division, under Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox.    The XII Corps, under Maj. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield, consisted of the divisions of Brig. Gens. Alpheus S. Williams and George S. Greene, and the cavalry division of Brig. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton.  During the march north into Maryland, McClellan changed his army's command structure, appointing commanders for three "wings": the left, commanded by William B. Franklin, consisted of his own VI Corps plus the division of Darius Couch; the center, under Edwin Sumner, consisted of his II Corps and the XII Corps; the right, under Ambrose Burnside, consisted of his IX Corps (temporarily commanded by Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno) and the I Corps. This wing organization was revoked just before the start of the Battle of Antietam.  Initial movements On September 3, just two days after the Battle of Chantilly, Lee wrote to President Davis that he had decided to cross into Maryland unless the president objected. On the same day, Lee began shifting his army north and west from Chantilly towards Leesburg, Virginia. On September 4, advance elements of the Army of Northern Virginia crossed into Maryland from Loudoun County. The main body of the army advanced into Frederick, Maryland, on September 7. The 55,000-man army had been reinforced by troops who had been defending Richmond—the divisions of Maj. Gens. D.H. Hill and Lafayette McLaws and two brigades under Brig. Gen. John G. Walker—but they merely made up for the 9,000 men lost at Bull Run and Chantilly. Lee's invasion coincided with another strategic offensive by the Confederacy. Generals Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith had simultaneously launched invasions of Kentucky.  Jefferson Davis sent to all three generals a draft public proclamation, with blank spaces available for them to insert the name of whatever state their invading forces might reach. Davis wrote to explain to the public (and, indirectly, the European Powers) why the South seemed to be changing its strategy. Until this point, the Confederacy had claimed it was the victim of aggression and was merely defending itself against "foreign invasion." Davis explained that the Confederacy was still waging a war of self-defense. He wrote there was "no design of conquest," and that the invasions were only an aggressive effort to force the Lincoln government to let the South go in peace. "We are driven to protect our own country by transferring the seat of war to that of an enemy who pursues us with a relentless and apparently aimless hostility." Davis's draft proclamation did not reach his generals until after they had issued proclamations of their own. They stressed that they had come as liberators, not conquerors, to these border states, but they did not address the larger issue of the Confederate strategy shift as Davis had desired. Lee's proclamation announced to the people of Maryland that his army had come "with the deepest sympathy [for] the wrongs that have been inflicted upon the citizens of the commonwealth allied to the States of the South by the strongest social, political, and commercial ties ... to aid you in throwing off this foreign yoke, to enable you again to enjoy the inalienable rights of freemen."  Dividing Lee's armyLee divided his army into four parts as it moved into Maryland. After receiving intelligence of militia activity in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Lee sent Maj. Gen. James Longstreet to Boonsboro and then to Hagerstown. (The intelligence overstated the threat since only 20 militiamen were in Chambersburg at the time.) Eicher, p. 339  Maj. Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson was ordered to seize the Union arsenal at Harpers Ferry with three separate columns. This left only the thinly spread cavalry of Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart and the division of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill to guard the army's rear at South Mountain. The specific reason Lee chose this risky strategy of splitting his army to capture Harpers Ferry is not known. One possibility is that he knew it commanded his supply lines through the Shenandoah Valley. Before he entered Maryland he had assumed that the Federal garrisons at Winchester, Martinsburg, and Harpers Ferry would be cut off and abandoned without firing a shot (and, in fact, both Winchester and Martinsburg were evacuated). Sears, Landscape, p. 83.  Another possibility is that it was simply a tempting target with many vital supplies but virtually indefensible.  McClellan requested permission from Washington to evacuate Harpers Ferry and attach its garrison to his army, but his request was refused.  Reactions to invasionLee's invasion was fraught with difficulties from the beginning. The Confederate Army's numerical strength suffered in the wake of straggling and desertion. Although he started from Chantilly with 55,000 men, within 10 days this number had diminished to 45,000. McPherson, p. 100.  Some troops refused to cross the Potomac River because an invasion of Union territory violated their beliefs that they were fighting only to defend their states from Northern aggression. Countless others became ill with diarrhea after eating unripe "green corn" from the Maryland fields or fell out because their shoeless feet were bloodied on hard-surfaced Northern roads.  Lee ordered his commanders to deal harshly with stragglers, whom he considered cowards "who desert their comrades in peril" and were therefore "unworthy members of an army that has immortalized itself" in its recent campaigns. Upon entering Maryland, the Confederates found little support; rather, they were met with reactions that ranged from a cool lack of enthusiasm, to, in most cases, open hostility. Robert E. Lee was disappointed at the state's resistance, a condition that he had not anticipated. Although Maryland was a slaveholding state, Confederate sympathies were considerably less pronounced among the civilian population, which generally supported the Union cause, than among the pro-secession Maryland legislature. Furthermore, many of the fiercely pro-Southern Marylanders had already traveled south at the beginning of the war to join the Confederate Army in Virginia. Only a "few score" of men joined Lee's columns in Maryland. Maryland and Pennsylvania, alarmed and outraged by the invasion, rose at once to arms. Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin called for 50,000 militia to turn out, and he nominated Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, a native Pennsylvanian, to command them. (This caused considerable frustration to McClellan and Reynolds's corps commander, Joseph Hooker, but general-in-chief Henry W. Halleck ordered Reynolds to serve under Curtin and told Hooker to find a new division commander.) As far north as Wilkes-Barre, church and courthouse bells rang out, calling men to drill. In Maryland, panic was much more widespread than in Pennsylvania, which was not yet immediately threatened. Baltimore, which Lee incorrectly regarded as a hotbed of secession merely waiting for the appearance of Confederate armies to revolt, took up the war call against him immediately. When it was learned in Baltimore that Southern armies had crossed the Potomac, the reaction was one of instantaneous hysteria followed quickly by stoic resolution. Crowds milled in the street outside newspaper offices waiting for the latest bulletins, and the sale of liquor was halted to restrain the excitable. The public stocked up on food and other essentials, fearing a siege. Philadelphia was also sent into a flurry of frenzied preparations, despite being over 150 miles (240 km) from Hagerstown and in no immediate danger.  McClellan's pursuit  McClellan moved out of Washington starting on September 7 with his 87,000-man army in a lethargic pursuit.  He was a naturally cautious general and assumed he would be facing over 120,000 Confederates. He also was maintaining running arguments with the government in Washington, demanding that the forces defending the capital city report to him.  The army started with relatively low morale, a consequence of its defeats on the Peninsula and at Second Bull Run, but upon crossing into Maryland, their spirits were boosted by the "friendly, almost tumultuous welcome" that they received from the citizens of the state. The Army of the Potomac reached Frederick, Maryland, on September 13. There, Union soldiers discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed campaign plans of Lee's army—Special Order 191—wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically, thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, "Now I know what to do!" He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will be willing to go home." He telegraphed President Lincoln: "I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be severely punished for it. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. ... Will send you trophies." McClellan waited 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence. His delay squandered the opportunity to destroy Lee's army. On the night of September 13, the Army of the Potomac moved toward South Mountain, with Burnside's right wing of the army directed to Turner's Gap, and Franklin's left wing to Crampton's Gap. South Mountain is the name given to the continuation of the Blue Ridge Mountains after they enter Maryland. It is a natural obstacle that separates the Shenandoah Valley and Cumberland Valley from the eastern part of Maryland. Crossing the passes of South Mountain was the only way to reach Lee's army. Lee, seeing McClellan's uncharacteristic aggressive actions, and possibly learning through a Confederate sympathizer that his order had been compromised,  quickly moved to concentrate his army. He chose not to abandon his invasion and return to Virginia yet, because Jackson had not completed the capture of Harpers Ferry. Instead, he chose to make a stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland. In the meantime, elements of the Army of Northern Virginia waited in defense of the passes of South Mountain. Although he was being pursued at a leisurely pace by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and the Union Army of the Potomac, outnumbering him more than two to one, Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army to seize the prize of Harpers Ferry. While the corps of Maj. Gen. James Longstreet drove north in the direction of Hagerstown, Lee sent columns of troops to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from three directions. The largest column, 11,500 men under Jackson, was to recross the Potomac and circle around to the west of Harpers Ferry and attack it from Bolivar Heights, while the other two columns, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws (8,000 men) and Brig. Gen. John G. Walker (3,400), were to capture Maryland Heights and Loudoun Heights, commanding the town from the east and south.  Battles of the Maryland Campaign Harpers Ferry   As Jackson's three columns approached Harpers Ferry, Col. Dixon S. Miles, Union commander of the garrison, insisted on keeping most of the troops near the town instead of taking up commanding positions on the surrounding heights. The South Carolinians under Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw encountered the slim defenses of the most important position, Maryland Heights, but only brief skirmishing ensued. Strong attacks by the brigades of Kershaw and William Barksdale on September 13 drove the mostly inexperienced Union troops from the heights. During the fighting on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived and were astonished to see that critical positions to the west and south of town were not defended. Jackson methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry and ordered Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah River in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning. By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights. He began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless and agreed with his subordinates to raise the white flag of surrender. Before he could surrender personally, he was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and died the next day. Jackson took possession of Harpers Ferry and more than 12,000 Union prisoners, then led most of his men to join Lee at Sharpsburg, leaving Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's division to complete the occupation of the town.  South Mountain  Pitched battles were fought on September 14 for possession of the South Mountain passes: Crampton's, Turner's, and Fox's Gaps. Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill defended Turner's and Fox's Gaps against Burnside. To the south, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws defended Crampton's Gap against Franklin. Franklin was able to break through at Crampton's Gap, but the Confederates were able to hold Turner's and Fox's, if only precariously. Lee realized the futility of his position against the numerically superior Union forces, and he ordered his troops to Sharpsburg. McClellan was then theoretically in a position to destroy Lee's army before it could concentrate. McClellan's limited activity on September 15 after his victory at South Mountain, however, condemned the garrison at Harpers Ferry to capture and gave Lee time to unite his scattered divisions at Sharpsburg.  Antietam (Sharpsburg)   On September 16, McClellan confronted Lee near Sharpsburg, defending a line to the west of Antietam Creek. At dawn on September 17, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's I Corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee's left flank that began the bloody battle. Attacks and counterattacks swept across the Miller Cornfield and the woods near the Dunker Church as Maj. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield's XII Corps joined to reinforce Hooker. Union assaults against the Sunken Road ("Bloody Lane") by Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner's II Corps eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not pressed. In the afternoon, Burnside's IX Corps crossed a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and rolled up the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, A.P. Hill's division arrived from Harpers Ferry and counterattacked, driving back Burnside's men and saving Lee's army from destruction. Although outnumbered two to one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in only four of his six available corps. This enabled Lee to shift brigades across the battlefield and counter each individual Union assault. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties—Union 12,401, or 25%; Confederate 10,316, or 31%—Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18, while transporting his wounded men south of the Potomac. McClellan did not renew the offensive. After dark, Lee ordered the battered Army of Northern Virginia to withdraw across the Potomac into the Shenandoah Valley.  Shepherdstown  On September 19, a detachment of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps pushed across the river at Boteler's Ford, attacked the Confederate rear guard commanded by Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, and captured four guns. Early on September 20, Porter pushed elements of two divisions across the Potomac to establish a bridgehead. A.P. Hill's division counterattacked while many of the Federals were crossing and nearly annihilated the 118th Pennsylvania (the "Corn Exchange" Regiment), inflicting 269 casualties. This rearguard action discouraged further Federal pursuit.  Aftermath and diplomatic implications Lee successfully withdrew across the Potomac, ending the Maryland Campaign and summer campaigning altogether. President Lincoln was disappointed in McClellan's performance. He believed that the general's cautious and poorly coordinated actions in the field had forced the battle to a draw rather than a crippling Confederate defeat. He was even more astonished that from September 17 to October 26, despite repeated entreaties from the War Department and the president, McClellan declined to pursue Lee across the Potomac, citing shortages of equipment and the fear of overextending his forces. General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck wrote in his official report, "The long inactivity of so large an army in the face of a defeated foe, and during the most favorable season for rapid movements and a vigorous campaign, was a matter of great disappointment and regret."  Lincoln relieved McClellan of his command of the Army of the Potomac on November 7, effectively ending the general's military career. Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside rose to command the Army of the Potomac. The Eastern Theater was relatively quiet until December, when Lee faced Burnside at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Although a tactical draw, the Battle of Antietam was a strategic victory for the Union. It forced the end of Lee's strategic invasion of the North and gave Abraham Lincoln the victory he was awaiting before announcing the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, which took effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to do so earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to make this announcement after a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Confederate reversal at Antietam also dissuaded the governments of France and Great Britain from recognizing the Confederacy. And, with the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, it became less likely that future battlefield victories would induce foreign recognition. Lincoln had effectively highlighted slavery as a tenet of the Confederate States of America, and the abhorrence of slavery in France and Great Britain would not allow for intervention on behalf of the South. The Union lost 15,220 men during the Maryland campaign (2,535 killed, 11,426 wounded, 1,259 missing).  Notes  References  Bailey, Ronald H., and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

Maryland Route 100  Maryland Route 100 (MD 100 or Route 100) is a major east–west highway connecting U.S. Route 29 (US 29) in Ellicott City (just north of Columbia) and MD 177 (Mountain Road) in Pasadena. MD 100 also connects to Interstate 95 (I-95), US 1, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (MD 295), and I-97. The highway connects Howard County to the west with Anne Arundel County and the Chesapeake Bay to the east.  MD 100 also provides access to the Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI) and the Arundel Mills shopping mall. The eastern section of MD 100 in Anne Arundel County is known as the Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway.  The name comes in dedication to Paul T. Pitcher, an Anne Arundel County executive, who originally conceived the highway.  Route description The route begins as a six-lane divided expressway at US 29 near Ellicott City. There are then interchanges with MD 108,  MD 104, Snowden River Parkway and MD 103.At the junction with I-95, the road narrows to four lanes. Then MD 100 intersects with US 1 followed by an exit for Dorsey MARC station. It then crosses the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.MD 100 then intersects with MD 170 (Telegraph Road) where the road becomes 6 lanes. Then the road junctions with Interstate 97 near Hanover and reduces down to 4 lanes before crossing MD 2. Between Glen Burnie and Jacobsville, MD 100 serves as a bypass for MD 177, and has interchanges with MD 10 and MD 607.The road ends by merging back into MD 177. HistoryMaryland Route 100 began in the 1970s as two separate roads, both having the MD 100 designation.  The first was known as the Mountain Road Extension, stretching between Governor Ritchie Highway and the old Maryland Route 3, now Interstate 97.  The second was built as a short spur between the newly constructed Interstate 95 and US 1 in Elkridge, Maryland.  The eastern section, originally known as the Mountain Road Bypass, was constructed east of Ritchie Highway in the late 1970s.  MD 100 was completed west of I-97 to I-95, thereby connecting the two roads, in 1994, but it was not completed in its entirety to US 29 until November 1998.  A portion of the route between Exit 1B-C and Exit 2 was constructed earlier than the rest as an at-grade boulevard, on the right-of-way of the future eastbound lanes; this section was eventually upgraded.  The construction of the route near Lake Waterford Road severed the original road between Baltimore and Annapolis: the Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard, signed in part as MD 648.  The physical road ends at a pair of dead ends on either side of the right-of-way; MD 648 follows Lake Waterford Road between Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard and MD 177 before rejoining its original path.The route is part of the Baltimore Outer Beltway, a 3/4 circular beltway designed to provide a route parallel to the Baltimore Beltway.  MD 100 represents the major portion that was built; US 29 between MD 100's terminus and US 29's own northern terminus at Maryland Route 99, four miles (6 km) in length, is another portion.  The Outer Beltway was projected beyond MD 99 to run through Howard and Baltimore Counties and intersect MD 140, Interstate 83, US 1, and Interstate 95 before terminating at US 40 northeast of Baltimore.

Maryland Route 2  Maryland Route 2 is the longest state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.    The   route runs from Solomons Island in Calvert County north to an intersection with U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 40 Truck (North Avenue) in Baltimore. The route runs concurrent with Maryland Route 4 through much of Calvert County along a four-lane divided highway known as Solomons Island Road, passing through rural areas as well as the communities of Lusby, Port Republic, Prince Frederick, and Huntingtown. In Sunderland, MD 2 splits from MD 4 and continues north as two-lane undivided Solomons Island Road into Anne Arundel County, still passing through rural areas. Upon reaching Annapolis, the route runs concurrent with U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 301 around the city. Between Annapolis and Baltimore, MD 2 runs along the Governor Ritchie Highway (also known as the Ritchie Highway), a multilane divided highway that heads through suburban areas of businesses and residences, passing through Arnold, Severna Park, Pasadena, Glen Burnie, and Brooklyn Park. In Baltimore, the route heads north on city streets and passes through the downtown area of the city.The designation MD 2 was in use by 1927 for the road running between Solomons Island and Baltimore. The Ritchie Highway between Annapolis and Baltimore opened in 1939 with the original alignment of MD 2 along Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard becoming Maryland Route 648. By 1960, the route was designated to bypass Annapolis along with US 50 and US 301, resulting in the former route through the city becoming part of Maryland Route 450. MD 4 was routed to follow much of MD 2 in Calvert County by 1975, and in subsequent years this portion of the route was upgraded to become a divided highway. The Ritchie Highway portion of the route was originally the main route between Annapolis and Baltimore until Interstate 97 was completed in the 1990s. Route descriptionMD 2 serves as a north–south route located a short distance to the west of the Chesapeake Bay in Calvert and Anne Arundel counties and in the city of Baltimore in Maryland. In Calvert County, the route runs through mostly rural areas, passing through the communities of Solomons Island, Lusby, Port Republic, Prince Frederick, Huntingtown, Sunderland, and Owings. Between Solomons Island and Sunderland, the route runs concurrent with Maryland Route 4. In Anne Arundel County, MD 2 runs through rural areas of the southern part of the county before reaching the Annapolis area, where it shares a concurrency with the John Hanson Highway. From Annapolis, the route heads through suburban areas in the northern part of Anne Arundel County as the Ritchie Highway, passing through Arnold, Severna Park, Pasadena, Glen Burnie, and Brooklyn Park. It continues north into Baltimore, where it heads toward its terminus north of the downtown area.    At  , it is the longest state highway in Maryland.    Calvert County Maryland Route 2 heads north on Solomons Island Road, a two-lane undivided road with a speed limit of   in Solomons Island, Calvert County from an intersection with Lore Road and an off-ramp from northbound Maryland Route 4 known as Maryland Route 2G.   A short distance later, a portion of Maryland Route 765 called MD 765R continues north along Solomons Island Road, while MD 2 merges onto MD 4 to form a concurrency with that route on a four-lane   divided highway a short distance north of where MD 4 crosses the Patuxent River over the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge. Upon merging with MD 4, the road continues north as Solomons Island Road, passing commercial areas to the east and a U.S. Navy Recreation Center to the west. It continues north-northeast into wooded areas as a   road, with MD 765 running a short distance to the east of the road.   This portion of the road, also known as the Louis L. Goldstein Highway in honor of Louis L. Goldstein, a former Comptroller of Maryland, intersects with Maryland Route 760 (Rousby Hall Road).

Maryland State Highway Administration,  , 2004  Past the I-95 interchange, MD 2 heads through the Federal Hill neighborhood through areas of rowhomes as a two-lane street with a   speed limit.    At the intersection with Montgomery Street, MD 2 splits into another one-way pair with the northbound direction running east on Montgomery Street and then turning north on Light Street, intersecting MD 2 Truck (Key Highway) and passing by the Maryland Science Center, and the southbound direction following Hughes Street to Hanover Street. Along this one-way pair, the route carries one lane in each direction with the exception of Light Street, where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light Street and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits into another one-way pair with northbound MD 2 running along three-lane Calvert Street and southbound MD 2 running along four-lane St. Paul Street.   The route crosses many streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street. The one-way pair passes by Mercy Medical Center before coming to U.S. Route 40. Calvert Street passes under US 40 (the Orleans Street Viaduct) while St. Paul Street intersects US 40 as it follows the one-way pair of Franklin Street westbound and Mulberry Street eastbound. Past US 40, the route heads away from the downtown area and passes more rowhomes. It comes to an interchange with Interstate 83 (Jones Falls Expressway) and crosses over the Northeast Corridor rail line adjacent to Penn Station.  Past the train station, MD 2 intersects the southern terminus of Maryland Route 25, which follows a one-way pair along eastbound Lanvale Street (carrying the southbound direction) and westbound Lafayette Avenue (carrying the northbound direction), before it comes to its northern terminus at U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 40 Truck (North Avenue).  In Baltimore, the daily traffic counts on MD 2 range from a high of 58,375 vehicles along Light Street near the Inner Harbor to a low of 6,075 vehicles along Hanover Street in the Federal Hill neighborhood in 2005.  HistoryThe designation MD 2 was first used by 1927 for the road running between Solomons Island and Baltimore. The route headed north through Calvert County and into Anne Arundel County, where it headed through Annapolis on what is now MD 450. From there, the route followed present-day MD 648 north to Glen Burnie before continuing north on its present alignment toward downtown Baltimore.  In 1939, the four-lane Ritchie Highway, named for former Maryland Governor Albert C. Ritchie, was built between Annapolis and Baltimore and MD 2 was rerouted to this road.        The former alignment of MD 2 along Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard between Annapolis and Glen Burnie was designated MD 648 by 1940.  Throughout the mid 20th-century, a commercial district developed along MD 2 in Glen Burnie, which included several car dealerships and the Harundale Mall.  MD 2 was routed to bypass Annapolis along with US 50 and US 301 on a limited-access highway by 1960, with the former alignment through Annapolis being designated a part of MD 450.    By 1975, MD 4 was routed to be concurrent with MD 2 from north of Solomons Island, where it would cross the Patuxent River on the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge that was completed in January 1978, to Sunderland.     Also by this time, the route was widened into a divided highway between Prince Frederick and Sunderland and from the South River to US 50/US 301.  The divided highway portions of MD 2 were further extended by 1983, with widening occurring between Port Republic and Prince Frederick and between MD 214 and the South River.    By the 1990s, MD 2/MD 4 was dualized from the southern spilt north of Solomons Island up to Port Republic.    The Ritchie Highway was originally the main route between Baltimore and Annapolis prior to the completion of Interstate 97 in 1995.     Originally, MD 10 was intended to provide a limited-access route between Baltimore and Annapolis, but this route was not completed south of Pasadena after it was deemed that an alternative freeway along the Maryland Route 3 corridor (present-day I-97), which required less destruction of residences and businesses, should be built.      In 2010, a project improved the intersection of MD 2-4 and MD 231 in Prince Frederick.     This project is a prelude to a larger project to expand MD 2-4 to six lanes between MD 765 south of Prince Frederick and Stoakley Road north of Prince Frederick.

The route runs east from MD 2 (Hanover Street) on McComas Street, paralleling I-95. From McComas Street, at exit 55 of Interstate 95 just west of the Fort McHenry Tunnel, the route continues onto Key Highway and heads north and west to Light Street (MD 2), mostly paralleling the Northwest Harbor and serving the piers on the harbor. Maryland State Highway Administration,  , 2004 The road was laid out to a width of 160 feet (50 m) from Light Street to Locust Point in the early 1910s, providing better access to the new city-owned piers in preparation for increased trade via the Panama Canal and existing steamship lines to Europe. It was named Key Highway because it was originally planned to extend to Fort McHenry, near where Francis Scott Key wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner."  However, the extension of the road to the fort was never built. A rail line  ran the length of Key Highway, connecting to the tracks in Pratt Street via Light Street. A two-lane extension of the highway and rail line was built in 1930,  branching off the old route east of Ludlow Street and running south under Fort Avenue to McComas Street.   The short portion of the old road east of the extension is now East Key Highway; the rail tracks have been removed.

Maryland gubernatorial election, 2006    The Maryland gubernatorial election of 2006 was held on November 7, 2006. It was a race for the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Maryland. The winning candidates -- Martin O'Malley and Anthony G. Brown, who defeated the incumbent Gov. Robert Ehrlich and running mate Kristen Cox -- were elected to serve from 2007 to 2011. Democratic primary Candidates  Martin O'Malley, Mayor of Baltimore   CampaignMartin O'Malley, the Mayor of Baltimore, and Doug Duncan, the Montgomery County Executive, emerged as the two Democratic candidates for Governor in late 2005. Early polling indicated that O'Malley would have the upper edge in both the Democratic primary and the general election, with a solid lead over Duncan in the primary and a several point lead over Ehrlich in the general.   As the gubernatorial campaign intensified, Doug Duncan dropped out of the race, citing the fact that he had been diagnosed with clinical depression. In the same announcement, Duncan threw his support behind O’Malley and declined to seek another office in the fall.  O'Malley then became the presumed Democratic nominee for Governor, as no other candidate opposed him in the primary election.Mayor O'Malley selected Anthony G. Brown, a black State Delegate from Prince George's County and a veteran of the Iraq War, as his running mate. Results        Republican primary Candidates  Bob Ehrlich, incumbent Governor of Maryland   CampaignGovernor Ehrlich opted to seek a second term as Governor, and did not face any opposition at any point in the Republican primary. When Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele opted to run for Senate instead of seeking a second term on Ehrlich’s gubernatorial ticket, Ehrlich named Maryland Secretary of Disabilities Kristen Cox, who was blind, as his running mate  and was renominated by his party for a second term. Results        General election Candidates  Martin O'Malley, Mayor of Baltimore (D) Bob Ehrlich, incumbent Governor of Maryland (R) Ed Boyd, temporary employment agency recruiter (G) Christopher A. Driscoll (P)   CampaignElected to his first term in 2002, incumbent Republican Governor Bob Ehrlich ran for a second term as Governor, opposed by the Democratic nominee, Martin O'Malley, the Mayor of Baltimore. Both candidates emerged from uncontested primary elections and a contentious election season began.Early in the campaign, Ehrlich boasted decent approval ratings from Maryland citizens, with a Gonzalez Research poll taken during October 2005 showing him with a 49% approval rating.  and a Baltimore Sun poll from November 2005 giving the Governor a 50% approval and a 33% disapproval.  However, the unpopularity of the national Republican Party and President George W. Bush dragged Ehrlich’s re-election chances down. Ehrlich launched attack ads that hit O'Malley on crime in Baltimore under his tenure as Mayor, calling the murder rate in Baltimore "awful" and "an embarrassment to the state of Maryland."  O'Malley countered with one television ad that featured testimonials from local community leaders, Howard County Executive James N. Robey, Baltimore County Executive James T. Smith, Jr.  and another ad that attacked Ehrlich for breaking his promise to end parole for violent criminals. The Washington Post and The Washington Times both endorsed Ehrlich in his bid for re-election, with the Times praising Ehrlich’s "brand of moderate conservatism that offers a refreshing contrast" to the state's historically Democratic leanings  and the Post called him "a generally proficient, pragmatic governor" and praised him for "successes on transportation, the environment and education." In turn, the Baltimore Sun endorsed O'Malley, saying, "the progress under the mayor’s tenure is clear and irrefutable," and that he addressed "rising crime, failing schools and shrinking economic prospects."  O'Malley also called upon the praise given to him by TIME Magazine when they named him one of the country's "Top 5 Big City Mayors."

Maryland, United States 
Western Maryland Railway  The Western Maryland Railway   was an American Class I railroad which operated in Maryland, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. It was primarily a coal hauling and freight railroad, with a small passenger train operation. The WM became part of the Chessie System in 1973 and ceased operating its lines in 1983 when it was merged into the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  HistoryOn May 27, 1852, the Maryland General Assembly granted a charter to the Baltimore, Carroll & Frederick Rail Road to build a line from Baltimore northwest through Westminster, west toward Hagerstown, Maryland. The name of the enterprise was soon changed to Western Maryland Rail Road (WM). The line was opened as far as Union Bridge in November 1862, and it was seized briefly by the Union army during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Construction resumed in 1868. The line reached Hagerstown in 1872 and was extended a few miles to a connection with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal at Williamsport in 1873.         In 1881, WM leased a line north to Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, and in 1886 established a connection there with a predecessor of the Reading Company (RDG). Also in 1886, WM gained a branch north from Hanover to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; that line was soon extended southwest from Gettysburg to meet WM's main line at Highfield, Maryland. The main line was extended from Williamsport and Big Pool, Maryland, and across the Potomac River to Cherry Run, West Virginia, where it connected with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O). B&O, WM, and RDG joined forces to operate a through freight route between Cumberland, Maryland and Allentown, Pennsylvania, via Harrisburg.   WM's stock was largely owned by the city of Baltimore; the city also held its mortgage bonds. By the turn of the century WM's debt to Baltimore was substantial, and the city was seeking a buyer for the railroad. Bids were submitted in 1902. The Fuller Syndicate, the company representing George Gould, was the lowest bidder but guaranteed full payment of WM's debt, extension west to Cumberland, and creation of a major tidewater terminal at Baltimore.      On May 7, 1902, the city accepted the Fuller Syndicate's offer. WM immediately built the marine terminal, Port Covington, and began construction westward along the Potomac (where all the good locations had been taken by the B&O, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the National Road). The line reached Cumberland in 1906. There it met the Cumberland & Piedmont Railway, which with the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway (WVC&P), another Gould railroad, formed a route southwest from Cumberland through Elkins to Durbin and Belington, West Virginia. In 1907, Gould acquired control of the George's Creek and Cumberland Railroad (GC&C), which had a line from Cumberland north through the Cumberland Narrows.   B&O and RDG had broken their traffic agreement with WM in 1902, with the result that coal from Gould's WVC&P bypassed the WM and went instead over trackage owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), which at the time controlled B&O. The rest of Gould's empire was in trouble as well, and in 1908 the WM entered receivership, as did the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway and the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. The Western Maryland Railway took over the WM at the beginning of 1910 and immediately began construction of an   extension northwest from Cumberland to a connection with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad at Connellsville, Pennsylvania. When the Gould empire collapsed, John D. Rockefeller acquired control of the WM. Because the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) merger plan on 1921 grouped WM with B&O, B&O bought Rockefeller's WM interest in 1927 and soon increased its WM holdings to 43 percent. Frank Taplin, who controlled the Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway (P&WV), protested B&O's action. The ICC charged B&O with violating antitrust laws — in its effort to carry out the ICC merger plan. PRR interests acquired the P&WV in 1929 and offered to purchase WM, but B&O refused to sell, eventually placing its WM holdings in a nonvoting trust. In 1944, WM acquired the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad, a short coal railroad out of Cumberland. WM began dieselization in 1949, starting with the eastern end of the system, farthest from the coalfields it served. Passenger service — which consisted of coach-only local trains — lasted barely long enough to be dieselized. As merger plans formulated, WM could see its traffic disappear. The planned merger of the New York Central Railroad (NYC) and the PRR (the ill-fated Penn Central) could throw traffic from the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (part of the NYC system) onto the PRR. The Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W) could easily reroute traffic from the P&WV onto N&W lines right to Hagerstown. WM decided to forsake independence and join the B&O-Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) — after all, B&O was almost half owner of WM. B&O and C&O applied to control WM, and the ICC approved their bid in 1967.     There was little evidence of the C&O-B&O control until 1973, when the Chessie System was incorporated to own C&O, B&O, and WM. In 1973, WM applied to abandon 125 miles of main line from Hancock, Maryland to Connellsville, Pennsylvania. WM's single track paralleled B&O's double-track line and had easier grades and better clearances, but the expense of maintaning the line and building connecting lines outweighed any savings that might result in lower operating costs. That same year, WM's Port Covington coal terminal was abandoned in favor of B&O's newer pier in Baltimore. Gradually, B&O absorbed WM's operations, and in late 1983, B&O officially merged the WM.  The B&O itself merged with the C&O in 1987, which itself became part of CSX Transportation. LegacyMuch of the original Western Maryland line west of Big Pool has been abandoned including the   summit of the Allegheny Mountains and the Eastern Continental Divide near Deal, Pennsylvania. In addition to CSX, portions of the former WM are now operated by Durbin & Greenbrier Valley Railroad, the Maryland Midland Railway (MMID), Western Maryland Scenic Railroad and York Railway. Other portions are now rail trails.  A portion of the former WM right of way within the city of Baltimore is now used by the Baltimore Metro Subway.In Allegany County, Maryland, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park includes the Western Maryland Railroad Right-of-Way, Milepost 126 to Milepost 160, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

Maryland Route 450  Maryland Route 450 (MD 450) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway runs   from U.S. Route 1 Alternate (US 1 Alternate) in Bladensburg east to US 50, US 301, and MD 2 near Annapolis.  MD 450 is the original alignment of US 50 in Prince George's and Anne Arundel Counties.  The state highway was assigned to sections of old US 50 in the 1950s as US 50 was gradually moved to the limited-access John Hanson Highway. Route description MD 450 begins at an intersection with US 1 Alternate in Bladensburg.  The state highway heads east as Annapolis Road through Bladensburg, passing through an interchange with MD 201, a wye intersection with MD 202, and an interchange with the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  MD 450 heads into Landover Hills, where the highway meets MD 410 and its interchange with the Capital Beltway, then crosses the Amtrak Northeast Corridor immediately after a partial interchange with MD 564.  The state highway continues east through Lanham, where the road intersects MD 704 and MD 193.  After crossing CSX's Popes Creek Subdivision, MD 450 crosses MD 197 in Bowie.  The state highway joins MD 3 in a concurrency on the east side of Bowie; the two highways cross the Patuxent River together on the Priest Bridge into Anne Arundel County.Shortly after the bridge, MD 450 separates from MD 3 and heads east as Defense Highway through Crofton, where the highway intersects MD 424.  The state highway continues east through a hilly area where the highway passes under I-97.  MD 450 continues east into Annapolis, where the highway meets MD 178 adjacent to the Annapolis Mall.  After an interchange with US 50 and US 301, the state highway continues into Annapolis as West Street.  MD 450 meets MD 2 on the west side of the city then intersects MD 435 and MD 387 at Westgate Circle.  The state highway passes through Church Circle, from which the highway continues as College Avenue.  After intersecting the southern terminus of MD 70, MD 450 turns north onto King George Street.  The state highway follows the edge of the campus of the United States Naval Academy northwest and then northeast after the junction with the other end of MD 435.  MD 450 crosses the Severn River on the Naval Academy Bridge and meets MD 648 on the other side.  The state highway, now following Governor Ritchie Highway, turns to the northwest before reaching its eastern terminus at an interchange with US 50, US 301, and MD 2.   HistoryMD 450 is the old alignment of US 50 between Bladensburg and Annapolis.  The portion east of downtown Annapolis was also once part of MD 2.  MD 450 was assigned to the highway it follows as sections of John Hanson Highway were completed in the 1950s.

Maryland Route 4  Maryland Route 4 (MD 4) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway runs   from MD 5 in Leonardtown north to Southern Avenue at the Washington, D.C. border, past which the highway continues as Pennsylvania Avenue.  MD 4 is a major commuter route in Southern Maryland, connecting Washington and suburbs in Prince George's County, Anne Arundel County, and Calvert County.  MD 4 also connects residential communities in southern Calvert County with employment centers in St. Mary's County, including Naval Air Station Patuxent River.  In conjunction with U.S. Route 301 (US 301) and MD 2, MD 4 also provides interregional connections with Baltimore and Annapolis, respectively.  MD 4 is part of the National Highway System between MD 235 in California and its northern terminus.   MD 4 heads east from Leonardtown as St. Andrew's Church Road and then Patuxent Beach Road east of MD 235.  The state highway crosses the Patuxent River on the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge between California and Solomons, then joins MD 2 north through Prince Frederick.  At  , MD 2/MD 4 is the longest state-numbered highway concurrency in Maryland.   MD 4 and MD 2 separate at Sunderland, with MD 4 heading northwest as Southern Maryland Boulevard to Bristol, Maryland.  In Bristol in Anne Arundel County, MD 4 continues as the Stephanie Roper Highway to a second crossing of the Patuxent River near Upper Marlboro.  In Prince George's County at Water Street, the state highway heads west as Pennsylvania Avenue toward Washington.MD 4 is one of the original Maryland state highways.  The state highway followed roughly its present alignment through Prince George's County, then headed east through Anne Arundel County along what is now MD 408.  In the 1960s, MD 4 took over MD 416 (Southern Maryland Boulevard) southeast to Sunderland and joined MD 2 all the way to Solomons.  After the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge opened in the late 1970s, MD 4 was extended west from Solomons to Leonardtown.  MD 4 has been upgraded to a divided highway for most of its length, beginning in the early 1960s from Washington, reaching Solomons in the mid 1980s, and expected to continue into St. Mary's County in the 2010s. Route description St. Andrew's Church Road and Patuxent Beach RoadMD 4 begins at an intersection with MD 5 (Point Lookout Road) in Leonardtown.  The state highway heads east as St. Andrew's Church Road, a two-lane road with a speed limit of   through a mix of forest and farmland.  After intersecting Indian Bridge Road, which becomes MD 471 closer to Great Mills, MD 4 turns northeast and passes St. Andrew's Church.  The state highway crosses the St. Mary's River adjacent to St. Mary's River State Park and passes by residential subdivisions before intersecting MD 235 (Three Notch Road) in California.  MD 4 continues northeast as Patuxent Beach Road, a controlled access two-lane highway through scattered residential subdivisions.  The state highway crosses Kingston Creek and intersects two old segments of Patuxent Beach Road.  The speed limit drops to   as MD 4 begins to cross the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge.  The bridge crosses Town Creek before curving to the northeast over the Patuxent River.  After an exit for Solomons, the state highway is joined by MD 2 (Solomons Island Road) in a long concurrency through Calvert County that is often referenced as MD 2-4.   Solomons Island RoadShortly after the concurrency begins, MD 2-4 expands to a four-lane controlled-access divided highway passing through a mix of shopping centers and residential subdivisions.  The state highway is closely paralleled on the east by the old alignment, MD 765 (H.G. Trueman Road), from the beginning of the concurrency to the intersection with Dowell Road.  Beyond Dowell Road, MD 765 heads further away from MD 2-4, which becomes surrounded by forest as the speed limit increases to  .  As the state highway approaches Lusby, the highway intersects Southern Connector Boulevard as well as Coster Road and Mill Bridge Road.  MD 2-4 turns northeast to meet the northern end of MD 760 (Rousby Hall Road), then turns north to pass the western end of MD 497 (Cove Point Road).  After MD 2-4 turns northwest beyond Lusby, the divided highway intersects MD 765.  MD 765 south (H.G. Trueman Road) leads to Calvert Cliffs State Park, while MD 765 north (Pardoe Road) provides access to Sollers Wharf Road.  After crossing Johns Creek and passing Nursery Road, the state highway passes Calvert Cliffs Parkway, which leads to the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, and Flag Ponds Parkway, which provides access to Flag Ponds Nature Park. After crossing Quaker Swamp (Woodland Branch), MD 2-4 continues northwest through St. Leonard, where the old alignment splits to the east as MD 765 (St. Leonard Road). The state highway turns north and intersects Ball Road, which heads west to Mutual, and Calvert Beach Road, which heads east toward the twin beach communities of Calvert Beach and Long Beach.  MD 2-4 turns northwest through Port Republic, where the divided highway meets the northern end of the St. Leonard Road section of MD 765 and intersects MD 264 (Broomes Island Road).  MD 2-4 continues northwest without access controls, with scattered residences and businesses lining the highway.  The divided highway passes MD 506, then the next iteration of MD 765 (Main Street) splits to the east to serve Prince Frederick.  After passing Westlake Boulevard, the speed limit drops to   and the highway becomes lined with shopping centers.  MD 2-4 intersects MD 231 (Hallowing Point Road), then turns north to intersect the northern end of MD 765 and cross the west end of MD 402 (Dares Beach Road).  Beyond the intersection with Stoakley Road, the speed limit increases to   and the state highway continues north through scattered residences and businesses.  After intersecting the west end of MD 263, MD 2-4 crosses Hunting Creek and enters Huntingtown.  The old alignment splits to the west as MD 524 (Old Town Road), which leads to MD 521 (Hunting Creek Road).  MD 2-4 passes Huntingtown High School and meets the northern end of MD 524.  After intersecting Pond Woods Road, the divided highway continues straight north to the end of the MD 2-MD 4 concurrency in Sunderland.   Southern Maryland BoulevardAs MD 2 heads northeast toward Annapolis, MD 4 veers northwest as Southern Maryland Boulevard and immediately intersects MD 262 (Lower Marlboro Road).  The state highway continues as a four-lane divided highway with a speed limit of   through a mix of farms and residential subdivisions through Chaneyville, where the highway passes Chaneyville Road and Mount Harmony Road, the latter being the old alignment of MD 260. MD 4 turns north and enters the village of Dunkirk, where the highway passes shopping centers and Ferry Landing Road. The state highway continues through the residential community of Lyons Creek, where the highway meets MD 260 (Chesapeake Beach Road) at a trumpet interchange that is missing the MD 260 west to MD 4 south movement and simultaneously crosses Lyons Creek.  Entering Anne Arundel County within the MD 260 interchange, MD 4 gains a wide, forested median. The state highway reaches Bristol, where the median narrows and the state highway meets MD 258 (Bay Front Road) at a diamond interchange.  MD 258 provides access to a frontage road, MD 794, which leads to MD 259 (Greenock Road). From the MD 258 interchange for 5.2 miles to the Water St. interchange in Upper Marlboro, Southern Maryland Boulevard and Pennsylvania Ave., as of October 2012, carry the additional name "Stephanie Roper Highway"    Curving northwest past a few off-ramps to the frontage roads and a right-in/right-out interchange southbound with Plummer Lane, the state highway curves to the west and meets the original path of MD 4, MD 408 (Mt. Zion-Marlboro Road), at a diamond interchange at Waysons Corner where its name changes to Pennsylvania Avenue.   Pennsylvania AvenueIn half a mile, MD 4 makes its second crossing of the Patuxent River on Hills Bridge and enters Prince George's County.  Parts of Patuxent River Park, Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary and Patuxent Wetland Park are adjacent to Rt. 4 here at this popular Patuxent River fishing and paddling put-in location.    Immediately after the bridge, it meets Marlboro Pike, the old alignment of MD 4, at a partial interchange that also involves Green Landing Road.  The state highway continues west to intersect US 301 (Crain Highway) at a cloverleaf interchange and cross CSX's Pope's Creek Subdivision.  MD 4 has a diamond interchange with Water Street (unsigned MD 717), which leads to the Prince George's County government offices as well as the Prince George's Equestrian Center and Show Place Arena.  At Water Street, the state highway becomes Pennsylvania Avenue and it crosses the Western Branch of the Patuxent River, then meets Old Crain Highway (at a partial interchange).  The median widens ahead of the partial interchange with Ritchie-Marlboro Road, then closes up ahead of the partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 223 (Woodyard Road), which leads to the historic home Melwood Park.  MD 4 downgrades from a freeway to a controlled access highway at the intersection with Dower House Road and Marlboro Pike, after which the highway expands to six lanes, curves to the northwest, and abuts Andrews Air Force Base.  Access to the military base is provided through the intersection with the Suitland Parkway, which leads to MD 337.  After an intersection with Old Marlboro Pike and Westphalia Road, MD 4 intersects the Capital Beltway at a cloverleaf interchange, where the state highway becomes four lanes again. All but four miles of the previous 54 miles of MD 4 are in the Patuxent River watershed.  The five miles west of the Beltway are in the Oxon Run watershed within the drainage of the Potomac River; the southernmost six miles fall within the Potomac watershed as well.  MD 4 enters a dense suburban area with residential subdivisions and shopping centers upon crossing Forestville Road, which leads to the old alignment Marlboro Pike in Forestville.  After intersecting MD 458 (Silver Hill Road) and Brooks Drive in District Heights, MD 4 turns west through Coral Hills, where the speed limit drops to  .  The state highway passes Cedar Hill Cemetery on the south, then reaches its northern terminus at Southern Avenue on the Washington, D.C. border.  Pennsylvania Avenue continues northwest straight toward downtown Washington.   HistoryMD 4 in Prince George's County was originally the Washington and Marlborough Turnpike, which exited the District of Columbia on Bowen Road, headed east to Forestville, south to Meadows, then east through Upper Marlboro to Hills Bridge on the Patuxent River.        An unnamed road continued east to Solomons Island Road in Lothian.   When the Maryland State Roads Commission was established in 1908, this route became one of the original state roads.  In 1910, the highway was paved from the D.C. border to what is today District Heights, as well as from Hills Bridge to Waysons Corner, where MD 4 meets MD 408 today.     Marlboro Pike from the D.C. line to Hills Bridge and Mt. Zion Road between Hills Bridge and Lothian was fully paved by 1927, which was the same year MD 4 was assigned to the two named roads.     Southern Maryland Boulevard was built between Waysons Corner and MD 2 in Sunderland in 1929 and 1930, and was designated MD 416 by 1933.         Pennsylvania Avenue was extended east out of D.C. to Meadows as a controlled access four-lane divided highway in 1959 and 1960 and was designated MD 4.      Marlboro Pike was assigned MD 4 Business, a designation that was gone by 1970.      Also in 1960, the MD 416 designation was extended south along MD 2 to Solomons.   By 1970, the MD 4 freeway between Meadows and Hills Bridge was complete.   In addition, MD 4 replaced MD 416 down Southern Maryland Boulevard and Solomons Island Road to Solomons, and the divided highway was extended south from Hills Bridge to MD 263.   In turn, MD 408 was placed on what was previously MD 4 between Upper Marlboro and Lothian.   The western extent of MD 408 was rolled back to Waysons Corner by 1980.     MD 2-4 was also expanded to a divided highway south to Port Republic by 1980. The next major change in the routing of MD 4 came in 1977, when the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge was completed.    The St. Mary's County side of the bridge unloaded onto county highways until 1982, when the modern, controlled access Patuxent Beach Road was completed to MD 235.      MD 4 was then extended west from Solomons along Patuxent Beach Road and St. Andrew's Church Road to its present southern terminus in Leonardtown.   MD 2-4 bypassed Port Republic and St. Leonard along a new alignment in 1984.     The bypass of the old alignment between Lusby and Solomons was completed in 1985.     The MD 4 freeway was extended to Bristol in 1993 and the interchange at MD 260 was completed in 2003.       In 2012, Maryland Route 4 between Bristol and Upper Marlboro was renamed the Stephanie Roper Highway.  After the murder of Stephanie Roper, her parents Roberta and Vincent Roper became national leaders regarding victims' rights and services including as founders of the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center, Inc. FutureAs of 2010, construction is underway to improve the intersection of MD 2-4 and MD 231 in Prince Frederick.     This project is a prelude to a larger project to expand MD 2-4 to six lanes between MD 765 south of Prince Frederick and Stoakley Road north of Prince Frederick.     Another future project along MD 4 involves upgrading the highway between MD 223 in Melwood and the Capital Beltway in Forestville to a freeway featuring interchanges at the Suitland Parkway, Dower House Road, and Westphalia Road.     There is also a planning study underway to explore building a new bridge adjacent to the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge and expanding MD 4 to a four-lane divided highway between MD 2 at Solomons and MD 235 in California.

Seal of Maryland The Great Seal of the State of Maryland is the official government emblem of the State of Maryland in the United States.  Its official service is to authenticate acts by the Maryland General Assembly, but it is also used for display purposes at most state buildings. Although the state seal has been changed in design several times throughout history, the current model represents the reverse side of the original seal. HistoryThe first seal was stolen in 1645 by Richard Ingle during a rebellion, but a similar one was sent as a replacement by Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore.  This seal was used except for a period from 1692–1715 until a new one was adopted in 1794.  That seal used republican imagery, such as a woman holding scales of justice on the obverse and on the reverse the motto "Industry the Means, Plenty the Result".   1817 and 1854, symbols of the eagle were used along with a version of the original reverse on the 1854 version.  The original Calvert seal was brought back into use in 1874, and has had various corrections made to its image and meaning in 1959 and 1969. Current seal Obverse side Maryland has the distinction of being one of the few states in the United States, and in the world, to have a dual-sided Seal. The obverse side of the state seal, which was described by statute in 1959 (Chapter 396, Acts of 1959), shows Lord Baltimore as a knight in full armor mounted on a charger with a drawn sword in hand. The caparisons of the horse on which Lord Baltimore is mounted bear his family coat of arms. The inscription on the rim of the seal shows the phrase, Cecilius Absolutus Dominus Terræ Mariæ et Avaloniæ Baro de Baltimore, which translates to "Cecil, Absolute Lord of Maryland and Avalon, Baron of Baltimore" (Chapter 79, Acts of 1969; Sections 13-101 through 13-105 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland). Reverse side The reverse of the seal shows the Calvert arms, described as follows:  Quarterly first and fourth, a paly of six Or and Sable, a bend counterchanged; quarterly second and third, quarterly Argent and Gules a cross bottony counterchanged. Above the shield an earl's coronet surmounted by a barred helm affronté Argent.  The supporters are a plowman (dexter) and a fisherman (sinister), the former holding a spade and the latter a fish; the mantling of ermine (reverse Gules) is entire and surrounds the whole composition. The crest is a crown with two pennants, the dexter Vert and the sinister Or.The state motto, Fatti maschii, parole femine, has its origin in the archaic Italian (the correct spelling today would be "Fatti maschi, parole femmine") and translates as "Manly deeds, womanly words", or more generally, "Strong deeds, gentle words," which is what the Government of Maryland cites officially.  Maryland is the only state with a motto in Italian. The saying is the motto of the Calvert family (the Barons Baltimore) who first founded the Colony of Maryland.  George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore made it his family's motto in 1622 and it appears that the saying was well known in 17th century England.The Latin text encircling the seal, Scuto bonæ voluntatis tuæ coronasti nos, is from verse 12 of Psalm 5 from the Vulgate; it translates to "You have crowned us with the shield of your goodwill." The founding date of 1632 completes the circle.Though the reverse side has been the only part of the seal to be cut and is the part of the seal that is primarily used on official government documents, the obverse side can be found displayed around the state, especially on state government buildings, including the Maryland State House.

Comptroller of Maryland  The Comptroller of Maryland, United States, currently Peter Franchot, is the state's chief financial officer and is also elected by the people for a four year term.  The comptroller is not term-limited.  The office was established by the Maryland Constitution of 1851 due to concern about the potential for fraud and corruption in the administration of the public treasury. The constitutional duties of the office begin with the broad mandate to exercise "general superintendence of the fiscal affairs of the State", which includes collecting taxes and maintaining the general ledger. The Comptroller (or a deputy) countersigns all checks drawn by the State Treasurer (who is elected by the General Assembly) upon the deposits of the State. The Comptroller also prescribes the formalities for transfer of other evidence of State debt and countersigns such papers. In addition, the comptroller's office audits taxpayers for compliance, handles delinquent tax collection, and enforces license and unclaimed property laws. The agency publicizes forgotten bank accounts, insurance benefits and other unclaimed assets of taxpayers. Acting as Maryland's chief accountant, the comptroller pays the state's bills, maintains its books, prepares financial reports, and pays its state employees.

Maryland Science Center   The Maryland Science Center, located in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, opened to the public in 1976. It includes three levels of exhibits, a planetarium, and an observatory. It was one of the original structures that drove the revitalization of the Baltimore Inner Harbor from its industrial roots to a thriving downtown destination. In 1987, an IMAX theater was added, but the museum continued to show its age as the end of the 20th century approached. In 2004, a large addition to the property was opened, and the modernized hands-on exhibits now include more than two dozen dinosaur skeletons. Subjects that the center displays include physical science, space, Earth science, the human body, and blue crabs that are native to the Chesapeake Bay.Maryland Science Center won a 2006 Best of Baltimore award for "Best Place to Take Kids."

Kent Island, Maryland     Kent Island is the largest island in the Chesapeake Bay, and a historic place in Maryland.  To the east, a narrow channel known as the Kent Narrows barely separates the island from the Delmarva Peninsula, and on the other side, the island is separated from Sandy Point, an area near Annapolis, by roughly four miles (6.4 km) of water. At only four miles wide, the main waterway of the bay is at its narrowest at this point and is spanned here by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  The Chester River runs to the north of the island and empties into the Chesapeake Bay at Kent Island's Love Point.  To the south of the island lies Eastern Bay.  The United States Census Bureau reports that the island has   of land area.   Kent Island is part of Queen Anne's County, Maryland and Maryland's Eastern Shore region. The first English establishment on the island, Kent Fort, was founded in 1631, making Kent Island the oldest English settlement within the present day state of Maryland, and the third oldest permanent English settlement in the United States, after Jamestown, Virginia and Plymouth, Massachusetts.   The census-designated places of Stevensville, and Chester are located on the island, along with several other communities, including the fishing community of Kent Narrows, which is located partially on the island. Although all of Kent Island's communities are unincorporated, the census designated places of Stevensville and Chester on the island are both more populous than any of Queen Anne's County's incorporated towns. History Early and ColonialPrior to European colonization, Kent Island was inhabited by Native Americans for nearly 12,000 years.  The island was inhabited by the Matapeake tribe, members of the Algonquian nation who the Matapeake area of Kent Island is named after. Other tribes that inhabited the area and often visited the island included the Ozinie and Monoponson tribes, the latter of which share their name with the Algonquian name for the island, Monoponson. During the 16th and 17th centuries, early explorers of the Chesapeake Bay, including Captain John Smith, were the first Europeans to see Kent Island; however, it wasn't until August 1631 that the island became an English settlement. At that time, William Claiborne, a resident of Jamestown, founded a settlement near the southern end of the island for the purpose of trading with Native Americans, and named the island after his birthplace of Kent, England. The settlement burned down in the winter of 1631-32, but was quickly rebuilt, and in 1634 the settlement included a gristmill, courthouse, and trading station.    Following the formation of the province of Maryland, Claiborne continued to recognize the island as part of his home colony of Virginia while Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore recognized it as part of Maryland. Claiborne was forced from, and returned to the island twice before leaving permanently in 1658, thus effectively ending the disputes.  Virginia's official claims to the island, however, continued until 1776. Industrial RevolutionUntil the early 19th century, Kent Island was used almost entirely for farming of tobacco and corn, however that ended due to the depletion of nutrient rich soil as a result of the lack of crop rotation and poor farming practices. The island's economy went into decline while the soil recovered, with the exception of the port town of Broad Creek. This began to change around the time of the Industrial Revolution. In 1850, the town of Stevensville was founded after the sale of farms owned by James and Charles Stevens, and prospered as a major hub for steamboat travel across the Chesapeake Bay. Stevensville was also the home of a railroad station, known as the Stevensville Train Depot, that was located near the western end of a railroad that carried ferry passengers to other parts of the Eastern Shore. Also during this time, small resorts on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean became common in the area. Such a resort existed at Love Point, to the north of Stevensville. Farming returned to the economy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with farmers growing crops including corn, wheat, berries, and melons. Many of the island's inhabitants worked as watermen in the expanding seafood industry capitalizing on the Chesapeake's supply of Maryland Blue Crab, Rockfish, and oysters.  Twentieth centuryAs roads replaced railroads and steamboats into the 20th century, there was a growing need for a road bridge connecting the two shores of the Chesapeake Bay. In 1952 the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was completed, connecting the island directly to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The bridge completely replaced the steamboat system and also led to further growth of Kent Island and the rest of the Eastern Shore. In 1973, In order to accommodate growing traffic across the bay, the bridge was expanded with an additional span built next to the existing one. Then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s U.S. Route 50 was converted to a freeway across the island. Recent historyIn September 2003, Kent Island was one of the many places in the Chesapeake Bay Area affected by Hurricane Isabel. Local businesses and historic local landmarks were either damaged or destroyed in the storm and the storm surge caused by it. Much of the damage from the hurricane, mostly caused by flooding, took several months to repair.Today, Kent Island is considered a suburb of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and was home to 16,812 residents at the time of the 2000 U.S. Census.  The combined area of the Stevensville and Chester CDPs had 9,603 residents.   Many have relocated from the Washington, D.C. or Baltimore metro areas and continue to commute back there. Stevensville and Chester are also among the most densely populated areas of the Eastern Shore, and the most densely populated in Queen Anne's County, making up 23.67% of its population and only 3.07% of its land area. Historic places  As of 2006, many of the island's historic places have been preserved and are highlighted by the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway and the American Discovery Trail, both of which pass through the island. Several buildings on the island that are still left over from the 19th century and earlier include the Cray House, a rare remaining example of post and plank construction, the old Stevensville post office (left, yellow building in center), Christ Episcopal Church, and the Stevensville Train Depot (right).  Stevensville's historic district along with some of the buildings in the town are on the National Register of Historic Places.  Notable residentsListed are notable people who have lived on Kent Island.  Brock Adams - United States Secretary of Transportation and United States Senator from Washington Elbert N. Carvel - Governor of Delaware William Claiborne - Founder of Kent Island James Earickson - former State Treasurer of Missouri Henry R. Gibson - U.S. representative from Tennessee Theodore N. Lerner - Principal owner of the Washington Nationals Edward "E.J." Pipkin - Maryland state senator   Transportation RoadsThe main mode of transportation on Kent Island, as with most other suburban areas of the United States, is by car. Kent Island's main roads include the U.S. Route 50/U.S. Route 301 freeway, which connects the Island to Central Maryland via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and to the Delmarva Peninsula via the Kent Narrows Bridge.  The island is also served by Maryland Routes 8, 18, and 552. TrailsThe original section of the Cross Island Trail, a walking and biking trail on Kent Island, was built in the late 1990s, as part of Queen Anne's County's portion of the American Discovery Trail.  The full trail was completed in 2001.By the time the Cross Island Trail was completed, growing concern over the safety of pedestrians using the shoulder of Route 8 prompted the construction of a new trail paralleling the road.  When completed, the trail, known as the Kent Island South Trail, will run from Romancoke Pier at the southern end of Route 8, heading north and crossing the road in Matapeake, near Matapeake Elementary and Middle Schools.  From there it will pass through Mobray Park, then over US 50, through Stevensville and will end at the Cross Island Trail in or near Old Love Point Park. Both the Cross Island and Kent Island South Trails are part of a planned trail system for Queen Anne's County, the entire Cross Island Trail and the existing section of the Kent Island South Trail represent the only completed portions of the system. Connections to the Mainland The bridges that currently connect Kent Island to the mainland, or once did, are as follows:  The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, or Bay Bridge, spans the Chesapeake Bay and carries US 50/301 to Annapolis. The Kent Narrows Bridge spans the Kent Narrows and carries US 50/301 to the Delmarva Peninsula. The Old Kent Narrows Bridge, Kent Narrows Drawbridge, or Route 18 Kent Narrows Bridge is a drawbridge that carries MD 18 into Grasonville. It was the predecessor to the current Kent Narrows Bridge and now serves local traffic. An even older automobile bridge once ran across the Kent Narrows and was replaced by the current Route 18 Kent Narrows Bridge. Also in the past, railroad bridges over the Kent Narrows connected the Kent Island portion of the Queen Anne's County Railroad to the mainland.  Local airports on the island serve as another type of connection to the mainland. The largest is the Bay Bridge Airport, located near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Before the construction of the Bay Bridge, ferry services connected the island directly to Baltimore, Annapolis, and the small peninsula on which St. Michaels is located.

New Maryland-Sunbury West  New Maryland-Sunbury West is a provincial electoral district for the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick, Canada. It is currently held by Jack Carr. HistoryIt was created in 1994 as a totally new district taking in large parts of York South and Sunbury as well as small pieces of several other districts.  In the 2006 redistribution of districts, it lost the community of Lincoln due to the rapid growth of both Lincoln and the village of New Maryland, both bedroom communities for Fredericton.Also in 2006, the legislature decided to change the name from New Maryland to New Maryland-Sunbury West to reflect that the district contains much more than just the community of New Maryland.

Lieutenant Governor of Maryland    The Lieutenant Governor of Maryland is the second highest-ranking official in the executive branch of the state government of Maryland in the United States. He or she is elected on the same ticket as the Governor of Maryland and must meet the same qualifications.The current Lieutenant Governor is Anthony G. Brown. HistoryThe position was first created by the Maryland Constitution of 1864. Under that system of government, the lieutenant governor served as president of the Senate and would assume the office of governor if the incumbent should die, resign, be removed, or be disqualified.The state's present constitution, adopted in 1867, abolished the lieutenant governorship. However, the position was re-established by a constitutional amendment ratified on November 4, 1970. Duties and responsibilitiesUnder the 1970 amendment, the Lieutenant Governor "shall have only the duties delegated to him by the Governor." Maryland's lieutenant governorship is thus weaker than the office in several, but not all, other states that have one. For instance, in many states, including Texas, the lieutenant governor is the president of the state's Senate and in California the Lieutenant Governor assumes all of the Governor's powers when he or she is out of the state. In both of those states, as in some others, the lieutenant governor is elected in his or her own right, independently of the state's governor.In practice, Maryland's lieutenant governor attends cabinet meetings, chairs various task forces and commissions, represents the state at ceremonial functions and at events with or without the governor, and advises the governor. If there is a vacancy in the office of the governor, the lieutenant governor becomes the governor. A vacancy in the lieutenant governorship is filled by a person nominated by the governor and confirmed by a majority vote of the General Assembly voting in joint session. List of Lt.

Maryland Route 18    Maryland Route 18 (MD 18) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway runs   from the beginning of state maintenance at Love Point east to MD 213 in Centreville.  MD 18 is the main east–west local highway on Kent Island and east to Centreville, serving the centers of Stevensville, Chester, Kent Narrows, Grasonville, and Queenstown that are bypassed by U.S. Route 50 and US 301.  What is signed as MD 18 is actually a set of four suffixed highways: MD 18A, MD 18B, MD 18S, and MD 18C.  There are also several unsigned segments of MD 18 scattered along the length of the signed portions.What is now MD 18 was first paved in the 1910s from Centreville to Queenstown along with short segments in Grasonville and Chester.  Gaps in the Stevensville–Queenstown highway were filled throughout the 1920s, leaving only a crossing of Kent Narrows to be completed in the early 1930s.  MD 18 between Stevensville and Love Point was constructed in the early 1930s.  The Stevensville–Queenstown highway was designated part of MD 404, while the highways on both ends to Love Point and Centreville were designated MD 18.  US 50 replaced MD 404 when the former highway was extended east of Annapolis in 1949.  When US 50 was relocated as a divided highway between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in the early 1950s, MD 18 was assigned to the bypassed highway.  Since the mid-1980s, several suffixed sections of MD 18 have been created, relocated, or received new designations due to expansion of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway. Route descriptionThe mainline of MD 18 consists of four internally suffixed sections.  MD 18A runs   from Love Point south and east through Stevensville to a roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester.  MD 18B extends   from the same roundabout east through Chester, Kent Narrows, and Grasonville to US 50 in Queenstown.  MD 18S has a length of   between US 50 and US 301 in Queenstown.  MD 18C comprises the easternmost   of the highway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 213 in Centreville. MD 18A's western terminus is at the beginning of state maintenance on Love Point Road just south of the community of Love Point at the northern end of Kent Island.  The state highway heads due south through farmland.  After meeting Old Love Point Road at an acute angle, MD 18A passes suburban subdivisions and Kent Island High School.   Love Point Road, which is unsigned MD 835C, veers southeast to pass through the Stevensville Historic District, which contains the historic Cray House, the Stevensville Bank building, and Christ Church.  MD 18A curves to the southwest as Business Parkway.  The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway ahead of the intersection with MD 8.  MD 8 continues south on the divided highway toward an interchange with US 50 and US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) just east of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge while MD 18A turns east onto Main Street.  MD 18A curves around the southern edge of the Stevensville Historic District, intersecting Love Point Road, which is unsigned MD 759B to the south, and the other end of MD 835C (East Main Street).  The state highway passes Stevensville Middle School, crosses Cox Creek, and passes the Kent Island Shopping Center before reaching its eastern terminus at a roundabout with Castle Marina Road, which is unsigned MD 18H to the south.  MD 18B begins at the same roundabout at which MD 18A has its eastern terminus.  Piney Creek Road, which is unsigned MD 18T, splits to the east as MD 18B curves southeast and crosses over US 50 and US 301.  The state highway curves east again at an intersection with its old alignment, Postal Road, in Chester shortly before an intersection with MD 552 (Dominion Road).  MD 18B continues around the south end of Piney Creek before entering the hamlet of Kent Narrows, where the highway has a direct connection to eastbound US 50 and US 301.  The state highway also has an indirect connection to the westbound freeway via Piney Narrows Road immediately before crossing Kent Narrows on a drawbridge adjacent to the US 50 and US 301 crossing of the strait.  MD 18B continues east through Grasonville, where the highway intersects Chester River Beach Road (unsigned MD 18V) and Nesbit Road (unsigned MD 835K), both of which provide full access to the freeway.  The state highway continues through farmland before reaching its eastern terminus at US 50 (Ocean Gateway) just east of the US 50 – US 301 split in Queenstown.  The two highways meet at a superstreet intersection, so there is no direct access between MD 18B and MD 18S on the opposite side of the intersection.  MD 18S begins at US 50 opposite MD 18B's eastern terminus.  At the intersection with MD 656 (Friels Road) and Outlet Center Drive, which heads into the Queenstown Premium Outlets, the state highway turns north and reaches its eastern terminus at a superstreet intersection with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway).    MD 18C begins at US 301 opposite the eastern terminus of MD 18S.  The state highway heads northeast as Main Street through the town of Queenstown, where the highway intersects MD 456 (Del Rhodes Avenue) and passes near the historic home Bowlingly.  After leaving the town, MD 18C's name changes to 4-H Park Road and the road passes through farmland.  The state highway passes the namesake park of the youth agricultural organization shortly after crossing Reed Creek.  MD 18C passes by the historic home Bachelor's Hope before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 213 (Centreville Road) on the southwestern edge of Centreville.   HistoryThe first sections of MD 18 was paved as three separate state-aid roads within Queenstown and Grasonville by 1915, and between Stevensville and Chester shortly after 1915.    The first section paved as a state road was between Centreville and Queenstown by 1919; there were also short pieces of state road paved in Chester and east of Grasonville by 1921.    The state road in Chester was extended east to Kent Narrows and the state road road near Grasonville was extended west through the village in 1923.   The Stevensville–Chester road and the Queenstown–Centreville road were marked as MD 18 by 1927.   The road from Stevensville to Love Point was started in 1929 and completed to just south of Love Point in 1930.    The highway was extended to its present western terminus by 1933.   Pavement was also laid from the west end of Grasonville to Kent Narrows by 1930.   The east–west highway between Stevensville and Queenstown was finished with the completion of a timber trestle bascule bridge over Kent Narrows.   That highway was marked as MD 404 in 1933; the highways from Stevensville to Love Point and from Queenstown to Centreville remained marked as MD 18. When US 50 was extended to the Eastern Shore in 1949, it was routed along MD 404 to Wye Mills.   The US 50 divided highway started construction in 1950 and was completed between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in 1952, including a new drawbridge over Kent Narrows.     The 1933 bridge over Kent Narrows was dismantled in 1953.   MD 18 was subsequently assigned to old US 50 between Stevensville and Queenstown, following its own alignment except for a concurrency with US 50 and later US 301 over Kent Narrows. Business Parkway was constructed in 1987 as a new alignment and northern extension of MD 8.   MD 18 was extended west to Business Parkway and north on the divided highway to bypass the Stevensville Historic District in 1989; the old alignment was designated MD 835C.  MD 18 also bypassed the center of Chester in 1989 by the construction of an overpass of US 50 and US 301 just west of MD 552, replacing the intersection at Castle Marina Road.   The latter improvement was part of the transformation of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to Queenstown, which was completed in 1991.  The upgrade included a new fixed high-level bridge over Kent Narrows for US 50 and US 301, relegating the 1952 drawbridge to be used only by MD 18.   In 1999, MD 18 was relocated to the north to use a new roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester; the old mainline was designated MD 18R.   The MD 18 – US 301 junction in Queenstown was transformed into a superstreet intersection in 2003, resulting in the splitting of the MD 18C designation; MD 18S was assigned to the highway south of the junction. As part of the reconstruction of US 50 as a six-lane freeway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 404 in Wye Mills, the Maryland State Highway Administration plans to construct an overpass of MD 18 over US 50 in Queenstown.  MD 18 and US 50 would become connected by a pair of right-in/right-out interchanges.  Access to eastbound US 50 would be via a new service road south of US 50 and connections with westbound US 50 would be made through Outlet Center Drive.  As of 2011, the project has not been funded.  Junction list                                        Auxiliary routesMD 18 has 12 unsigned auxiliary routes.  MD 18F, MD 18I, and MD 18U through MD 18Z are in Grasonville.  MD 18G is in Queenstown.

List of Maryland state highways       List of Maryland state highways (2-199)    List of Maryland state highways (200-399)    List of Maryland state highways (400-599)    List of Maryland state highways (600-799)    List of Maryland state highways (800-999)  On the right are segments of the list of Maryland state highways, split into groups of 200.  Maryland state numbered highways are typically referenced as Maryland Route X.  The highways are most often abbreviated as MD X, with MD Route X and Route X being used less frequently.  The longest state highway in Maryland is Maryland Route 2 (MD 2) at  .  The second longest state highway, MD 313 at  , is the state highway that passes through the most counties, five.  The longest state highway entirely within one county is MD 235 at  .  There are several state highways with lengths of less than  , almost all of which are unsigned.  There are several state highways that are split into multiple segments that are signed with the same number but differentiated internally with suffixes.  Almost all state highways are constructed and maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA).  The exceptions include all state highways within Baltimore, select segments of state highways that pass through particular cities and towns, a large portion of MD 295 that is maintained by the federal government, and MD 200, a partially completed highway that is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority.  The lists of state highways also include former state highways, which are shaded in dark gray in each list.Since Maryland does not have a secondary route system or county route system, all state highways are part of the main numerical system between 2 and 999.  That means the same set of numbers is used for both major highways and minor service roads, and almost every number has been used at one time or another.  MDSHA splits segments of highways into primary and secondary highways, but these inventory designations have no bearing on a highway's number.Maryland has two series of geographical clustering of its route numbers, although there are several numbers within the series that do not follow the sequences.  The first sequence runs from 2 to 37.  Numbers 2-6 are assigned to highways in Southern Maryland.  Numbers 7-10 were originally left out.  The sequence continues with 12 on the lower Eastern Shore and heads north through the Eastern Shore and then west through Central and Western Maryland all the way to 37, which was formerly a highway in Garrett County.  The second sequence runs from 38 to 378, starting in Garrett County with 38 and passing through Western Maryland, Central Maryland, Southern Maryland, and then north to south on the Eastern Shore to 378 in Worcester County.Beyond 378, numbers appear to be assigned randomly.  In the early days of the route system, numbers above 378 were assigned individually or in groups in order based on when a highway was built.  More recently, numbers are assigned based on what is available and numerical relations with an existing route, such as an old alignment sharing the same tens and ones digits as the present highway.  For example, MD 732 was assigned to an old alignment of MD 32.Maryland applies letter suffixes to route numbers as a way of organizing groups of related highways, such as a group of old alignments of a major highway, a group of service roads related to the construction of a major highway, or a combination of both.  However, these letter suffixes are only used for inventory purposes and are never signed, with the exception of MD 835A.  Since most routes with suffixes are very short highways of low importance, these highways are rarely signed with route markers.  However, there are several numbered highways with several disjoint segments whose segments are denoted internally with letter suffixes but the segments are signed with the same numerical route marker; examples of these highways include MD 7, MD 18, MD 144, MD 648, MD 675, and MD 765.There is no duplication allowed between U.S. and Maryland state highways unless the two highways are related.  The only signed example of duplicate numbers is MD 222, which is the old alignment of US 222 before the latter was rolled back from Perryville to Conowingo.  Duplication of number is allowed between Interstate and Maryland state highways, but there are no instances where a signed Maryland state highway intersects an Interstate Highway of the same number.

List of Interstate and U.S. highways in Maryland 
Maryland Route 8    Maryland Route 8 (MD 8) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as Romancoke Road, the state highway runs   from Romancoke Pier in Romancoke north to MD 18 in Stevensville.  MD 8 is the main north–south highway of Kent Island in western Queen Anne's County.  The state highway is also the first highway encountered on U.S. Route 50 and US 301 east of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  South of Matapeake, Route 8 is paralleled by the Kent Island South Trail.The section of MD 8 from Stevensville to Matapeake was constructed in 1930 to serve the Annapolis–Matapeake ferry service of the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company.  The highway between Matapeake and Romancoke was constructed in 1938 to serve that company's Romancoke–Claiborne ferry.  The Stevensville–Matapeake road was originally designated MD 404 and was briefly part of US 50 in the early 1950s.  The Matapeake–Romancoke highway was briefly MD 17 before becoming MD 33.  After the Chesapeake Bay Bridge opened in 1952, the MD 33 designation was extended north to Stevensville.  MD 8 replaced MD 33 on Kent Island in 1960. Route descriptionMD 8 begins at the Romancoke Pier in the unincorporated community of Romancoke.  The state highway heads west as two-lane Romancoke Road.  MD 8 curves to the north, intersecting Kent Point Road on a tangent.  The state highway passes a mix of farmland, forest, and residential subdivisions on its way north.  In the hamlet of Normans, the old alignment of MD 8, MD 802 (Batts Neck Road), splits off and later rejoins the present alignment.  MD 8 continues north through Matapeake, where the highway passes Matapeake State Park, the former site of the cross-bay ferry.  Just north of Bay Bridge Airport, the state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway and intersects MD 835A (Thompson Creek Service Road).  Immediately to the north, MD 8 meets US 50 and US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a diamond interchange; this interchange, Exit 37, is the first exit east of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  The highway's name changes to Business Parkway at the interchange, shortly before MD 8 reaches its northern terminus at MD 18.  MD 18 heads north as Business Parkway toward Love Point and east as Main Street toward the Stevensville Historic District and Chester.   HistoryThe first section of present MD 8, from Stevensville to the Matapeake ferry landing, was paved in 1930 to serve the newly-inaugurated Annapolis–Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay in 1930.   The highway was designated as a westward extension of MD 404 in 1933.   The highway from Matapeake to Romancoke was built in 1938 to serve the newly-inaugurated Romancoke–Claiborne ferry across Eastern Bay.    In 1939, the Romancoke–Matapeake highway was designated as a western extension of MD 17, which ran from Claiborne to Easton.   The highway became part of MD 33 in 1940 when old MD 33—now modern MD 17 in Frederick County—and old MD 17 swapped numbers. In 1949, US 50 was extended east of Annapolis and replaced MD 404 west of Wye Mills.  As a result, the highway between Matapeake and Stevensville became US 50.   When the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was completed in 1952, US 50 followed a new divided highway east toward Queenstown.  MD 33 was extended north from Matapeake to MD 18 in Stevensville.   The Romancoke–Claiborne ferry was discontinued by 1954, but MD 33 remained on Kent Island until it was replaced with the MD 8 designation in 1960.    MD 8's interchange with US 50 and US 301 was completed by 1987.  A divided highway, Business Parkway, was completed at the same time from south of the interchange to Love Point Road where MD 18 presently intersects MD 835C north of the Stevensville Historic District.   MD 8's northern terminus moved south to its present location when MD 18 was extended west to Business Parkway in 1989.  Junction list                Auxiliary routeMD 8A is the designation for the   section of Batts Neck Road between MD 8 and MD 802 south of Matapeake. Batts Neck Road continues east from MD 802 as a county highway.   See also      References  External links   MDRoads: MD 8 Photographs of MD 8's termini

Bel Air High School (Bel Air, Maryland)       Bel Air High School is a high school in Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland.  The current building opened in 2009, though the school's antecedents date back to 1815.    History Bel Air High School began as the Harford County Academy when it was formed by an act of the Maryland General Assembly in 1811.  The first school building was a stuccoed stone building built at 24 E. Pennsylvania Avenue, and the name was soon changed to the Bel Air Academy in 1815.  John Wilkes Booth attended the school in the 1850s.  In 1867, while the Bel Air Academy was operating separately, a wooden one-room school house was built on Main Street, which functioned as the main public school of the county.  In 1882, a brick public school was built at 45 East Gordon Street.  The school was renamed the Bel Air Academy and Graded School as the old academy merged with the public school system.  This building housed classes for all students above the third grade. Additions to the building were made in 1897 and 1910.  This building became solely a grade school in 1924 and headquartered the Harford County Board of Education after 1951. Bel Air High School, named thus for the first time, was first formed in 1907, and classes were held at the Gordon Street building and the Pennsylvania Avenue building. The past facility at 100 Heighe Street was opened in 1950, with additional renovations made in 1954, 1968 and 1983. The building had a design capacity of 1,423 students; as a result, 11 "portables" were in use to provide additional classroom space. A new building was scheduled for completion for the graduating class of 2010.The current Bel Air High School building was built in 2009, and has a capacity of 1,668 students. Some new features of the school are its auditorium/stage, cafeteria, library, and multiple sports facilities. StudentsThe student body is mainly Caucasian, with white students representing 81% of the 1,633 students, African Americans 6%, Hispanics 5%, Asians 4%, Two or More Races 4%, American Indians 0-1% and Pacific Islanders 0-1%. Percentages may not total 100 due to rounding.As the suburban population of the Baltimore area has grown significantly during the past two decades, the total student enrollment of the school is steadily rising:     Year   Students  2012 – 1,633 2011 – 1,574 2010 – 1,431 2009 – 1,380 2008 – 1,403 2007 – 1,683 2005 – 1,636 2004 – 1,647	 2003 – 1,573	 2002 – 1,573	 2001 – 1,587	 2000 – 1,555	 1999 – 1,524	 1998 – 1,440	 1997 – 1,383	 1996 – 1,312	 1995 – 1,295	 1994 – 1,272	 1993 – 1,238   Additional photographs   Image:Bel Air High School 2.JPG|Secondary entrance to Bel Air's previous building with tower Image:Bel Air Bobcats.JPG|Sign at the previous entrance to Bel Air High Image:New Bel Air High School.jpg|Bel Air High School under construction, November 2007 Image:Bel Air Feb Construction.JPG|Bel Air High School under construction, February 2008   Notable alumni  Martha Mae Sterbak Breedlove (1956), national equestrian champion   Joseph H.

Walt Whitman High School (Bethesda, Maryland)     Walt Whitman High School is a public secondary institution serving roughly the western part of Bethesda—an unincorporated suburban area of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, in the U.S. state of Maryland. The school is named in honor of the American poet. It is fed into by Thomas W. Pyle Middle School. HistoryThe school opened in the fall of 1962 with 1,418 students. It was built on 17 levels, with a center courtyard and a geodesic dome for its gymnasium until renovation in 1992. A Ford Foundation grant underwrote the design and construction of the dome. In 1964 and 1966, the modern school hosted the 2nd and 4th annual NYSPHSAA state wrestling tournaments. During the first school year, Broadway composer and lyricist Meredith Willson visited the school to assist teacher Monica McMindes with her production of The Music Man, which was his creation.  In 1981, a 1,200-seat auditorium was added to the school. Dr. Daryl Shaw served as the inaugural principal from 1962 until 1975.  Dr. Jerome Marco was principal from 1975 until his retirement in 2004. Currently, the Principal is Dr. Alan Goodwin, who was Assistant Principal for several years before taking his current post.Six elementary schools feed Thomas W. Pyle Middle School, which in turn feeds to Walt Whitman. The elementary schools are Wood Acres, Bannockburn, Burning Tree, Carderock Springs, Bradley Hills, and Bethesda. The Bethesda area is served both by Whitman High School and Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, one of the biggest rivalries in the state. In 2008, Newsweek ranked Whitman at #69 on its "Best High Schools in America" list. In 2009, U.S. News & World Report ranked Whitman as the #44 best school nationwide on its list of "America's Best High Schools."

Shakespeare ClubShakespeare Festival Every other year, Whitman holds a schoolwide "Shakespeare Festival" one day in April honoring Shakespeare's life and his work.  The festival is organized by both students and the school's English department.Productions The Shakespeare Club began producing full, student run productions in the 2007–2008 school year.  The first was The Taming of the Shrew, in March 2008, followed by Macbeth in October 2008 and A Midsummer Night's Dream in March 2009. They performed As You Like It in April 2010, and in May 2011 they put on Twelfth Night.  All's Well That Ends Well was performed in December 2011. Role in popular cultureWalt Whitman High School was the subject of the 2006 best-selling book, The Overachievers. The non-fiction book concerns itself with several students who were members of Whitman's class of 2004, 2005 or 2006. From July 20, 2004 – December 9, 2005, the author, Alexandra Robbins, followed eight Whitman juniors and seniors through their daily lives. It uses the lives of the Whitman students to show pressure in academia and the negative effect in today's society. Robbins is a Whitman alum of the class of 1994.In 2005, in wake of Hurricane Katrina, a Whitman student and her two younger sisters started Project Backpack, an organization which donated backpacks filled with toys to displaced children.  The project exceeded all expectations and received thousands of backpacks which were delivered to the New Orleans victims. To honor their deed, President Bush invited them to light the National Christmas Tree.In 2006, five Walt Whitman High School Juniors were involved in robbing a Smoothie King in Downtown Bethesda. One of the people involved in the robbery was Highly recruited star linebacker Patrick Lazear. Since the robbery was planned during class, Lazear was forced to transfer to Wheaton High for his senior year and lost over 20 scholarships, while the other four boys were forced to transfer to other schools in the county. The students would become known as the Whitman Five throughout the region, and were ridiculed for receiving sentences that many saw as a slap on the wrist that ranged from 30–90 days.The December 15–22, 2008 edition of U.S. News & World Report, in which the nation's top 100 public high schools were unveiled, featured three Whitman students on the cover.In April 2009, the school was the site for a protest by the Westboro Baptist Church. Seven members of the church traveled to the school in order to protest the sexual orientation of Walt Whitman, for whom the school was named. The students organized a counter protest, in which over 500 Whitman students and alumni participated. The protest was covered by national media. Helen Thomas was scheduled for June 2010 to be the commencement speaker at graduation.  A few weeks before, she was asked to comment about Israel. She replied, "Tell them to get the hell out of Palestine," and that "they should go home" to Poland, Germany, America and "everywhere else". Thomas subsequently issued an apology on her personal web site, but Principal Alan Goodwin said, in an email to Whitman parents, "Graduation celebrations are not the venue for divisiveness." Thomas was subsequently replaced as speaker by Bob Schieffer.  StatisticsIn 2008, Newsweek ranked Whitman at #69 on its "Best High Schools in America" list.

Maryland Route 295 
History of Maryland     The history of Maryland included successive cultures of Native Americans for thousands of years until Europeans began exploring the area, starting with John Cabot in 1498. The first European settlements were made in 1634, when the English arrived in significant numbers and created a permanent colony. Maryland was notable for having been established with religious freedom for Catholics. Like other colonies of the Chesapeake Bay, its economy was based on tobacco as a commodity crop, cultivated primarily by African slave labor, although many young people came from the British Isles as indentured servants in the early years.In 1776, during the American Revolution, Maryland became a state in the United States. After the war, numerous planters freed their slaves as the economy changed. Baltimore grew to become one of the largest cities on the eastern seaboard, and a major economic force in the country. Although Maryland was still a slave state in 1860, by that time nearly half the black population was already free, due mostly to manumissions after the American Revolution. Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp.81–82   Maryland was among the border states that remained in the Union during the American Civil War. Pre-colonial history  It appears that the first humans to arrive in the area that would become Maryland appeared around the 10th millennium BCE, about the time that the last ice age ended. They were hunter-gatherers organized into semi-nomadic bands. They adapted as the region's environment changed, developing the spear for hunting as smaller animals, like deer, became more prevalent, and by about 1500 BCE oysters had become an important food resource in the region. With the increased variety of food sources, Native American villages and settlements started appearing and their social structures increased in complexity. By about 1000 BCE pottery was being produced. With the eventual rise of agriculture more permanent Native-American villages were built. But even with the advent of farming, hunting and fishing were still important means of obtaining food. The bow and arrow were first used for hunting in the area around the year 800. They ate what they could kill, grow or catch in the rivers and other waterways.By 1000 BCE, there were about 8,000 Native Americans, all Algonquian-speaking, living in what is now the state, in 40 different villages. The following Piscataway tribes lived on the eastern bank of the Potomac, from south to north: Yaocomicoes, Chopticans, Nanjemoys, Potopacs, Mattawomans, Piscataways, Patuxents, and Nacotchtanks. The area the Nacotchtank lived in is now the District of Columbia. On the west bank of the Potomac river in what is now Virginia were the related tribes of the Patawomeck and the Doeg. Further west in the Appalachian Mountains, the Shawnee lived near Oldtown at a site abandoned around 1731. On the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake, from south to north, there were the Nanticoke tribes: Annemessex, Assateagues, Wicomicoes, Nanticokes, Chicacone, and, on the north bank of the Choptank River, the Choptanks. The Tockwogh tribe lived near the headwaters of the Chesapeake near what is now Delaware. When Europeans began to settle in Maryland in the early 17th century, the main tribes included the Nanticoke on the Eastern Shore. Early exposure to new European diseases brought widespread fatalities to the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them.  Communities were disrupted by such losses. Early European explorationIn 1498 the first European explorers sailed along the Eastern Shore, off present-day Worcester County.  In 1524 Giovanni da Verrazzano, sailing under the French flag, passed the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. In 1608 John Smith entered the bay. The region was depicted in a map by Estêvão Gomes and Diego Gutiérrez, made in 1562, in the context of the Spanish Ajacán Mission of the sixteenth century.  Colonial Maryland   George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, applied to Charles I for a royal charter for what was to become the Province of Maryland.  After Calvert died in April 1632, the charter for "Maryland Colony" (in Latin Terra Mariae) was granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, on June 20, 1632. Some historians viewed this as compensation for his father's having been stripped of his title of Secretary of State in 1625 after announcing his Roman Catholicism.The colony was named in honor of Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I. Maryland At a Glance. Retrieved on 2007-02-07.  The specific name given in the charter was phrased Terra Mariae, anglice, Maryland.  The English name was preferred due to undesired associations of Mariae with the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana, linked to the Inquisition. As did other colonies, Maryland used the headright system to encourage people to bring in new settlers.  Led by Leonard Calvert, Cecil Calvert's younger brother, the first settlers departed from Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, on November 22, 1633 aboard two small ships, the Ark and the Dove.  Their landing on March 25, 1634 at St. Clement's Island in southern Maryland is commemorated by the state each year on that date as Maryland Day.  This was the site of the first Catholic mass in the Colonies, with Father Andrew White leading the service. The first group of colonists consisted of 17 gentlemen and their wives, and about two hundred others, mostly indentured servants who could work off their passage. After purchasing land from the Yaocomico Indians and establishing the town of St. Mary's, Leonard, per his brother's instructions, attempted to govern the country under feudalistic precepts.  Meeting resistance, in February 1635, he summoned a colonial assembly. In 1638, the Assembly forced him to govern according to the laws of England.  The right to initiate legislation passed to the assembly.In 1638, Calvert seized a trading post in Kent Island established by the Virginian William Claiborne.  In 1644, Claiborne led an uprising of Maryland Protestants. Calvert was forced to flee to Virginia, but he returned at the head of an armed force in 1646 and reasserted proprietarial rule. Maryland soon became one of the few predominantly Catholic regions among the English colonies in North America.  Maryland was also one of the key destinations where the government sent tens of thousands of English convicts punished by sentences of transportation.  Such punishment persisted until the Revolutionary War.The Maryland Toleration Act, issued in 1649, was one of the first laws that explicitly defined tolerance of varieties of Christianity.  It has been considered a precursor to the First Amendment.The founders designed the city plan of the colonial capital, St. Mary's City, to reflect their world view.  At the center of the city was the home of the mayor of St. Mary's City.  From that point, streets were laid out that created two triangles.  Located at two points of the triangle extending to the west were the first Maryland state house and a jail.   Extending to the north of the mayor's home, the remaining two points of the second triangle were defined by a Catholic church and a school. The design of the city was a literal separation of church and state that reinforced the importance of religious freedom.The largest site of the original Maryland colony, St. Mary's City was the seat of colonial government until 1708.  Because Anglicanism had become the official religion in Virginia, a band of Puritans in 1642 left for Maryland; they founded Providence (now called Annapolis). In 1650, the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government.  They set up a new government prohibiting both Catholicism and Anglicanism. In March 1655, the 2nd Lord Baltimore sent an army under Governor William Stone to put down this revolt. Near Annapolis, his Roman Catholic army was decisively defeated by a Puritan army in the Battle of the Severn. The Puritan revolt lasted until 1658, when the Calvert family regained control and re-enacted the Toleration Act.The Puritan revolutionary government persecuted Maryland Catholics during its reign.  Mobs burned down all the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. In 1708, the seat of government was moved to Providence, renamed Annapolis in honor of Queen Anne. St. Mary's City is now an archaeological site, with a small tourist center.Just as the city plan for St. Mary's City reflected the ideals of the founders, the city plan of Annapolis reflected those in power at the turn of the 18th century. The plan of Annapolis extends from two circles at the center of the city – one including the State House and the other the Anglican St. Anne's Church (now Episcopal). The plan reflected a stronger relationship between church and state, and a colonial government more closely aligned with the Protestant church.Based on an incorrect map, the original royal charter granted Maryland the Potomac River and territory northward to the fortieth parallel.  This was found to be a problem, as the northern boundary would have put Philadelphia, the major city in Pennsylvania, within Maryland. The Calvert family, which controlled Maryland, and the Penn family, which controlled Pennsylvania, decided in 1750 to engage two surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, to establish a boundary.They surveyed what became known as the Mason–Dixon Line, which became the boundary between the two colonies.  The crests of the Penn family and of the Calvert family were put at the Mason–Dixon line to mark it.  Later the Mason–Dixon line was used as a boundary between free and slave states under the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The Revolutionary period    Maryland did not at first favor independence from Great Britain and gave instructions to that effect to its delegates to the Continental Congress. During this initial phase of the Revolutionary period, Maryland was governed by the Assembly of Freemen, an assembly of the state's counties. The first convention lasted four days, from June 22 to June 25, 1774. All sixteen counties then existing were represented by a total of 92 members; Matthew Tilghman was elected chairman. The eighth session decided that the continuation of an ad-hoc government by the convention was not a good mechanism for all the concerns of the province. A more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776, they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first state constitution, one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government "...of the people only." After they set dates and prepared notices to the counties they adjourned. On August 1, all freemen with property elected delegates for the last convention. The ninth and last convention was also known as the Constitutional Convention of 1776. They drafted a constitution, and when they adjourned on November 11, they would not meet again. The conventions were replaced by the new state government which the Maryland Constitution of 1776 had established. Thomas Johnson became the state's first elected governor.On March 1, 1781, the Articles of Confederation took effect with Maryland's ratification. The articles had initially been submitted to the states on November 17, 1777, but the ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west. Maryland was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until Virginia and New York agreed to rescind their claims to lands in what became the Northwest Territory.No significant battles of the American Revolutionary War occurred in Maryland. However, this did not prevent the state's soldiers from distinguishing themselves through their service. General George Washington was impressed with the Maryland regulars (the "Maryland Line") who fought in the Continental Army and, according to one tradition, this led him to bestow the name "Old Line State" on Maryland. Maryland's Nicknames      Today, the Old Line State is one of Maryland's two official nicknames.The state also filled other roles during the war. For instance, the Continental Congress met briefly in Baltimore from December 20, 1776, through March 4, 1777. Furthermore, a Marylander, John Hanson, served as President of the Continental Congress from 1781 to 1782. Hanson was the first person to serve a full term as President of the Congress under the Articles of Confederation. From November 26, 1783, to June 3, 1784, Annapolis served as the United States capital, and the Confederation Congress met in the Maryland State House. (Annapolis was a candidate to become the new nation's permanent capital before Washington, D.C. was built). It was in the old senate chamber  that George Washington famously resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. It was also there that the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, was ratified by Congress on January 14, 1784. Maryland, 1789–1849  Quasi-war with FranceAfter the Revolution, the US Congress approved construction of six frigates to form a nucleus of what became the United States Navy. Of the first three commissioned, one was designated for construction in Baltimore's shipyards and was named USS Constellation.Constellation became the first official US Navy ship put to sea.  Almost immediately after getting underway, Constellation was ordered to the Caribbean to protect US interests against the French.  Tensions had increased following the Haitian Revolution and independence in 1804, as European powers attempted to maintain control.  During the Quasi-War, Constellation, under the command of Captain Thomas Truxtun, was forced into two major ship-to-ship naval battles involving the French ship L'Insurgente  and the heavier frigate Vengeance .  With its victories in both encounters, Constellation also achieved the first capture by an American vessel of an enemy ship (L'Insurgente).  Its return to Baltimore was accompanied by joyous celebration and nationwide fame.  The Constellation's incredible speed and power inspired the French to nickname her the "Yankee Racehorse". The War of 1812During the War of 1812 the British conducted raids against cities along Chesapeake Bay, up to and including Havre de Grace. There were also two notable battles that occurred in the state. The first was the Battle of Bladensburg, which occurred on August 24, 1814 just outside the national capital, Washington, D.C. The militiamen defending the city were routed and retreated in confusion through the streets of the city.  After overrunning the confused American defenders at Bladensburg, the British took Washington, D.C. They burned and looted major public buildings (see Burning of Washington), forcing President James Madison to flee to Brookeville, Maryland. The British marched next to Baltimore, where they hoped to strike a knockout blow against the demoralized Americans.  Baltimore was not only a busy port, but the British thought it harbored many of the privateers who were despoiling British ships. The city's defenses were under the command of Major General Samuel Smith, an officer of Maryland militia and a United States senator. Baltimore had been well fortified with excellent supplies and some 15,000 troops. Maryland militia fought a determined delaying action at the Battle of North Point, during which a Maryland militia marksman shot and killed the British commander, general Robert Ross. The battle bought enough time for Baltimore's defenses to be strengthened.After advancing to the edge of American defenses, the British halted their advance and withdrew. With the failure of the land advance, the sea battle became irrelevant and the British retreated.  At Fort McHenry, some 1000 soldiers under the command of Major George Armistead awaited the British naval bombardment. Their defense was augmented by the sinking of a line of American merchant ships at the adjacent entrance to Baltimore Harbor in order to thwart passage of British ships. The attack began on the morning of September 13, as the British fleet of some nineteen ships began pounding the fort with rockets and mortar shells. After an initial exchange of fire, the British fleet withdrew just beyond the   range of Fort McHenry's cannons.  For the next 25 hours, they bombarded the outmanned Americans.  On the morning of September 14, an oversized American flag, which had been raised before daybreak, flew over Fort McHenry.  The British knew that victory had eluded them. The bombardment of the fort inspired Francis Scott Key, a native of Frederick, Maryland, to write "The Star-Spangled Banner" as witness to the assault.  It later became the country's national anthem.   Economic developmentThe American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and flour milling increased in Baltimore. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. The British naval blockade during the War of 1812 had hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered the city's economic growth. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic. Transportation initiativesThe city had a deep water port. In the early 19th century, many business leaders in Maryland were looking inland, toward the western frontier, for economic growth potential. The challenge was to devise a reliable means to transport goods and people. The National Road and private turnpikes were being completed throughout the state, but additional routes and capacity were needed. Following the success of the Erie Canal (constructed 1817-1825) and similar canals in the northeastern states, leaders in Maryland were also developing plans for canals. After several failed canal projects in the Washington, D.C. area, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O) began construction there in 1828. The Baltimore business community viewed this project as a competitive threat. The geography of the Baltimore area made building a similar canal to the west impractical, but the idea of constructing railroads was beginning to gather support in the 1820s.In 1827 city leaders obtained a charter from the Maryland General Assembly to build a railroad to the Ohio River.     The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) became the first chartered railroad in the United States, and opened its first section of track for regular operation in 1830, between Baltimore and Ellicott City.     It became the first company to operate a locomotive built in America, with the Tom Thumb.  The B&O built a branch line to Washington, D.C. in 1835.   The main line west reached Cumberland in 1842, beating the C&O Canal there by eight years, and the railroad continued building westward.   In 1852 it became the first rail line to reach the Ohio River from the eastern seaboard.   Other railroads were built in and through Baltimore by mid-century, most significantly the Northern Central; the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore; and the Baltimore and Potomac. (All of these came under the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad.) Industrial RevolutionBaltimore's seaport and good railroad connections fostered substantial growth during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. Many manufacturing businesses were established in Baltimore and the surrounding area after the Civil War.Cumberland was Maryland's second largest city in the 19th century, with ample nearby supplies of coal, iron ore and timber. These resources, along with railroads, the National Road and the C&O Canal, fostered its growth. The city was a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics and tinplate. The Pennsylvania Steel Company founded a steel mill at Sparrow's Point in Baltimore in 1887. The mill was purchased by Bethlehem Steel in 1916, and it became the world's largest steel mill by the mid-20th century, employing tens of thousands of workers.  Educational institutionsThe United States Naval Academy was founded in Annapolis in 1845, and the Maryland Agricultural College was chartered in 1856, growing eventually into the University of Maryland. Maryland in the Civil War  See also: American Civil War, Origins of the American Civil War and History of slavery in Maryland Maryland's sympathiesMaryland was one of the border states, straddling the North and South. As in Virginia and Delaware, some planters in Maryland had freed their slaves in the twenty years after the Revolutionary War.  By 1860 Maryland's free black population comprised 49.1% of the total of African Americans in the state. After John Brown's raid in 1859 on Harper's Ferry, Virginia (now in West Virginia), some citizens in slaveholding areas began forming local militias for defense. Of the 1860 population of 687,000, about 60,000 men joined the Union and about 25,000 fought for the Confederacy.  The political alignments of each group generally reflected their economic interests, with slaveholders and people involved in trade with the South most likely to favor the Confederate cause, and small farmers and merchants outside the major cities and in western Maryland allied with the Union.The first bloodshed of the Civil War occurred in Baltimore involving Massachusetts troops who were fired on while marching between railroad stations on April 19, 1861.  After that, Baltimore Mayor George William Brown, Marshal George P. Kane, and former Governor Enoch Louis Lowe requested that Maryland Governor Thomas H. Hicks, a slave owner from the Eastern Shore, burn the railroad bridges and cut the telegraph lines leading to Baltimore to prevent further troops from entering the state. Hicks reportedly approved this proposal. These actions were addressed in the famous federal court case of Ex parte Merryman.Maryland remained part of the Union during the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln's strong hand suppressing violence and dissent in Maryland and the belated assistance of Governor Hicks played important roles.  Hicks worked with federal officials to stop further violence. As an illustration of the state's divided sympathies, it is notable that in the 1860 election, Lincoln received only one vote in Prince George's County, a center of large plantations. Marylanders sympathetic to the South easily crossed the Potomac River to join and fight for the Confederacy.  Exiles organized a "Maryland Line" in the Army of Northern Virginia which consisted of one infantry regiment, one infantry battalion, two cavalry battalions and four battalions of artillery.  According to the best extant records, up to 25,000 Marylanders went south to fight for the Confederacy.  About 60,000 Maryland men served in all branches of the Union military. Many of the Union troops were said to enlist on the promise of home garrison duty. To prevent an uprising in Baltimore, a Union artillery garrison was placed on Federal Hill with express orders to destroy the city should Southern sympathizers overwhelm law and order there.  Following the Baltimore riot of 1861, Union troops under the command of General Benjamin F. Butler occupied the hill in the middle of the night.  This was against Washington orders.  Butler and his men erected a small fort, with cannon pointing towards the central business district. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the federal government under threat of force. This fort and the Union occupation persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannon, and a small Grand Army of the Republic monument remain to testify to this period of the hill's history.Because Maryland remained in the Union, it was not included under the Emancipation Proclamation. A constitutional convention was held during 1864 that culminated in the passage of a new state constitution on November 1 of that year. Article 24 of that document outlawed the practice of slavery. The right to vote was extended to non-white males in the Maryland Constitution of 1867, which is still in effect today.During this time, the USS Constellation was flagship of the US Africa Squadron from 1859 to 1861. In this period, she disrupted the African slave trade by interdicting three slave ships and releasing the imprisoned slaves. The last of the ships was captured at the outbreak of the Civil War: Constellation overpowered the slaver brig Triton in African coastal waters. Constellation spent much of the war as a deterrent to Confederate cruisers and commerce raiders in the Mediterranean Sea. The war on Maryland soil   The largest and most significant battle fought in the state was the Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg. The battle was the culmination of Robert E. Lee's Maryland Campaign, which aimed to secure new supplies, recruit fresh men from among the considerable pockets of Confederate sympathies in Maryland, and to impact public opinion in the North. With those goals, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, consisting of about 40,000 men, had entered Maryland following their recent victory at Second Bull Run.While Major General George B. McClellan's 87,000-man Army of the Potomac was moving to intercept Lee, a Union soldier discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed battle plans of Lee's army. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and position his forces based on it, thus endangering a golden opportunity to defeat Lee decisively.The armies met near the town of Sharpsburg by Antietam Creek. Although McClellan arrived in the area on September 16, his trademark caution delayed his attack on Lee, which gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed Longstreet's corps to arrive from Hagerstown and Jackson's corps, minus A. P. Hill's division, to arrive from Harpers Ferry. McClellan's two-to-one advantage in the battle was almost completely nullified by a lack of coordination and concentration of Union forces, which allowed Lee to shift his defensive forces to parry each thrust.Although a tactical draw, the Battle of Antietam was considered a strategic Union victory and a turning point of the war.  It forced the end of Lee's invasion of the North.  It also was enough of a victory to enable President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect on January 1, 1863.  He had been advised by his Cabinet to make the announcement after a Union victory, to avoid any perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union's winning the Battle of Antietam also may have dissuaded the governments of France and Great Britain from recognizing the Confederacy.  Some observers believed they may have done so in the aftermath of another Union defeat.During the war, Maryland's naval contribution, the relatively new sloop-of-war USS Constellation maintained her duty in slave ship interdiction for the Union Navy. Stationed in the Mediterranean, the Constellation actively protected convoys and defended against commerce raiders. 1865–1920  Post-Civil War political developmentsSince Maryland had remained in the Union during the Civil War, the state did not undergo Reconstruction like the states of the former Confederacy. However, as a former "slave state", many Maryland residents struggled to maintain white supremacy over freedmen and formerly free blacks, and racial tensions rose. There were deep divisions in the state between those who fought for the North and those who fought for the South, which were also difficult to reconcile.The whites in the Democratic Party rapidly regained power in the state and replaced Republicans who had ruled during the war.  Support for the Constitution of 1864 ended, and Democrats replaced it with the Maryland Constitution of 1867. That document, which is still in effect today, resembled the 1851 constitution more than its immediate predecessor and was approved by 54.1% of the state's population.  Although the reapportionment of the legislature based on population, not counties, gave greater power to freedmen (as well as to urban areas), the new constitution deprived African Americans of some of the protections of the 1864 document.Over the next several decades, the African-American population struggled in a discriminatory environment. In 1910 the legislature proposed the Digges Amendment to the state constitution. It would have used property requirements to effectively disfranchise many African Americans as well as many poor whites (including new immigrants), a technique used by other southern states of that period, beginning with Mississippi in 1890.  The Maryland General Assembly passed the bill, which Governor Austin Lane Crothers supported.  Before the measure went to popular vote, a bill was proposed that would have effectively passed the requirements of the Digges Amendment into law.  Due to wide public opposition, that measure failed, and the amendment was also rejected by the voters of Maryland.  This was the most notable rejection nationally of a black-disfranchising amendment.  Similar measures had earlier been proposed, but also failed to pass (the Poe Amendment in 1905 and the Straus Amendment in 1909).The businessmen Johns Hopkins, Enoch Pratt, George Peabody, and Henry Walters were philanthropists of 19th-century Baltimore; they founded notable educational, health care, and cultural institutions in that city, which bear their names, including a university, library, music school and art museum. Progressive era reforms In the early 20th century, a political reform movement arose, centered in the rising new middle class. One of their main goals included having government jobs granted on the basis of merit rather than patronage. Other changes aimed to reduce the power of political bosses and machines, which they succeeded in doing.In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and pre-marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from "assisting" voters; initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the illiterate from participating. Although promoted as democratic reforms, the changes had other results sought by the middle class.  They discouraged participation by the lower classes and illiterate voters.  Voting participation dropped from about 82% of eligible voters in the 1890s to about 49% in the 1920s.Other laws regulated working conditions. For instance, in a series of laws passed in 1902, the state regulated conditions in mines; outlawed child laborers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first workers' compensation law.  The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910. The law become a model for national legislation a few decades later. The debate over prohibition of alcohol, another progressive reform, led to Maryland's gaining its second nickname.  A mocking newspaper editorial dubbed Maryland "the Free State" for its allowing alcohol.   Great Baltimore FireThe Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 was a momentous event for Maryland's largest city and the state as a whole. The fire raged in Baltimore from 10:48 a.m. Sunday, February 7, to 5:00 p.m. Monday, February 8, 1904.  More than 1,231 firefighters worked to bring the blaze under control.One reason for the fire's duration was the lack of national standards in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, as well as units from New York, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responded, many were useless because their hose couples failed to fit Baltimore hydrants. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.In the aftermath, 35,000 people were left unemployed.  After the fire, the city was rebuilt using more fireproof materials, such as granite pavers. The World War I eraEntry into World War I brought changes to Maryland.Maryland was the site of new military bases, such as Camp Meade (now Fort Meade), the Aberdeen Proving Ground, which were established in 1917, and the Edgewood Arsenal, which was founded the following year. Other existing facilities, including Fort McHenry, were greatly expanded.To coordinate wartime activities, like the expansion of federal facilities, the General Assembly set up a Council of Defense. The 126 seats on the council were filled by appointment.  The Council, which had a virtually unlimited budget, was charged with defending the state, supervising the draft, maintaining wage and price controls, providing housing for war-related industries, and promoting support for the war. Citizens were encouraged to grow their own victory gardens and to obey ration laws. They were also forced to work, once the legislature adopted a compulsory labor law with the support of the Council of Defense. Maryland in the 20th century  The Ritchie administrationIn 1918, Maryland elected Albert C. Ritchie, a Democrat, governor. He was reelected four times, serving from 1919 to 1934, and is arguably the state's all-time most popular governor.  Handsome and aristocratic, Ritchie was very pro-business. He hired a management firm to streamline government operations and established a budget process controlled largely by economists. He also won approval for a civil service system that had long been sought by reformers, who wanted positions given on the basis of merit and not patronage; reduced the number of state elections by extending legislative terms from two to four years; and he appointed many citizens' commissions to advise on nearly every aspect of government.  State property taxes dropped sharply under Ritchie, but so did state services. A powerful state movie censorship board kept subversive ideas away from the masses. Three times, including 1924 and 1932, Ritchie was a candidate for President of the United States, arguing that Presidents Coolidge and Hoover were hopeless spendthrifts.  Ritchie lost his bid for the Democratic Party's nomination for President in 1932. Despite a large demonstration for support at the convention, Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated and went on the win the election. Ritchie continued to serve as governor until 1935.  The Great Depression, World War II, and aftermathMaryland's urban and rural communities had different experiences during the Depression.  In 1932 the "Bonus Army" marched through the state on its way to Washington, D.C. In addition to the nationwide New Deal reforms of President Roosevelt, which put men to work building roads and park facilities, Maryland also took steps to weather the hard times. For instance, in 1937 the state instituted its first ever income tax to generate revenue for schools and welfare. The state had some advances in civil rights. The 1935 case Murray v. Pearson et al. resulted in a Baltimore City Court's ordering integration of University of Maryland Law School. The plaintiff in that case was represented by Thurgood Marshall, a young lawyer with the NAACP and a native of Baltimore.  When the state attorney general appealed to the Court of Appeals, it affirmed the decision.Because the state did not appeal the ruling in the federal courts, this state ruling under the U.S. Constitution was the first to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme Court decision that allowed separate but equal facilities.   While the ruling was a moral precedent, it had no authority outside the state of Maryland.A hurricane in 1933 created an inlet in Sinepuxent Bay at Ocean City, making the then-small town attractive for recreational fishing.  During World War II additional large defense facilities were established in the state such as Andrews Air Force Base, Patuxent River Naval Air Station, and the large Glenn L. Martin aircraft factory east of Baltimore.In 1952, the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the long Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which replaced a nearby ferry service.    This bridge (and its later, parallel span) increased tourist traffic to Ocean City, which experienced a building boom.  Soon after, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel allowed long-distance interstate motorists to bypass downtown Baltimore, while the earlier Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge allowed them to bypass Washington, D.C.  Two beltways, I-695 and I-495, were built around Baltimore and Washington, while I-70, I-270, and later I-68 linked central Maryland with western Maryland, and I-97 linked Baltimore with Annapolis.  Passenger and freight steamboat transportation, previously very important throughout the Chesapeake Bay and its many tributaries, came to an end in mid-century.In 1980, the opening of Harborplace and the Baltimore Aquarium made that city a significant tourist destination, while Charles Center, the World Trade Center, and the popular Camden Yards baseball stadium were constructed in the downtown area.  Fells Point also became popular.  The historic Annapolis waterfront area, previously a working-class fishing port,  also became gentrified  and a tourist destination.  Baltimore's largest employer, the Bethlehem Steel factory at Sparrows Point, shrunk, and the General Motors plant closed, while Johns Hopkins University and Health Care System took Bethlehem's place as Baltimore's largest employer. There are over 350 biotechnology companies in the state.  The Social Security - Health Care Financing Administration, Bureau of Standards, U.S. Census Bureau, National Institutes of Health, National Security Agency,and Public Health Service have their headquarters in the state.  Metrorail lines were constructed in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, while Baltimore opened its own   Metro Subway as well as the north-south Baltimore Light Rail system.In addition to general suburban growth, specially planned new communities sprung up, most notably Columbia, but also Montgomery Village, Belair at Bowie, St. Charles, Cross Keys, and Joppatowne, and numerous shopping malls, the state's three largest malls being Annapolis Mall, Arundel Mills and the Towson Town Center.  Community colleges were established in nearly every county in Maryland. Large-scale, mechanized poultry farms became prevalent on the lower Eastern Shore, along with irrigated vegetable farming.  In Southern Maryland tobacco farming had nearly vanished by the century's end, due to suburban housing development and a state tobacco incentive buy-out program.  Industrial, railroad, and coal-mining jobs in the four westernmost counties declined, but that area's economy was helped by expansion of outdoor recreational tourism and new technology jobs and industries.   As the 21st century dawned, Maryland joined neighboring states in a new initiative to save the health of Chesapeake Bay, whose aquatic life and seafood industry are threatened by waterfront residential development, as well as by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay, especially from Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River.  In addition, about   of Maryland shore are eroded per year due to the land sinking and rising sea levels.

Maryland Constitution of 1864  The Maryland Constitution of 1864 was the third of the four constitutions which have governed the U.S. state of Maryland.  A controversial product of the Civil War and in effect only until 1867, when the state's present constitution was adopted, the 1864 document was short-lived. DraftingThe 1864 constitution was largely the product of strong Unionists, who had control of the state at the time. The document outlawed slavery, disenfranchised Southern sympathizers, and reapportioned the General Assembly based upon the number of white inhabitants. This provision further diminished the power of the small counties where the majority of the state's large former slave population lived. One of the framers' goals was to reduce the influence of Southern sympathizers, who had almost caused the state to secede in 1861. RatificationThe convention which drafted the document convened on April 27, 1864 and completed their work by September 6.  The constitution was then submitted to the people for ratification on October 13, 1864. It was approved by a vote of 30,174 to 29,799 (50.31% to 49.69%). This was a very controversial result, since the state, though part of the Union, still had many Confederate ties and sympathies. The tally of those voting at their usual polling places was opposed to this Constitution by 29,536 to 27,541. However, the constitution secured ratification after the soldiers' votes were tallied. Soldiers from Maryland serving in the Union Army voted overwhelmingly in favor, 2,633 to 263. Notable featuresBy design, the constitution disenfranchised those Marylanders who had left the state to fight for or live in the Confederacy or who had given it "any aid, comfort, countenace, or support." It also made it difficult for them to regain the full rights of citizenship and required office-holders to take a new oath of allegiance to support the state and union and to repudiate the rebellion. Furthermore, the influence of the small counties which had large slave populations, and tended to have supported secession and to have opposed union efforts during the war, was reduced by basing representation solely on white population. The constitution did emancipate the slaves, but this did not mean equality. The franchise was restricted to "white" males. Additionally, the Maryland legislature refused to ratify both the 14th Amendment, which conferred citizenship rights on former slaves, and the 15th Amendment, which gave the vote to African Americans.Maryland's 1864 constitution created for the first time the position of Lieutenant Governor. The office was held by only one person, Christopher C. Cox, until a 1971 amendment to the 1867 constitution re-created the position. References   Whitman H. Ridgway.

Maryland Route 213  Maryland Route 213 (MD 213) is a   state highway located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the United States. The route runs from Maryland Route 662 in Wye Mills, Queen Anne's County north to the Pennsylvania border in Cecil County, where it continues into that state as Pennsylvania Route 841. The route, which is a two-lane undivided highway its entire length, passes through mostly rural areas as well as the communities of Centreville, Chestertown, Galena, Cecilton, Chesapeake City, and Elkton. MD 213 intersects many routes including U.S. Route 50 near Wye Mills, U.S. Route 301 near Centreville, and U.S. Route 40 in Elkton. It crosses over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal in Chesapeake City on the Chesapeake City Bridge. Maryland Route 213 is designated by the state as the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway between the southern terminus and Chesapeake City with the portion north of Maryland Route 18 in Centreville a National Scenic Byway. In addition, the route is also considered part of the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway between Chesapeake City and Maryland Route 273 in Fair Hill.The route was initially designated as U.S. Route 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established, running from Ocean City to US 40 in Elkton. By 1940, it was realigned to the US 50 corridor between Mardela Springs and Easton, having previously followed Maryland Route 313, Maryland Route 14, and Maryland Route 331 between these two points, and Maryland Route 280 was designated along current MD 213 north of US 40. In 1949, US 50 replaced US 213 south of Wye Mills. The route was then downgraded to MD 213 by 1975, and was subsequently extended to the Pennsylvania border along the alignment of MD 280, whose signs consequently were taken down. Route description Queen Anne's CountyMaryland Route 213 begins at an intersection with Maryland Route 662 (Wye Mills Road) in Wye Mills, Queen Anne's County, heading to the north on College Drive, a two-lane undivided road with a   speed limit.  From the southern terminus, MD 213 is designated by the state as the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway.    The road heads into rural farmland, passing Chesapeake College on the left before intersecting U.S. Route 50 (Ocean Gateway).    Past this intersection, MD 213 continues north on   Centreville Road, passing more farms as well as some residences. The route continues into a mix of woods and farmland before intersecting the northern terminus of Maryland Route 309 (Starr Road). A short distance later, the route interchanges with U.S. Route 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). Past the US 301 interchange, MD 213 continues through more rural areas before entering Centreville, where the speed limit drops to   and it passes some residential and commercial areas. It intersects Maryland Route 18 (4H Park Road).   At this intersection, MD 213 becomes a part of the National Scenic Byway portion of the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway.    Past MD 18, the route continues into residential areas, eventually splitting into a one-way pair with northbound MD 213 following Commerce Street and southbound MD 213 following Liberty Street.   This pairing continues past residences, with the speed limit dropping to  , before heading into the downtown area, where the road intersects Maryland Route 304 (Water Street).   Westbound MD 304 secretly joins northbound MD 213 for a concurrency that lasts until Broadway, where it continues to the west. MD 213 leaves downtown Centreville, with the speed limit increasing back to  . The one-way pair ends and the route continues north on two-lane undivided Liberty Street, passing by residences and some businesses.   At the end of the one-way pair, the route sees an average of 12,912 vehicles daily.  It intersects the western terminus of Maryland Route 305 (Hope Road), and passes by more residences as a   road before becoming   Church Hill Road, which heads north into a mix of woods and farms with some housing developments.    It angles to the northeast and then north through more rural areas, consisting mostly of farm fields with some wooded areas and occasional residences. MD 213 continues in a northeast direction before reaching Church Hill.  Upon reaching Church Hill, the route intersects Maryland Route 19A (South Main Street), which loops to the east of MD 213 to head into the town.  Meanwhile, MD 213 bypasses Church Hill to the west, running through woodland, and intersects the western terminus of Maryland Route 300 (Sudlersville Road).  The route heads back into farmland and intersects Maryland Route 19 (North Main Street), leaving the Church Hill area. MD 213 continues north through a mix of woods and farms. From here, the route turns northwest through more farmland before it passes some residences and businesses near the intersection with the western terminus of Maryland Route 544 (Mcginnis Road).   Past the MD 544 intersection, the road continues through rural areas as a   road, but residences and businesses start to increase. MD 213 passes through Kingstown, where the speed limit drops to   before crossing the Chester River on a drawbridge.  Kent CountyUpon crossing the Chester River, MD 213 enters Chestertown, Kent County, where the route heads northwest on Maple Avenue, a   street through residential areas. It intersects Maryland Route 289 (Cross Street) in the downtown area and turns north onto Washington Avenue at the intersection with Spring Avenue.   Washington Avenue carries MD 213 north through residential neighborhoods and passes by Washington College.  Past the college, the route continues past businesses and intersects Maryland Route 291 (Morgnec Road). Past this intersection, the speed limit increases to   and MD 213 continues through residential and commercial areas.   The road leaves Chestertown and becomes Augustine Herman Highway, which is named for Czech surveyor Augustine Herman.  The speed limit rises to   as the road heads into farmland with residences along the west side of the road. MD 213 intersects Maryland Route 297 (Worton Road) and the speed limit increases to   as it heads past more farm fields. The road turns northeast and intersects Maryland Route 561 (Hassenger’s Corner Road).   It continues through more rural areas, consisting mostly of farms with some wooded areas before reaching Kennedyville, where the speed limit decreases to   and MD 213 passes residences. In Kennedyville, the road crosses over a Maryland & Delaware Railroad line.  Upon leaving Kennedyville, the speed limit becomes   again and it continues back into agricultural areas.

From here, MD 213 continues northwest and west as Lewisville Road through a mix of rural areas and residences before ending at the Pennsylvania border. Here, the road continues north as Pennsylvania Route 841 into Lewisville, intersecting the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 472 just north of the state line.  History The route was originally designated as U.S. Route 213 with the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, running from Ocean City north to US 40 in Elkton.    The route ran along what is now Maryland Route 707 and Maryland Route 346 to Salisbury, where it intersected with its parent route, U.S. Route 13. From Salisbury, US 213 followed the present US 50 corridor to Mardela Springs, where it turned north on MD 313 and followed that route to Eldorado. Here, the route ran along present-day Maryland Route 14 and Maryland Route 331 to Easton, where it continued north along current MD 662 and MD 213 to Elkton.  By 1940, US 213 was realigned between Mardela Springs and Easton to follow the present US 50 corridor, crossing the Choptank River at Cambridge on the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge that opened in 1935.        Also by this time, Maryland Route 280 was designated along present-day MD 213 between US 40 and the Pennsylvania border.  On July 28, 1942, the vertical lift bridge carrying US 213 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, built in 1927, was destroyed when the tanker Franz Klasen struck it. The destroyed bridge was replaced by the current Chesapeake City Bridge, which opened in 1949.    The approaches to the original bridge are now designated as MD 537 and a western extension of MD 285.   In 1949, the route was replaced by U.S. Route 50 between Ocean City and Wye Mills shortly before the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and as a result US 213 no longer crossed US 13.    By 1975, US 213 became MD 213, and the route was extended from US 40 to the Pennsylvania border along the former Maryland Route 280.

Sugarloaf Mountain (Maryland)    Sugarloaf Mountain is a small (1,282 foot; 391 m) mountain and park about 10 miles (16 km) south of Frederick, Maryland, USA. The closest village is Barnesville, located nearly at the foot of the mountain. The peak of this relatively low mountain is approximately 800 feet (244 m) higher than the surrounding farmland. Because of its geological and natural history interest, it was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1969. It is a notable example of an admission-free, privately owned scenic park. HistoryDuring the Maryland Campaign of the American Civil War in 1862, Union forces occupying the summit, which was being used as an observation and signal station, first spotted the Army of Northern Virginia on September 5 as it crossed the Potomac River into Maryland.   The following morning as the small Union force on the mountain began to retreat in the face of the oncoming Confederate Army, they ran into the unsuspecting 1st North Carolina Infantry and a small skirmish ensued.  The Union force was able to escape, but it was later caught by Confederate cavalry at Urbana.  In the early 20th century Chicago businessman Gordon Strong bought substantial land holdings on and around the mountain. In 1925, the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, on commission from Strong, proposed an automobile objective development for the top of the mountain, but that was never carried out.President Franklin D. Roosevelt, briefly considered using Sugarloaf as his Presidential retreat, but he was persuaded by Strong to choose the nearby Shang-Ri-La site on the Catoctin Mountain, which today is known as Camp David. Strong set up a trust fund in 1947 that maintains a trail system and other tourist facilities at Sugarloaf Mountain. The mountain and its immediate environs continue to be open to the public, but they are privately owned by Stronghold, Incorporated. GeologySugarloaf Mountain is an example of a monadnock — an isolated hill or small mountain rising abruptly from gently sloping or level surrounding land. It appears to be either an outlier to the east of the main mass of Catoctin Mountain, or a root remnant of the ancient Appalachian land mass.The bedrock is the Lower Cambrian Sugarloaf Mountain Quartzite, a massive white quartzite interbedded with softer sericitic quartzite, slate, and phyllite.  The formation is divided into upper, middle, and lower members.  TourismSugarloaf Mountain is an area tourist attraction, free of an admission charge, and open to the public. Activities include hiking, rock climbing, picnicking, and sightseeing. The mountain is known to locals for its scenic views.

Hereford Zone, Maryland The Hereford Zone is an area in Northern Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, constituting 20% of all of the land in Baltimore County.  It includes Hereford, Parkton, Monkton, Freeland, Sparks, White Hall, Jacksonville, Upperco, and Glyndon.It is by far the most sparsely populated area in Baltimore County. Strict zoning laws prohibit any planned communities from developing, with large single-family housing lots and agricultural activity predominating.Because of its higher elevation and microclimate, the weather of The Hereford Zone is slightly different from that of the rest of the county.     It is not unusual in the winter for schools in the surrounding areas to be 2 hours late, while the Hereford Zone is closed due to inclement weather.Near the most northern part of the zone in the topmost strip where Baltimore County meets south central Pennsylvania, numerous mini tornadoes and wind storms zip through the fields unfettered by buildings or natural land changes to halt their progress.  The air quality in the area is markedly different from that of the suburbs of Baltimore City to the south.  Both the land elevation as it climbs from sea level to nearly 700' and the absence of smokestack manufacturing combine with the prevailing westerly winds to eliminate the yellow haze associated with low levels of pollution on even the most humid summer days.Hereford High School, Parkton has the only agriscience program in the county along with Hereford Middle School. The school's mascot is the Bull, the women's teams are called the "Lady Bulls".In the Hereford Zone Prettyboy Reservoir covers an area of 206.5 sq/km behind the scenic Prettyboy Dam on the Gunpowder River.The Hereford High School varsity football team (The "Bulls") is well known throughout the state of Maryland. The Bulls have won 3 state titles in 1997, 2001 and 2002. Much of this success is attributed to coach Steve Turnbaugh who turned around a formerly downtrodden Hereford football program.Hereford High is also the host of the annual "Bull Run" Cross Country Invitational, run in the end of September, which is one of the largest East Coast cross country running events, attracting over 100 schools from surrounding states. The "grueling" course is noted for its hills, twists, turns and a steep ravine known as "The Dip", all making for what has been called "The Toughest Three Miles in Cross-Country" by John Dye of DyeStat.  Kent, Milton. "Bull Run Invitational showcase running out of elite competition", Baltimore Sun, September 28, 2007. Accessed December 27, 2007. "The Bull Run has become one of the biggest races on the East Coast cross country calendar each year, attracting schools from four surrounding states and the District of Columbia.... This year, more than 100 schools, 2,600 runners, spectators and well-wishers are expected to pack Hereford with cars lined along York Road for miles, as the course, which twists and turns along steep hills and woods, is as much a part of the event as the competition itself."   Hereford Theatre has won numerous statewide awards through CAPPIES, including Best Musical 2005 for their production of Pippin. They received the award at the Hippodrome Theatre in Baltimore, MD.The Hereford Ladies Faire and Chamber Choir are also known as one of the best award-winning choirs in the county, consistently receiving 1's in adjudications year after year.

Arcadia, Maryland   Arcadia is located in Baltimore County, Maryland.The population as of the 2000 census for zip code 21155, part of which is Arcadia, was 2349 (according to www.zipskinny.com). Elevation: 23 feet.Major League Baseball pitcher Otis Stocksdale was born in Arcadia on August 7, 1871. He played 6 years for Washington and 2 years for Boston.The town of Arcadia has many attractions and events. Three such events are (1) the Annual Arcadia Bluegrass Festival, (2) the Arcadia Championship Demolition Derbies, and (3) the annual show held by the Maryland Steam Historical Society, Inc. (www.MarylandSteam.org) which features steam engines, antique cars, tractor pulls, country music and a flea market, among other attractions. This show draws a crowd from all over the country.Arcadia, MD, became well known when it was chosen as the model for the fictional hometown, also called Arcadia, on the 2003 - 2005 CBS television series Joan of Arcadia.The fictional Arcadia was apparently a medium-sized town in an otherwise fairly rural area; it was large enough to have a city bus service but was adjacent to mountains and forests and apparently had only the one high school where Joan and her younger brother attended and her mother taught art.  Her father was the police chief until his investigation of the political corruption of the mayor and other officials found violations so serious that the city's municipal charter was revoked and it became an unincorporated area in its county, at which point Joan's father became a deputy sheriff.Despite its medium size and the apparently suburban nature of where Joan resides, several episodes have scenes in decidedly urban downtown or disadvantaged areas.  In fact, some of the series was filmed in and around Wilmington, Delaware, which has several "disadvantaged" sections.The real life Arcadia, Md is in fact a small rural town in upper Baltimore County Md. The post office is in fact labeled not Arcadia, but Upperco. Unlike the town Joan lived in, there is no police department, no Mayor or any other town governance.  There is one church (Lutheran), Arcadia Volunteer Fire Company (www.arcadiavfc.org), the carnival grounds and a railroad track runs through it. In recent decades there was a small independent convenience store and a Chrysler dealership neither of which exist today. It is adjacent to Md route 30 between the much larger towns of Reisterstown and Hampstead. There are three house lined roads that meander through it, Arcadia Avenue, Dover Rd and Trenton Rd.

Capital News Service (Maryland)   The Capital News Service (CNS) is a news wire affiliated with the University of Maryland, College Park. Facilitating student reporting Operated by the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, Capital News Service provides students with real-life reporting experiences—covering a beat, developing sources, generating story ideas and writing on deadline—all in close consultation with an instructor/editor.Capital News Service operates across all platforms: Print bureaus in Annapolis and Washington, D.C., provide a daily news feed to scores of clients, including daily and weekly newspapers, wire services, radio, television and online news outlets; the broadcast bureau produces a nightly newscast that goes to more than 400,000 households in suburban Washington; and an online newsmagazine, Maryland Newsline, does original news and feature reporting while showcasing work from the print and broadcast operations.The print bureaus transmit about 300 stories each semester for publication. Each student typically produces 25 to 30 stories that are usually picked up by several clients, giving students as many as 90 clips for the semester. CNS news, feature and investigative stories often appear on A1 of client papers, and have appeared in The Washington Post, The (Baltimore) Sun and The Washington Times. Select stories are sent to the McClatchy-Tribune News Service for distribution, and have appeared in The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, among other papers. The program has led directly to top internships and reporting jobs for most CNS alumni.Selected Merrill College of Journalism undergraduates and graduate students in the public affairs reporting sequence receive 12 credits in their bureau semester. The program is divided into three sections:  Bureau Students receive six credits for acting as full-time (35 to 40 hours a week) reporters from Tuesday through Friday, covering either Annapolis or Washington for Capital News Service.  Press Seminar Participants also are enrolled in an upper-level journalism seminar on Mondays with Knight Chair Haynes Johnson, one of the college's Pulitzer Prize winning faculty members. The class explores various topics in public affairs reporting, often with guest lecturers.

Savage River (Maryland)  The Savage River is a   U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed August 15, 2011  river in Garrett County, Maryland, and is the first major tributary of the North Branch Potomac River from its source. The river was named for 18th century surveyor John Savage.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains the Savage River Dam for flood control and recreation. It has trout fishing for brown trout, rainbow trout, brook trout and sometimes cutthroat trout.The last   of the river, from the Savage River Dam to its confluence with the Potomac at Bloomington, Maryland, is a destination for whitewater paddling and slalom racing, on the infrequent occasion when sufficient water is released from the dam.     There were three one-day recreational releases in 2011, two in June and one in September. The Savage has been used for the U.S. Olympic Trials and was the site of the 1989 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships on June 24-25.  The usual put-in for whitewater boats is   below the dam, where the highway crosses the river.   The slalom racing section begins   further downstream, below the   Piedmont Dam, and ends at the viewing stand above the pedestrian suspension bridge.   The 1989 race was the only time the Slalom World Championships have been held in the United States.  The next occasion will be a quarter century later in 2014, when they will be held on artificial whitewater at the nearby Adventure Sports Center International, constructed in 2007 as a more accessible alternative to the seldom-watered Savage. The average gradient for the Savage River's whitewater section is 75 feet/mile (1.4%), with sections at 100 feet/mile (1.9%), giving the rapids a whitewater class III to IV at the typical recreational release of  .  The rapids are fast and continuous, with very few eddies or calm spots.  References         
Maryland Route 10        Maryland Route 10 (MD 10) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as the Arundel Expressway, the highway runs   from MD 2 in Pasadena north to Interstate 695 (I-695) near Glen Burnie. MD 10 is a four- to six-lane freeway that serves as a bypass of MD 2 through Pasadena and Glen Burnie in northeastern Anne Arundel County. The highway is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length.  The Arundel Expressway was planned as a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway to provide relief to MD 2 between the cities as early as the 1950s. However, the portion of MD 10 south of Pasadena was removed from state plans when the I-97 corridor was chosen for the intercity freeway in the 1970s. MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 710 in the early 1970s and continued south to MD 648 in the late 1970s. The freeway was extended south to MD 100 and completed to MD 2 in the late 1980s and early 1990s, respectively. Route description MD 10 begins at an intersection with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena. The highway heads north as a four-lane freeway to a partial interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). There is no access from northbound MD 10 to eastbound MD 100 or from westbound MD 100 to southbound MD 10. MD 10 and MD 100 briefly run concurrently northwest as an eight-lane freeway and diverge at another partial interchange; in both carriageways, traffic must move over two lanes to remain on the same route. Just north of the MD 100 split, MD 10 has a half-diamond interchange with MD 177 (Mountain Road). That interchange has ramps from southbound MD 10 to MD 177 and from MD 177 to northbound MD 10. Traffic from eastbound MD 100 to northbound MD 10 and from southbound MD 10 to westbound MD 100 uses MD 177 and MD 2 as intermediaries.  MD 10 continues north from MD 177 through the east side of Glen Burnie as a six-lane freeway. The highway crosses over Marley Creek and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard). MD 10 parallels MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road) north then meets the latter highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highway crosses Furnace Branch and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 710 (Ordnance Road), where northbound MD 10 becomes two lanes wide. MD 10 reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The sweeping ramp from MD 10 to westbound I-695 merges into a collector-distributor lane that allows access from MD 10 to northbound MD 2 in Brooklyn Park.   HistoryThe Arundel Expressway was proposed as early as 1956 as a freeway connecting Baltimore and Annapolis to relieve congestion on MD 2.  By 1966, the highway was planned to begin at MD 173 at the city limits of Baltimore, intersect a planned cross-Patapsco section of the Baltimore Beltway, follow its current path to Pasadena, then continue paralleling MD 2 south to near U.S. Route 50 and US 301.  The portion of the Arundel Expressway inside the Beltway was removed from plans in 1967, with the Beltway instead serving to connect the expressway with highways into Baltimore.  The portion of the freeway south of Pasadena was planned to have intermediate interchanges at MD 648 in Severna Park and Jones Station Road (now College Parkway) in Arnold, and a toll plaza just south of the MD 100 interchange.  The portion of the Arundel Expressway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975.  Instead of a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway following the MD 2 corridor, in June 1979 the Maryland State Highway Administration announced it was constructing the freeway along the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors. The first section of modern MD 10 to open was the portion of freeway shared with MD 100, which opened in November 1970 from MD 2 to its eastern terminus.    Work began on the Arundel Expressway proper in 1970 when the interchange between the expressway and the Baltimore Beltway was started in 1970.  MD 710 was relocated over much of its length to make way for the construction of the freeways in 1972.  The Arundel Expressway opened from the Beltway to MD 710 in December 1972 and was marked as MD 10 by 1974.   Construction on the extension south to MD 648 was underway by 1975.  MD 10 opened south to MD 270 in October 1977 and to MD 648 in March 1978.   The freeway was proposed to continue south to MD 100, but that freeway extension was removed from short-term plans by 1981. Construction began in 1987 to extend MD 10, which was dubbed the "Road to Nowhere," from MD 648 to a more logical southern terminus.   The freeway opened from MD 648 to MD 100 in October 1988.   The final segment of MD 10, from MD 100 to MD 2, opened in March 1991.   The Arundel Expressway was planned to carry 75,000 as a complete Baltimore–Annapolis freeway.  However,  , only 49,000 vehicles used the highway daily just south of I-695.  MD 10 functions as a bypass of MD 2 north of Pasadena, but has not fulfilled its original purpose to relieve traffic congestion on MD 2 south to Annapolis. By the time of MD 10's completion in 1991, MD 2 was proposed to be expanded to six lanes south of MD 10.   , MD 2 has yet to be widened south of Pasadena.

Maryland Route 3      Maryland Route 3 (MD 3), also part of Robert Crain Highway, is the designation given to the former alignment of U.S. Route 301 from Bowie, Maryland, USA, to Baltimore.  It is named for Robert Crain of Baltimore. Route descriptionThe route is a direct continuation of the four-lane divided highway previously followed by US 301. North of MD 424, the median between the carriageways is up to   in width; several fast-food restaurants occupy the median in this area.  The route was upgraded to this format in its persona as US 301 in 1954.The route is severely congested; attempts to bypass it with new routings have failed.  One such routing would have been Interstate 297, a direct freeway link between Interstate 97 and US 50/US 301/I-595. HistoryIn the past, Crain Highway originally held the designation MD 3, then US 301, and it currently carries both of these designations on different sections.Started in 1922, Crain Highway was a new road built by the Maryland State Road Commission and ran from Baltimore to Southern Maryland.  It was completed in 1927.  With the opening of the Potomac River Bridge in 1940 it was joined with U.S. Route 301.  After the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built in 1952, US 301, which at that time ran along the current alignment of MD 3, was rerouted along US 50, across the Bay Bridge, and north to Wilmington, Delaware, as a bypass around the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.  Former US 301 north of US 50 was then given back the MD 3 designation.  After the construction of Interstate 97, MD 3 was cut back to I-97/MD 32, which led to the oddity of Maryland Route 3 Business in Glen Burnie being completely orphaned from its parent route.  Despite this, the route is still designated Business MD 3 as recently as 2011.Route 3 runs from the US 50/US 301 interchange (the western end of the US 50/301 concurrency) to an interchange with Interstate 97.  Business MD 3 begins   north of MD 3's northern terminus along Interstate 97 and runs through Glen Burnie.  Before the construction of the John Hanson Highway, the section where MD 450 currently overlaps with MD 3 would have been an overlapped section of US 50 and US 301.  US Routes 50 and 301 currently overlap for a much longer distance along parts of the John Hanson Highway and Blue Star Memorial Highway. The original route of MD 3, completed in 1927 on a greenfield alignment, was once designated Maryland Route 761. If MD 3 existed as a continuous route between its original southern end near Cobb Island (now signed as MD 254 and MD 257) and its original northern end at U.S. 1 in southwestern Baltimore, running via U.S. 301, Interstate 97, a short segment of the Baltimore Beltway and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, and Monroe Street in downtown Baltimore, it would be 74.69 miles long. MD 3 was routed via the Beltway and the Parkway to divert it away from city streets; originally it followed the Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard into Baltimore, meeting Monroe Street within today's interchange between the Parkway and Interstate 95.   Junction list                       Related routes Maryland Route 3 Business  Maryland Route 3 Business is a   thoroughfare through Glen Burnie, Maryland and is the northernmost part of the Robert Crain Highway. Maryland Business 3 starts at the Governor Ritchie Highway (Maryland Route 2) and continues south into Southgate and then ends officially at Interstate 97 where it becomes New Cut Road and the Business Route 3 designation is discontinued. Business Route 3 is the only Maryland state highway that no longer connects with its parent route. The reason behind that is because its parent route, Maryland Route 3, used to have the right of way where Interstate 97 currently is. Now MD 3 ends   south of Business Route 3's junction with Interstate 97. Robert Crain Highway is also the names of Maryland Route 3 between Millersville and Bowie and after Route 3 terminates at U.S. Route 301 in Bowie, southbound US 301 continues as that name until it reaches the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge that crosses the Potomac River into Dahlgren, Virginia.   Maryland Route 3 Truck  Maryland Route 3 Truck is an unsigned designation given to Pratt Street eastbound and Lombard Street westbound in downtown Baltimore, running from MD 295 (Paca Street/Greene Street) east to President Street.

Maryland Route 404   Maryland Route 404 is a major highway on Maryland's Eastern Shore in the United States. It runs   from Maryland Route 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 to Nassau (near Rehoboth Beach). The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 with the Delaware beaches. Along the way, MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. The road is a two-lane undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of the bypass around Denton, which is a four-lane divided highway.MD 404 was designated in 1940 to run from Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day Maryland Route 8, Maryland Route 18, and Maryland Route 662 to Wye Mills (where it follows its current routing to the Delaware border). By 1948, the route’s western terminus was moved to Maryland Route 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The MD 404 designation was planned for the Chesapeake Bay Bridge; however, US 50 was extended onto the Eastern Shore and MD 404’s western terminus was cut back to its current location in Wye Mills. A few realignments of the route have taken place since then, including a bypass of Queen Anne and Hillsboro, a segment east of Hillsboro by 1960, and the bypass of Denton built in the 1980s.Since MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware beaches, the road has a high accident rate. To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of the Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County is receiving $7.7 million for widening as a part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009. Route description Queen Anne's and Talbot CountiesMaryland Route 404 begins at an intersection with Maryland Route 662 (Old Wye Mills Road) in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, heading to the east on Queen Anne's Highway, a two-lane undivided road with a   speed limit.  It heads east through farmland along the Queen Anne's/Talbot County border, with the speed limit increasing to  , before reaching an intersection with U.S. Route 50 (Ocean Gateway).    Upon crossing US 50, MD 404 becomes a part of the main route between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware beaches.     MD 404 continues east through farmland with some residences and wooded areas as a   two-lane road, approaching the town of Queen Anne.  Further east, Old Queen Anne Road splits from MD 404, with MD 404 crossing entirely into Queen Anne's County.  It resumes east through some farmland before coming to an intersection with Maryland Route 309 (Starr Road).  Past MD 309, the route intersects the northern terminus of Maryland Route 303 (Main Street), which intersects the route as a northbound-only road that provides access to eastbound MD 404. From MD 303, the road heads into wooded areas adjacent to Tuckahoe State Park, crossing the abandoned Chesapeake Railroad right-of-way before crossing the Tuckahoe Creek.   Caroline CountyMaryland Route 404 enters Caroline County upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek, where it becomes Shore Highway.  It emerges from the woods into agricultural areas, intersecting Maryland Route 480 (Ridgely Road) near Hillsboro. Past that intersection, the route heads through a mix of woods and residences before intersecting Maryland Route 404 Alternate (Hillsboro Road), where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland.   Unsigned Maryland Route 485 (Saathoff Road) loops to the south of MD 404, returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of Maryland Route 312 (Downes Station Road).  The route continues to the southeast through farms, heading toward Denton. As the road approaches Denton, it widens into a four-lane divided highway that heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses.  Maryland Route 404 Business (Meeting House Road) splits from MD 404 to head through the center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north. The route continues east through fields before intersecting Maryland Route 328 (New Bridge Road).  Past this intersection, MD 404 crosses over the Choptank River. It continues east as a limited-access road with a diamond interchange with Maryland Route 313 (Greensboro Road) and unsigned Maryland Route 619 (Sixth Street), where some businesses are located.   MD 313 forms a concurrency with MD 404 and the two routes turn south, heading along the eastern side of Denton through woodland and then past residential neighborhoods. It turns to the southwest, heading into woods and intersecting Maryland Route 404 Business (Franklin Street/Gay Street) at an at-grade intersection. MD 313 and MD 404 continue as a surface road that turns south and heads through some commercial areas as a   road.  The speed limit increases back to   and the road heads south into farmland, passing by Martinak State Park. It crosses over Watts Creek and comes to an intersection with Maryland Route 16 (Harmony Road), with that route joining MD 313 and MD 404 for a three-way concurrency.   The three routes continue southeast, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road that heads through a mix of woods and farms with some homes.  The road turns more to the east-southeast, with MD 313 splitting from MD 16 and MD 404 by heading south on Federalsburg Highway in Andersontown. The road turns southeast and in a short distance, MD 16 splits from MD 404 by heading east on Greenwood Road.   Past this intersection, MD 404 continues southeast through farmland and woodland to the Delaware border, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404, which runs east to an intersection with Delaware Route 1 in Nassau (near Rehoboth Beach).  HistoryWhen Maryland started numbering state highways in 1927, the present-day routing of MD 404 was a state-maintained road between Queen Anne and Denton, even though the road had no assigned number then.  By 1940, MD 404 was designated, with the route’s western terminus in Matapeake, where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County. From Matapeake, the route ran along present day Maryland Route 8, Maryland Route 18, and Maryland Route 662 to Wye Mills, where it continued east along its current route.  By 1948, the route's western terminus was moved to Maryland Route 2 in Anne Arundel County, crossing the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry, roughly where the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is now.       The Chesapeake Bay Bridge was originally to be designated as part of MD 404. However, it was decided for US 50 to be extended onto the Eastern Shore, replacing MD 404 between Annapolis and Wye Mills.    By 1960, a bypass was built for MD 404 around Queen Anne and Hillsboro with the former alignment becoming Maryland Route 404 Alternate and a portion of the route between Hillsboro and Denton was also bypassed. This former alignment of MD 404 is now known as Saathoff Road and has the unsigned Maryland Route 485 designation.    In the early 1980s, a four-lane divided bypass of Denton was constructed for the route and the alignment of MD 404 through Denton became Maryland Route 404 Business.  The divided portion highway of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route.  This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001.  FutureThe Maryland State Highway Administration is working on improvements to Maryland Route 404 in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway.    The primary motive behind the widening is the high accident rate that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic.  As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million is going to widening a portion of MD 404 east of the Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs.  Junction list                                      Related routes Hillsboro alternate route  Maryland Route 404 Alternate is a   long alternate route of Maryland Route 404 in Talbot and Caroline counties. The route runs along the former alignment of Maryland Route 404 through the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro.  The route begins at an intersection with MD 309 (Cordova Road) near Queen Anne, Talbot County, where it heads east on two-lane undivided Millsboro Denton Road. West of MD 309, Old Queen Anne Road continues west to MD 404. MD 404 Alternate passes through woodland, crossing under the abandoned Chesapeake Railroad before coming to MD 303 (Lewistown Road). At this point, the route turns north to form a concurrency with MD 303 along Talbot Avenue, and the two routes enter Queen Anne as it turns to the east. MD 303 splits from MD 404 Alternate by turning north on Main Street,  while MD 404 Alternate continues east past homes, intersecting Maryland Route 518 (First Street).      As the road runs a short distance to the south of the Tuckahoe Creek, there is an industrial building on the south side of the road.  Upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek, MD 404 Alternate enters Hillsboro in Caroline County and becomes Hillsboro Road.  The route continues through residential areas of the town. Upon leaving Hillsboro, the road heads into agricultural areas with a few homes and a patch of woods.  MD 404 Alternate ends at an intersection with MD 404 east of Hillsboro.  Denton business loop  Maryland Route 404 Business is a   long business route of Maryland Route 404 through the town of Denton in Caroline County. The route runs along the former alignment of Maryland Route 404 that was bypassed by the divided, four-lane Denton Bypass.  MD 404 Business branches off from MD 404 west of Denton by heading southeast on a two-lane divided road called Meeting House Road that soon becomes undivided as it passes through farmland with some businesses. As it comes to MD 328 (New Bridge Road) in West Denton, the route passes near residences.      The road crosses the Choptank River into Denton, where it becomes Franklin Street. Shortly after the river, MD 404 Business splits into a one-way pair that follows Franklin Street eastbound and Gay Street westbound.  The one-way pair, which has two lanes in each direction, carries the route through the residential and commercial downtown of Denton, where it intersects Maryland Route 619 (Sixth Street). In the eastern part of Denton, the two directions of MD 404 Business turn south and join again, becoming a four-lane divided highway with the Franklin Street name that runs through woodland.    MD 404 Business ends at MD 313 and MD 404 a short distance later.  Auxiliary routes  MD 404C runs along Liden School Road from MD 404 northeast to MD 404D southeast of Denton in Caroline County.

Oella, Maryland   Oella is a small, historic mill town on the Patapsco River in western Baltimore County, Maryland, located between Catonsville and Ellicott City. It is a 19th century village of millworkers' homes. History Oella was founded in 1808 by the Union Manufacturing Company as a working class community for the company's mill workers.  It was one of the earliest and most extensive cotton factories in the United States and used water-powered looms as early as 1819.  The Oella Historic District includes the village that consists of 19th century workers housing and one late 19th century church. The only known 20th century building is the W.J. Dickey Company Mill constructed in 1919.  A drawing from 1812 by Maximilian Godefroy shows most of the stone buildings. The brick houses date from the mid-19th century, while the frame buildings were constructed at the end of the century.  The Oella Methodist Church is a simple frame building with a tower on the northeast corner, which has been converted for offices. The Patapsco River continued to provide power to generate electricity until 1972 when hurricane Agnes flooded the power plant. The same year the Dickey Company ceased manufacturing. Maryland Historical Trust: Listing for Oella Historic District It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.   Also listed on the National Register at Oella are the Ellicott's Mills Historic District and Mt. Gilboa Chapel. Oella is along the route of the Trolley Line Number 9 Trail Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum  A park commemorating Benjamin Banneker  is located in a stream valley woodland at the former site of Banneker's farm and residence at the eastern edge of the Oella community.  The Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks manages the park, which was dedicated on June 9, 1998.  The park, which  encompasses   and contains archaeological sites and extensive nature trails, is the largest original African American historical site in the United States. (1)   (2)    (3)   (4)   (5)    The primary focus of the park is a museum highlighting Banneker's contributions. The museum contains a visitors center that features a collection of Banneker's works and artifacts, a community gallery, a gift shop and a patio garden.    On November 12, 2009, officials opened a   replica of Banneker's log cabin on the park grounds, reportedly two days before the 278th anniversary of Banneker's birth.  Baltimore County's delegation to the Maryland General Assembly secured a $400,000 state bond for the design and construction of the cabin.  The original estimated cost to construct the cabin in accordance with its drawings and specifications was $240,700. A historical marker that the Maryland Historical Society erected to commemorate Banneker stands on the grounds of the park.  The marker replaced the last of three earlier markers that vandals had previously destroyed.  Persons of note  Benjamin Banneker (November 9, 1731 – October 9, 1806) was a free African American scientist, surveyor, almanac author and farmer. Born in Baltimore County to a free African American woman and a former slave, Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by Major Andrew Ellicott that surveyed the borders of the original District of Columbia, the federal capital district of the United States. (1)   (2)   (3)       Banneker's knowledge of astronomy helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with Thomas Jefferson, drafter of the United States Declaration of Independence, on the topics of slavery and racial equality.  Abolitionists and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised his works.

Maryland Route 5   Maryland Route 5 is a   long state highway that runs north–south in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs from  Point Lookout in St. Mary's County north to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland, Prince George's County. MD 5 begins as the two-lane undivided Point Lookout Road which runs from Point Lookout, St. Mary's County, to an intersection with Maryland Route 235 in the northern part of the county.  Point Lookout Road passes  through rural areas as well as the county seat of Leonardtown. After the MD 235 intersection, the route becomes the four-lane divided Three Notch Road and continues into Charles County, where it becomes Leonardtown Road. Here, the route bypasses Hughesville and continues north toward the Waldorf area, which it bypasses to the east on Mattawoman Beantown Road. The route merges onto U.S. Route 301 (Crain Highway) and enters Prince George's County, splitting from US 301 at an interchange in Brandywine. From here, MD 5 continues north on Branch Avenue, running through suburban areas, before becoming a freeway as it passes Andrews Air Force Base and interchanges with the Capital Beltway. Past the Capital Beltway, the route runs through suburban areas of Hillcrest Heights and Suitland before reaching the D.C. border, where Branch Avenue continues toward Pennsylvania Avenue.MD 5 was designated by 1927 to run from Point Lookout to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland. By 1940, the route was directed to run to the D.C. border along Naylor Road. The routing was moved to Branch Avenue by 1960, when the route was also widened into a divided highway between the proposed Capital Beltway and just south of the Suitland Parkway. By 1975, the route to a divided highway between the northern intersection with MD 235 and the Capital Beltway with the exception of the portion through Hughesville. The route bypassed the center of Leonardtown by 1996 and by 1999, MD 5 was moved to Mattawoman Beantown Road to the east of Waldorf, replacing Maryland Route 205. In both cases, the former routings of MD 5 became Maryland Route 5 Business. In Prince George's County, several interchanges were built along MD 5 between MD 223 and the Capital Beltway. In 2007, a four-lane, divided bypass of Hughesville was completed, alleviating the traffic bottleneck within that town at the intersection of Maryland Route 231. The portion of MD 5 between US 301 and the Capital Beltway is slated to be upgraded to a full freeway, with an interchange at Maryland Route 373 (Accokeek Road)/Brandywine Road planned to be completed in 2011 and the remainder still in the planning stages.

The route reaches Hughesville, where MD 5 bypasses the community to the east on a limited-access highway and Maryland Route 5 Business (MD 625) continues to the north through Hughesville on Old Leonardtown Road.   The bypass heads through wooded areas before coming to a dumbbell interchange with Maryland Route 231 (Prince Frederick Road) that features roundabouts where the ramps meet MD 231.  Past MD 231, the bypass continues through woodland before intersecting MD 5 Business again.   From here, MD 5 heads northwest through a mix of woods and farms with some residences and businesses.  The route turns to the west and passes through Bryantown, where it intersects Olivers Shop Road/Bryantown Road intersection.   The road turns to the northwest past Bryantown and heads through wooded areas, passing through Zekiah Swamp.   MD 5 comes to an intersection with Maryland Route 488 (La Plata Road) and turns north again, heading through a mix of woods, farms, and residences. The speed limit decreases to   as the route heads through wooded residential neighborhoods before increasing to   again as MD 5 heads back into farmland. The route reaches the eastern edge of the planned community of St. Charles, where it comes to an intersection where St. Charles Parkway heads south into St. Charles, MD 5 Business heads to the west on Leonardtown Road, and MD 5 turns north onto Mattawoman Beantown Road.  MD 5 follows Mattawoman Beantown Road, a four-lane divided highway with a speed limit of   that bypasses the center of Waldorf to the east. The route intersects Poplar Hill Road, which leads to the house of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd.   Mattawoman Beantown Road carries MD 5 north through farm fields before heading into woodland. It continues into suburban residential areas of Waldorf, passing by the entrance to the Pinefield neighborhood, which used to be intertwined with several Nike Missile installations.  The route crosses over CSX’s Popes Creek Subdivision before coming to an intersection with U.S. Route 301 (Crain Highway). Here, MD 5 forms a concurrency with US 301 and continues north as a six-lane divided highway.   Prince George's CountyThe Crain Highway crosses the Mattawoman Creek into Prince George's County, where it heads north as a   road through wooded areas with some businesses along the road. US 301 splits from MD 5 at an interchange near Brandywine with MD 5 continuing to the north on four-lane divided Branch Avenue.   A short distance past US 301, the route intersects Maryland Route 373 (Accokeek Road).    It continues north through woodland with some businesses and adjacent residential areas before passing by the Southern Maryland Hospital Center at the Surratts Road intersection.  Past Surratts Road, the route heads through suburban residential areas of Clinton as a six-lane road before turning into a freeway that comes to a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) with Maryland Route 223 (Woodyard Road). The route heads northwest through commercial areas, with interchanges located at Malcolm Road (MD 5M)/Schultz Road and Coventry Way (MD 5L), the latter being a single-point urban interchange.   The route has a southbound exit to Old Branch Avenue and a northbound entrance from Old Alexandria Ferry Road before it turns north and heads through wooded surroundings, forming the western boundary of Andrews Air Force Base.  MD 5 comes to another SPUI with Maryland Route 337 (Allentown Road) in Camp Springs. A short distance later, the road interchanges with Manchester Drive (MD 5R)/Linda Lane (MD 5Q) before heading north as a   freeway to an interchange with Interstate 95/Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway).  Past the Capital Beltway, MD 5 becomes a surface road again, intersecting Maryland Route 535 (Auth Road), which provides access to northbound MD 5 from southbound I-95/I-495 as well as to the Branch Avenue station on Washington Metro’s Green Line. The route continues northwest into commercial areas, intersecting Maryland Route 967C (Simpson Road)/Auth Way and Maryland Route 967A (Old Branch Avenue). The route narrows to four lanes and turns west, coming to an interchange with Maryland Route 414 (St. Barnabas Road) in Marlow Heights. MD 5 turns to the northwest past this interchange as a   road, passing by the Marlow Heights Shopping Center and continuing to Hillcrest Heights, where the route intersects Maryland Route 458 (Silver Hill Road) adjacent to the Iverson Mall.   The route passes more businesses and heads toward Suitland, where it intersects MD 414 (Bonita Street) again. The speed limit drops to   and the road continues to an intersection with Maryland Route 637 (Naylor Road). North of Naylor Road, the route passes under the Green Line of the Washington Metro, interchanges with the Suitland Parkway, and narrows to a 2-lane undivided road in quick succession.   MD 5 passes through wooded areas before coming to an intersection with Southern Avenue at the Washington, D.C. border where the route ends and Branch Avenue continues into the District of Columbia toward Pennsylvania Avenue.  HistoryMD 5 was designated by 1927 to run from north of Point Lookout State Park to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland.  By 1940, the route was extended south into Point Lookout State Park and it was routed to the District of Columbia border on Naylor Road while MD 637 followed Branch Avenue to the D.C. border. District of Columbia Route 5 continued into Washington, D.C. on Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, and 11th Street to District of Columbia Route 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue).    MD 5 was directed to follow Branch Avenue to the D.C. border and DC 5 was modified to follow Branch Avenue from the Maryland border to DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue), which it followed west to the White House, by 1946.     By 1960, DC 5 no longer existed while MD 5 was widened into a divided highway from the proposed Capital Beltway to just south of the Suitland Parkway.    Further widening of the route to a divided highway occurred by 1975 between US 301 and the Capital Beltway, along the US 301 concurrency, and along Leonardtown Road between MD 235 and US 301 with the exception of the portion through Hughesville.    MD 5 was routed to bypass Leonardtown by 1996, with the former route becoming MD 5 Business.    Another rerouting of MD 5 in Waldorf by 1999 moved the route from Leonardtown Road and US 301 to Mattawoman Beantown Road, where it replaced Maryland Route 205.     With this modification, Leonardtown Road between Mattawoman Beantown Road and US 301 became MD 5 Business.  Also by 1999, three interchanges were constructed in Prince George's County at MD 223, Coventry Lane, and MD 337.  In 2001, an interchange was constructed with Manchester Drive and Linda Lane in Camp Springs.   In February 2007, a $56 million limited-access bypass around Hughesville was completed, redirecting MD 5 to the east of the community. The bypass was built due to the heavy amount of congestion at the old intersection of MD 5 and MD 231 in Hughesville's central business district.    Groundbreaking for construction of the bypass took place on November 5, 2004, with $10 million in federal funds given to the project.  The old portion of MD 5 that went through Hughesville received the official MD 625 designation in 2006, even though it is signed as MD 5 Business.     The bypass was formally opened on August 8, 2007.  FutureThere are plans to improve MD 5 in Prince George's County due to traffic congestion along the route. An interchange is planned to be built with MD 373 and Brandywine Road in Brandywine that would widen the route to six lanes in the vicinity of the proposed interchange.    A notice to begin construction of Phase 1, which will widen MD 5 to 6 lanes in the vicinity of the future interchange was issued in November 2009 with completion in Spring 2011. Phase 2, which will build the interchange itself, is in design with a Preliminary Investigation Meeting planned for Summer 2010.    In addition, the route is planned to be upgraded to a full freeway between US 301 and the Capital Beltway, with new interchanges at Burch Hill Road/Earnshaw Drive and Surratts Road. This project is currently in the planning stages with many alternatives including upgrading only portions to freeway, adding reversible lanes or high-occupancy vehicle lanes, and various interchange designs.

Glen Echo Park, Maryland   Glen Echo Park in Glen Echo, Maryland, formerly known as Glen Echo Amusement Park, is an arts and cultural center in Montgomery County, Maryland.  It is managed by the Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture in cooperation with the National Park Service as part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway.  It began in 1891 as a National Chautauqua Assembly and operated as an amusement park until 1968.  Today, the Park offers hundreds of classes and workshops in the visual and performing arts and is home to fourteen resident artists and arts organizations.  The Park is well known for its antique Dentzel carousel, its Spanish Ballroom, its many public festivals, including Family Day and the Washington Folk Festival, its children's theaters, and its social dance program. The National Park Service offers park history tours and other programs and maintains a visitors area. Glen Echo Park Today  A Community-based Arts and Cultural CenterGlen Echo Park, located at 7300 MacArthur Blvd. in Glen Echo, Maryland, six miles northwest of Georgetown along the scenic Potomac River palisades, is unique among National Parks. Originally a Chautauqua retreat, then an amusement park, it is now a arts and cultural center managed by the Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture. It is home to a community of artists, educators, dancers, and performers who share their knowledge and expertise with more than 425,000 visitors each year. With financial as well as volunteer support from the Park’s patrons and area residents, the Glen Echo Park Partnership and the National Park Service ensure that this remarkable community continues to thrive. Social Dance ProgramAs noted above, the Park is known for its social dance program. Glen Echo Park offers regular social dance events and classes in waltz, swing, contra, salsa, and more. Dances take place in the historic Spanish Ballroom, the Bumper Car Pavilion, and the recently-renovated, climate-controlled Ballroom Annex. The renovation of the Spanish Ballroom in 2003 brought it back to its original splendor, and it remains the premiere site for dancing in the Washington DC area. All social dances are open to the public, for all ages, with no prior experience or partner required. All dances offer an introductory lesson before the dance begins and most include live music. More than 63,000 dancers attend dances at Glen Echo Park each year.The park is near several notable sites such as the Clara Barton House and the C&O canal. History  ChautauquaEdwin and Edward Baltzley, inventors, industrialists, and real estate developers, hoped to build upon the banks of the Potomac River a suburban community free of the urban pollution of late-nineteenth century Washington, DC. In order to compete with other suburban developments, the Baltzley brothers planned a series of opulent attractions for their would-be community.  On February 24, 1891, the Baltzley brothers incorporated the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo, the 53rd such assembly, and immediately set to building a stone citadel of culture to complement their real estate and resort enterprises.  Starting in June 1891, their arts and culture program included lectures and concerts in a six thousand person amphitheater, special classes in Bible studies, Greek and Hebrew, physical training regiments, and university extension courses. Hundreds flocked to the site to picnic, attend lectures on American history by Jane Meade Welch, courses on ancient Egypt by Lysander Dickerman, and concerts by John Philip Sousa.  Clara Barton, encouraged by the Baltzley’s, not only located her home and American Red Cross headquarters at Glen Echo, but she presided over the Women’s Executive Committee for the Chautauqua itself.  The inaugural season’s success warranted an extension well into August.  Reasons for the Chautauqua’s Failure By the spring of 1892 the various Baltzley enterprises were gravely in debt. On April 7, 1892, the Glen Echo Sand and Building Company, a Baltzley subsidiary, borrowed a large sum of money giving the Chautauqua site as collateral. This was one of many Baltzley mortgages on the site. The financial difficulties spread to the Glen Echo Railroad Company, yet another Baltzley enterprise, which, because of the Army Corps of Engineers and the city aqueduct system, had failed to bring the much anticipated street car service to the Chautauqua site and Glen Echo Village. Compounding their overextended credit, the Baltzley brothers found themselves the victim of common rumor. At the beginning of the 1892 season, rumor had spread throughout the District of Columbia that Glen Echo was rampant with malaria.  Regardless of the validity of these accusations, when combined with the brother’s precarious finances, the Chautauqua site fell into disuse.  Amusement parkIn the early 20th century it was turned into an amusement park, which operated until the late 1960s.  Like many public facilities in and around the Washington area, Glen Echo was restricted to whites for 63 out of the first 70 years of its history. However, on June 30, 1960 a group of college students (primarily from Howard University) Glen Echo Park - Frequently Asked Questions (U.S. National Park Service)   staged a sit-in protest on the carousel and five African American students were subsequently arrested. (The arrests were later appealed to the Supreme Court and the convictions reversed in Griffin v. Maryland.) As a result, an eleven-week civil rights campaign began; students and residents of Bannockburn alike came out in force. The park opened the doors to all races in the 1961 season.   Like most small suburban amusement parks, attendance at Glen Echo shrunk in the late 1960s, and the park closed in 1968. Today, the park is served by a bus coming from the Bethesda Metro station. National Park Service Since 1971, the Park has been part of the National Park Service.  Various renovations, backed by government funds and individual donations, have taken place throughout the park, most notably the Spanish Ballroom, the Arcade building that now hosts art classes, and the art deco style neon sign.  The park's carousel and large children's theaters remain an attraction for all ages in Bethesda and Glen Echo. Every weekend (Thursday through Sunday) the park hosts social dances in the Spanish Ballroom, the open-air Bumper Car Pavilion, and the Ballroom Annex. The venues host many styles of dances, including swing, contra, salsa, waltz, tango, and blues.The last operating park ride, and one of the highlights of the park today, is a 1921 Dentzel menagerie carousel with 38 horses, 2 chariots, 4 rabbits, 4 ostriches, a lion, a tiger, a giraffe, and a prancing deer.  The carousel operates from May through September, running from 12 to 6 on weekends and 10-2 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays all season and Fridays in July and August.  In its heyday the carousel sported an operating brass ring game, in which daring riders could reach out and pull a ring out of a holder next to the carousel.  Grabbing a brass ring would win the lucky rider a free ride.  The brass ring arm is still visible today, although it no longer operates.The face of the carousel had changed greatly since 1921, with the animals, rounding boards, inner drum panels, and band organ receiving several new coats of park paint over the years.  An installation photograph from 1921, as compared to the carousel in 1983, showed an original design of the body and tack on the Indian horse that was very different from the present-day animal.  Chipping away at the horse's paint revealed several strata of differently colored and styled paint jobs spanning the past sixty years, with the original 1921 paint at the bottom.  The carousel was restored by specialist Rosa Ragan, who has restored several other carousels in the US. She restored the Indian horse by removing the park paint, exposing as much of the original paint as possible, and filling in the gaps in the original paint, a process called inpainting, before covering the horse in a protective varnish.  This process, however, exposed the original paint to damage from riders, thus rendering the horse unridable.  In order to restore each animal without risking damage to the original paint, Ragan developed a new process of uncovering the original paint job, recording the colors and design, and then covering the original paint with a reversible varnish before giving the animal a white base coat and repainting it in the original colors.  However, Ragan did leave a small window of original paint exposed on each animal for riders to find.  These glimpses of the original 1921 paint are called "windows to the past" and can be found on the plain side (the inward-facing side) of each animal.  Ragan's 20-year restoration of the carousel completely overhauled the animals, the band organ, and the rounding boards and drum panels, returning the carousel to its original beauty and splendor.The carousel was in a scene in the 1989 comedy Chances Are starring Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd.

Maryland Route 185  Maryland Route 185 (MD 185) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as Connecticut Avenue, the state highway runs   from Chevy Chase Circle at the Washington, D.C. border north to MD 97 in Aspen Hill.  MD 185 serves as a major north-south commuter route in southern Montgomery County, connecting the District of Columbia with the residential suburbs of Chevy Chase, Kensington, and Wheaton.MD 185's history can be divided into two segments.  The portion south of Kensington was included in the state highway system by 1927 as an extension of Connecticut Avenue out of the District of Columbia and was the westernmost stretch of MD 193.  The Chevy Chase to Kensington stretch was expanded to a divided highway in the 1950s.  The segment of MD 185 between Kensington and Aspen Hill was built as a divided highway on a new alignment in the 1960s and designated MD 185.  The MD 185 designation was extended south of Kensington, replacing MD 193, in the 1970s.  Construction projects in the 1980s and early 1990s completed MD 185 as a six-lane highway. Route descriptionMD 185 begins at Chevy Chase Circle on the border of Washington, D.C.  Connecticut Avenue continues south into the Chevy Chase neighborhood of the District of Columbia on the south side of the circle, while Western Avenue intersects the east and west sides of the circle.     MD 185 heads north as a six-lane divided highway with a speed limit of   through an affluent residential area in Chevy Chase Village.   After passing Chevy Chase Country Club to the west, the state highway intersects MD 191 (Bradley Lane) and leaves Chevy Chase Village.   MD 185 continues due north, passing the headquarters of 4-H and intersecting MD 410 (East–West Highway).   After crossing MD 410, the speed limit increases to   and the state highway passes Columbia Country Club.    MD 185 enters a commercial area where it crosses the Capital Crescent Trail at-grade and intersects Manor Road.  Manor Road fills the missing movements at the following five-way intersection with Jones Bridge Road and Kensington Parkway, where left turns are prohibited from both directions of MD 185 and westbound Jones Bridge Road. After crossing Jones Bridge Road, MD 185 continues north through residential areas and intersects the Capital Beltway at a partial cloverleaf interchange.   Immediately after the interchange, the state highway crosses Rock Creek and intersects Beach Drive within Rock Creek Park.   MD 185 leaves the valley of Rock Creek and enters the town of Chevy Chase View.   Upon entering Kensington and the Kensington Historic District, the state highway veers to the northwest and back to the north ahead of the intersection with MD 547 (Knowles Avenue), where the highway enters a commercial area.   After crossing CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision and MARC's Brunswick Line, MD 185 crosses MD 192 (Plyers Mill Road).   As the road turns northeast, the state highway meets MD 193 (University Boulevard).  While MD 193 continues northeast toward Wheaton, MD 185 veers left to continue due north.  The next intersection, Perry Avenue, is used to complete the movements between MD 185 north and MD 193 east. After leaving the town limits of Kensington, MD 185 becomes a six-lane controlled access divided highway with a speed limit of   passing between residential subdivisions.   After crossing a tributary of Rock Creek, the state highway intersects MD 586 at an acute intersection.   MD 185 then becomes lined with service roads ahead of and after the intersection with Randolph Road.   The speed limit increases to   after Randolph Road.   Beyond Weller Road, the state highway crosses Turkey Branch and then a bridge over Matthew Henson State Park.   MD 185 then enters Aspen Hill and intersects Aspen Hill Road within a commercial area.   The state highway meets its northern terminus at MD 97 (Georgia Avenue).  Connecticut Avenue continues as a county-maintained highway north through Bel Pre Road into Rossmoor, home of the Leisure World retirement community.  HistoryMD 185 was constructed and designated on two different segments of the current state highway at different times.  The first section to be built was between Chevy Chase and Kensington as an extension of Connecticut Avenue into Montgomery County, which was designated MD 193.     The section between Bradley Lane and Kensington was paved by 1927.     The segment south of Bradley Lane was paved as a county road by 1930.     By 1936, the segment of Connecticut Avenue south of Bradley Lane had come under state control.     The grade crossing of the railroad tracks in Kensington was eliminated by the construction of a bypass and bridge in 1936 as well.     The section of MD 193 south of MD 410 was marked as an alternate route of US 240 by 1946, a designation it retained until the 1960s.        The segment from the D.C. line to north of MD 410 in Chevy Chase was expanded to a multi-lane divided highway in 1950.     The remainder of the route to Kensington was expanded to a divided highway between 1957 and 1960.    The section of highway between Kensington and Aspen Hill was built on a new alignment as a four-lane divided highway in stages in the 1960s and given the designation of MD 185.  The highway was completed from Kensington to MD 586 in 1963.   The remaining section north to Aspen Hill was completed in 1969.    Immediately north of the crossing of Turkey Branch is a bridge that was to be MD 185's overpass of the Washington Outer Beltway.  Ramp stubs exist next to the bridge for the partial cloverleaf interchange with this cancelled freeway.  By 1980, the MD 185 designation was extended south from Kensington south to the D.C. line.     The state highway was expanded to six lanes to Beach Drive in 1986 and through Kensington in 1991.

Delaware and Maryland Railroad 
Maryland Route 70      Maryland Route 70 (MD 70) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as Roscoe Rowe Boulevard, the highway runs   from MD 450 in Annapolis north to Bestgate Road in Parole. MD 70 is the primary highway connecting U.S. Route 50 and US 301 with downtown Annapolis. The highway also serves several sets of Maryland state government offices and Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. MD 70 was constructed in the mid-1950s contemporaneously with the US 50 freeway. The highway was extended north to Bestgate Road in the early 1990s. Route description MD 70 begins at an intersection with MD 450 (College Avenue) in downtown Annapolis. This intersection is next to Government House, the residence of the Governor of Maryland, and one block north of the Maryland State House. MD 70 heads northwest for two blocks as Bladen Street, a four-lane divided boulevard that passes between state office buildings, including the offices of members of the Maryland General Assembly. At Calvert Street, the highway's name changes to Roscoe Rowe Boulevard. A two-lane ramp splits from southbound MD 70 just south of the southern end of the highway's bridge over College Creek, the point at which maintenance responsibility changes from the city of Annapolis to the state. The highway passes between several sets of government offices, including the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Maryland State Archives, leading up to its intersection with MD 435 (Taylor Avenue). MD 70 passes to the east of Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium before crossing Weems Creek and leaving the city of Annapolis. The highway meets US 50 and US 301 (John Hanson Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Beyond the interchange, MD 70 curves to the west and intersects Bestgate Road and Tidewater Colony Drive; the latter street leads to the historic home Howard's Inheritance. The highway continues along Bestgate Road and becomes a four-lane road with a center turn lane before reaching its northern terminus at an arbitrary point west of Compton Drive and Willie Drive. Bestgate Road continues west as a county highway toward the Annapolis Mall in the center of Parole.   HistoryMD 70 from College Avenue to US 50 and US 301 is named for Roscoe C. Rowe, the mayor of Annapolis from 1949 until his 1952 death. Rowe was credited with organizing the city of Annapolis's financial contribution to construct the boulevard and for persuading the Maryland State Roads Commission to finance the construction of the bridge across College Creek. Construction of MD 70 began from US 50, then also under construction, to Weems Creek, including the bridge over the creek, in October 1952.  Construction on the highway resumed in May 1954; the section from Weems Creek to College Avenue was completed in November 1954, five months after the US 50 freeway opened from MD 450 to MD 2 east of the Severn River.   The boulevard's interchange with US 50 was originally a trumpet interchange.  MD 70's southern end was originally a one-way pair; traffic leaving Annapolis followed Bladen Street from College Avenue toward College Creek and traffic entering Annapolis veered south onto Northwest Street to end at Church Circle.   Bladen Street was expanded to a two-way boulevard in 1983.  MD 70 was extended north to its present terminus and its junction with US 50 and US 301 was changed to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 1991.   The state highway's bridges over Weems Creek and College Creek were replaced between 2004 and 2006.  Junction list            Auxiliary routesMD 70 has two existing auxiliary routes and one former route. All three routes were established in 2002 along county highways relocated as part of the extension of MD 70 north to Bestgate Road.   MD 70A is the designation for the   stretch of North Lawrence Road north from MD 70.   MD 70B was the designation for the   portion of Tidewater Colony Drive south from the intersection between Roscoe Rowe Boulevard and Bestgate Road.   MD 70B was transferred to county maintenance in 2009.  MD 70C is the designation for the   segment of Bestgate Road east from the intersection of MD 70 and Tidewater Colony Drive.

Maryland Route 528    Maryland Route 528 (MD 528) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as Coastal Highway, the state highway runs   from the southern terminus of its companion route, unsigned Maryland Route 378, in downtown Ocean City north to the Delaware state line at the northern edge of the resort town, where the highway continues as Delaware Route 1 (DE 1). MD 528 and MD 378 are the primary north–south streets of Ocean City, where they provide access to countless hotels, condos, restaurants, shops, and other businesses catering to tourists. Due to their heavy seasonal traffic and access to hurricane evacuation routes, which include U.S. Route 50 (US 50), MD 90, and DE 54, MD 528 and MD 378 are part of the National Highway System between US 50 in downtown Ocean City and the Delaware state line.   Both Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in the late 19th century. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue in 1927 and MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue in 1933. MD 528 was extended north of 15th Street to the Delaware state line in 1939. Both highways were rebuilt and widened in the 1950s. MD 528 was expanded to a six-lane divided highway north of the one-way pair in the late 1980s. Route descriptionMD 528 and MD 378 both have their southern termini at the intersection of Baltimore Avenue and South 1st Street at the southern end of Ocean City. Baltimore Avenue continues south and then turns east toward a large municipal parking lot serving attractions on the Ocean City Boardwalk, including Trimper's Rides. From the southern terminus, MD 528 heads west on South 1st Street and then north as Philadelphia Avenue, while MD 378 heads north as Baltimore Avenue. The two state highways form a one-way pair, with MD 378 carrying three lanes of northbound traffic and MD 528 carrying three lanes of southbound traffic.  Both streets intersect South Division Street, which was the site of the railroad terminus in Ocean City and is currently the site of Sunset Park, and Worcester Street, which was the site of the first automobile bridge to the resort in 1916.    MD 528 and MD 378 head north through the downtown area of Ocean City, where they meet the eastern terminus of US 50 at North Division Street. North Division Street between MD 528 and MD 378 is one-way eastbound, so traffic coming from the south uses North 1st Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378A, to access US 50 west. MD 528 and MD 378 continue north to 9th Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378B. MD 528 becomes two-way at 9th Street. MD 378 continues north as a two-lane street northbound to 15th Street, where the state highway turns west to reach its northern terminus at MD 528. Baltimore Avenue continues north of 15th Street as a two-way municipal street to its northern end at 33rd Street.  MD 528 continues north from 9th Street as a divided highway with two lanes northbound and three lanes southbound.  The state highway gains a third lane northbound at MD 378 (15th Street). At 17th Street, MD 528 assumes its form for the remainder of its course to the Delaware state line: three lanes in each direction plus a continuous combined right turn and bus lane in both directions. After passing the Jolly Roger Amusement Park, MD 528 meets 33rd Street, which is one-way westbound coming from the northern end of Baltimore Avenue. North of 33rd Street, MD 528 becomes Coastal Highway, the only through highway on the barrier island. The state highway passes the Ocean City Convention Center at 40th Street and intersects the eastern terminus of MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) at 62nd Street. MD 528 continues north until it reaches the Delaware state line at 146th Street, two blocks east of the Fenwick Island Light. Coastal Highway continues into Fenwick Island as DE 1, which meets the eastern terminus of DE 54 one block north of the state line.   HistoryBaltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street.  The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street.  Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s.  MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927.   MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933.  MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.  In the 1940s, traffic in Ocean City increased so much there was a movement to make Baltimore and Philadelphia Avenues one-way in the downtown area, a change that was implemented by 1948.   Traffic volume in Ocean City increased even more following the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952, leading to expansion of the city's north–south arterials. MD 378 was widened along its entire length in 1951 and 1952.  MD 528 was widened to four lanes along its entire length in 1953 and 1954.  Both state highways were extended to their present southern termini at that time.  The first portion of MD 528 to be expanded to a divided highway was around the intersection with MD 90; the highway between 60th and 63rd Streets was reconstructed by 1978.  Two sections of six-lane divided highway were completed around 1989: from 25th Street to 65th Street, and from 85th Street to 122nd Street.  By 1991, MD 528 was divided highway from 25th Street to the Delaware state line.   The segment of Philadelphia Avenue from 9th Street to 25th Street was changed from a five- to six-lane highway with a center turn lane to a divided highway in 2001.  Junction list                      Related routes Maryland Route 378 is a   unsigned highway in Ocean City that follows portions of Baltimore Avenue and 15th Street from the southern terminus of MD 528 at the southern end of Ocean City north to MD 528 north of the downtown area of Ocean City.   Because MD 378 essentially functions as the northbound direction of MD 528 in downtown Ocean City, the state highway is covered in more detail in the main sections of this article. MD 378 has two auxiliary routes:  MD 378A is the designation for 1st Street, a   connector between MD 378 and MD 528 just north of US 50 in Ocean City. The state highway is one-way westbound, helping provide access to US 50 from traffic at the southern end of the barrier island.   MD 378B is the designation for 9th Street, a   connector between MD 378 and MD 528 on the northern edge of downtown Ocean City. MD 378B, which is one-way westbound, serves as the main conduit for MD 378 traffic headed for the central and northern parts of Ocean City along MD 528, connecting with MD 528 at the point the highway becomes two-way. For that reason, MD 378B is part of the National Highway System.     See also      References  External links   MD 528 @ MDRoads.com MD 378 @ MDRoads.com     
Fort Cumberland (Maryland)  Fort Cumberland (built 1754) was an 18th century frontier fort at the current site of Cumberland, Maryland, USA. It was an important military and economic center during the French and Indian War (1754–63) and figured significantly in the early career of George Washington. HistoryAt the current location of the city of Cumberland, Maryland, a crude frontier fort was constructed at the confluence of Wills Creek and the Potomac River in fall 1754 by troops of the Maryland militia, under the command of Captain John Dagworthy, and under the overall command of Colonel James Innes, the commander-in-chief of colonial forces at that time.  Initially named Fort Mount Pleasant, it was renamed Fort Cumberland in 1755.  Ft Cumberland figured prominently in the French & Indian War in 1755, when it became a rally point for British forces under command of  General Braddock. The wood palisade fort is now gone, and occupying the site is the existing Emmanuel Episcopal Church, but the old fort tunnels still remain underneath.This fort once marked the westernmost outpost of the British Empire in America, and was the jumping-off point for General Braddock's disastrous expedition against the French at Fort Duquesne. When Braddock was killed, a young officer of Virginia militia, George Washington, lead the troops back to Fort Cumberland. At the fort, Washington clashed with Captain Dagworthy over the issue of military rank and which colonial officer should be in command: Washington was a Major in the Virginia militia, outranking the Maryland Captain, but Dagworthy countered that because he also held a Royal commission as a Captain in the Regulars (British Army), he automatically outranked any colonial militia officer.   DescriptionIn May 1755, one of the British officers with General Braddock described the newly-christened Fort Cumberland: "[It] is situated within 200 yards of Will's Creek, on a hill and about 400 from the Potomack; its length from east to west is about 200 yards, and breadth 46 yards, and is built by logs driven into the ground, and about 12 feet above it." Eleven days later, he reported that 100 carpenters were at work building a magazine and constructing a bridge over Will's Creek.  Diagrams and drawings of the Fort exist in the British Museum.

Maryland Route 648  Maryland Route 648 (MD 648) is a collection of state highways in the U.S. state of Maryland. These nine highways are current or former sections of the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard between Annapolis and Baltimore via Glen Burnie. There are five signed mainline segments of MD 648 through Arnold, Severna Park, Pasadena, Glen Burnie, Ferndale, and Pumphrey in northern Anne Arundel County; Baltimore Highlands in southern Baltimore County; and the independent city of Baltimore. MD 648 mainly serves local traffic along its meandering route, with long-distance traffic intended to use the parallel and straighter MD 2 south of Glen Burnie and freeway-grade Interstate 97, I-695, and MD 295 between Glen Burnie and Baltimore.The Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was constructed in the early to mid-1910s as the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis. The highway was specifically authorized by the Maryland General Assembly, which insisted the Maryland State Roads Commission complete the highway along its originally planned route instead of using what is now MD 2 north of Glen Burnie. The boulevard was designated parts of MD 2 and MD 3 in 1927; the latter number was replaced with U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in 1939. MD 648 was assigned to the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard south of Glen Burnie in the late 1930s after it was functionally replaced by MD 2's present course. In the late 1950s, after US 301 was moved to freeways from south of Glen Burnie to Baltimore, MD 648 was extended north from Glen Burnie into Baltimore. MD 648 has had few major changes since then, the most significant being relocations between Pasadena and Glen Burnie in the 1970s. Route descriptionThere are five mainline segments of MD 648.  MD 648A runs   from MD 450 just east of the Severn River at Annapolis to a dead end located just south of US 50 and US 301 near Arnold. MD 648F has a length of   from a ramp from westbound US 50 and US 301 immediately to the north of MD 648A's terminus to MD 2 in Arnold. MD 648D extends   between intersections with MD 2 in Arnold and Severna Park. MD 648H runs   from MD 2 in Severna Park north to MD 177 in Pasadena. MD 648E has a length of   from MD 177 in Pasadena north to MD 295 in the city of Baltimore.   Annapolis–Arnold MD 648A begins at an intersection with MD 450 (Governor Ritchie Highway) just east of the Naval Academy Bridge that crosses the Severn River into the city of Annapolis. The state highway heads east and immediately intersects the access road for Jonas Green State Park, which is unsigned MD 648AB. At the junction with MD 672 (Greenbury Point Road), which serves several facilities of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Naval Academy, MD 648 turns north and meets the west end of MD 179 (Saint Margarets Road). The state highway continues north through a forested residential area to its terminus at a dead end just south of US 50 and US 301, which run concurrently as Blue Star Memorial Highway.   The westbound direction of the freeway has a right-in/right-out intersection with MD 648F directly opposite from the dead end of MD 648A. MD 648F heads west parallel to the freeway then turns north to a partial intersection with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway). There is no access from northbound MD 648F to southbound MD 2.     Arnold–Severna Park There are two county-maintained segments of Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard on the southbound and northbound sides, respectively, of MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) through Arnold. MD 648D begins at an intersection with MD 2 in Arnold a short distance north of the second county highway loop. The state highway parallels the southbound direction of MD 2 and the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail, which the highway follows closely except close to its termini. On the northern end of Arnold, MD 648 and MD 2 approach closely; within this stretch there is a spur from MD 648 to southbound MD 2 and a spur from both directions of MD 2 to MD 648. The state highway leaves the vicinity of MD 2 then splits from the rail trail to its northern terminus at an oblique intersection with MD 2 within a commercial area in Severna Park.     Severna Park–Pasadena MD 648H begins at an intersection with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Severna Park. The state highway heads east, crossing Cattail Creek before intersecting Asbury Drive, which is unsigned MD 648AA.  MD 648 veers north through residential subdivisions in Pasadena.  The state highway passes along the eastern edge of Waterford Park, where the highway crosses the Magothy River just downstream from its impoundment, Lake Waterford.  Just north of the lake, Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard veers to the northwest as unsigned MD 915. MD 648 continues north as Waterford Road.  The state highway crosses over MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway) with no access before reaching its northern terminus at MD 177 (Mountain Road).     Pasadena–Baltimore MD 648E, which is the longest section of MD 648, is mostly located in Anne Arundel County; a small portion of the highway passes through the southeastern corner of Baltimore County before heading into Baltimore, where the highway is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation. MD 648 has freeway connections with MD 10 and I-97 in Glen Burnie, I-695 in Ferndale, and MD 295 in Baltimore. The state highway is a part of the National Highway System between I-97 and the entrance to the Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie station of the Baltimore Light Rail. MD 648E begins at an intersection with MD 177 (Mountain Road) and Jumpers Hole Road at Lipins Corner near Pasadena, about   west of the intersection of MD 177 and MD 648H. This intersection is a short distance to the east of MD 177's partial interchanges with MD 10 and MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Highway) and the highway's western terminus at MD 2. MD 648 heads north as a three-lane road with center turn lane through residential subdivisions. The state highway expands to a five-lane road with center turn lane as it curves to the west, crosses Marley Creek, and intersects MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road); the south leg of that intersection is unsigned MD 648G, which is also named Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard. MD 648 temporarily becomes a four-lane divided highway through its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 10 (Arundel Expressway).   MD 648 reduces to two lanes as it passes through a residential neighborhood in Glen Burnie. The state highway curves to the northwest through a commercial area in the center of the suburb where the highway intersects MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) and MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway).  MD 648 expands to a four-lane undivided highway at its intersection with Eighth Avenue and MD 176 (Dorsey Road), which heads west toward Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. The state highway begins to parallel the Baltimore Light Rail and its southern terminal station, Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie. North of the station, MD 648 becomes divided and has a folded diamond interchange with I-97.  MD 648 continues to parallel the transit line as a two-lane road north through Ferndale. The state highway passes the Ferndale station in the center of the community. MD 648 veers north away from the transit line at Hollins Ferry Road, then passes North County High School and crosses Cabin Branch. The state highway intersects Furnace Branch Road and the eastern end of MD 169 (Maple Road) prior to meeting I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. In the center of Pumphrey, MD 648 intersects MD 170, which heads northeast as Belle Grove Road and southwest as Camp Meade Road past the North Linthicum light rail station. The state highway passes under the Baltimore Light Rail tracks and begins to parallel them. MD 648 intersects MD 168 (Nursery Road) just west of the Nursery Road station shortly before the highway veers away from the transit line and crosses the Patapsco River.  MD 648 continues north as Old Annapolis Road, crossing under I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) with no access before passing through the suburb of Baltimore Highlands in the southeastern corner of Baltimore County.   The state highway enters the city of Baltimore and its name changes to Annapolis Road shortly before intersecting Patapsco Avenue. MD 648 crosses over MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway) and under the Curtis Bay Branch of CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision. The state highway intersects ramps to and from the southbound parkway as it passes to the east of Mount Auburn Cemetery. MD 648 has a pair of intersections with Waterview Avenue on both sides of an east–west segment to cross to the east side of MD 295. The state highway passes through the Westport neighborhood, where Wenburn Street and Manokin Street lead west to ramps with the northbound and southbound directions of the parkway, respectively. MD 648 meets a pair of rail lines at grade, intersects Monroe Street, and passes under I-95 before crossing over Gwynns Falls. The state highway reaches its northern terminus at a right-in/right-out interchange with the ramp from northbound I-95 to northbound MD 295, which continues north as Russell Street toward Downtown Baltimore.   History Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard constructedIn 1910, the Maryland General Assembly authorized funding for the construction of a boulevard between Annapolis and Baltimore. This boulevard, which would have a minimum road width of  , would begin in Annapolis, cross the Severn River, head northwest to Glen Burnie, and continue through Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties to the tracks of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in South Baltimore. The newly formed Maryland State Roads Commission was placed in charge of constructing the new Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard.  The boulevard was constructed as a   wide macadam road from the Severn River north to Arnold and from Severna Park to Pasadena in 1910 and 1911. The sections between Arnold and Severna Park and from Pasadena to Glen Burnie were completed in 1912.   The boulevard followed much of what is today MD 648, with the major difference being in Pasadena, where instead of following Waterford Road north to MD 177, the boulevard headed northwest along what are discontinuous segments of MD 915 to Lipins Corner. Unrelated to the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard, the commission constructed a   wide macadam road from Glen Burnie to Brooklyn, which was then in Anne Arundel County. In Brooklyn, the new highway connected with the south end of the Light Street Bridge that crossed the Patapsco River into Baltimore.  The first section of the highway between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore was an   wide macadam road that had been started in 1909, prior to the 1910 act.  This highway was completed in 1911 from the Western Maryland Railway crossing in Westport, then part of Anne Arundel County, south to the English Consul Estate, which is now the community of Baltimore Highlands.   With a road completed from Annapolis to Baltimore, the roads commission suggested that it should not be required to complete a road between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The commission asked the Maryland General Assembly to pass a bill releasing the commission from the responsibility of completing the highway from Glen Burnie to South Baltimore. However, the Maryland General Assembly disagreed with the Maryland State Roads Commission and passed a bill in 1914 requiring the commission to finish the boulevard between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was constructed as a   wide concrete road from Glen Burnie to Pumphrey and from the Patapsco River to the English Consul Estate in 1914 and 1915. The northernmost part of the boulevard was constructed as a   wide street surfaced with asphalt, bricks, and granite blocks from Westport into the city, where the highway followed Russell Street, Bush Street, and Ridgely Street to the B&O Railroad crossing southwest of the present location of M&T Bank Stadium.  The final section of the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was completed in 1916 as a   wide concrete road from Pumphrey to the Patapsco River. This segment included a   wide,   high underpass of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway at Pumphrey completed the same year.   Improvements and redesignationThe entire length of the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was widened to   with a pair of   wide concrete shoulders by 1927. The highway's bridge over Marley Creek was rebuilt from a width of   to   in 1926.  When the Maryland State Roads Commission first assigned numbers to state highways in 1927, the boulevard from Annapolis to Glen Burnie was designated MD 2, and the highway from Glen Burnie to Baltimore via Pumphrey was designated MD 3.  In 1930, a concrete cut-off was built in Glen Burnie that allowed MD 2 traffic to bypass the community's central intersection to the northeast.  By 1933, Russell Street was extended south from Bush Street to Waterview Avenue in Baltimore.  MD 3 was relocated onto Russell Street from Annapolis Road, bypassing the Westport neighborhood, by 1936. In 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended expanding Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard to at least   in width for its entire length, with a width of   urged from MD 177 to MD 3 and on MD 2 from the center of Glen Burnie to Furnace Branch.  The first portion of Governor Ritchie Highway was completed as a four-lane divided upgrade to existing MD 2 from the Baltimore city limit in Brooklyn Park to Furnace Branch in 1934 and 1935.  Construction on the remainder of Governor Ritchie Highway began in 1936 and was completed south from Furnace Branch to the Severn River in 1938.   All old segments of MD 2 were redesignated MD 648 by 1939.  This includes the portion of Robert Crain Highway from Glen Burnie to Furnace Branch that is now the northern part of MD 3 Business.  That same year, MD 3 was replaced by US 301 through Southern Maryland and along Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard from Glen Burnie to Baltimore.  During World War II, the Waterford Road section of MD 648 was built as MD 706 and the Pumphrey grade separation with the defunct WB&A Railway was dismantled and the road widened.   In 1949, the portion of MD 648 on Robert Crain Highway was widened and resurfaced, shortly before it was replaced with US 301 Alternate, which ran concurrently with MD 2 from Furnace Branch into Baltimore.   US 301 proper was widened to   from the Baltimore city limits to Pumphrey in 1950 and from Pumphrey to Glen Burnie in 1951.   MD 648 was widened and resurfaced from US 301 in Glen Burnie south to MD 177 at Lipins Corner between 1954 and 1956.  The Glen Burnie Bypass (now I-97) was completed in 1956.   US 301 was moved from Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard to the Glen Burnie Bypass, the Expressway Connector that would become the Baltimore Beltway, and the Baltimore–Washington Expressway (now MD 295) into the city of Baltimore in 1957, two years before the US 301 was relocated to the Eastern Shore of Maryland and replaced with MD 3.   MD 648 was then extended from Glen Burnie through Pumphrey to its crossing of the Baltimore–Washington Expressway just north of the Baltimore city limits. MD 648 replaced MD 706 on Waterford Road when MD 100 was completed in 1971; the old segments of MD 648 became MD 915.  MD 648 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway at Marley Creek, including a new bridge over the creek, when the highway's interchange with MD 10 was built in 1976.    By 1977, MD 648 had been extended north in Baltimore to its present northern terminus.  The highway was expanded to a divided highway at its interchange with I-695 when the bridge over the Interstate was replaced in 1989.   The southern end of what is now MD 648H was relocated in Severna Park to cross Cattail Creek and have a perpendicular intersection with MD 2 in 1989; the old alignment along Asbury Drive became MD 648AA.   By 1999, the portions of Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard between US 50 and MD 648D in Arnold had been transferred to county maintenance, and all segments of MD 648 existed as they do today.

Piney Orchard, Maryland Piney Orchard, is a community within Odenton, Maryland. Piney Orchard was begun as a Planned Unit Development, and was a project of the Constellation Real Estate Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Constellation Energy Group, which itself, is now owned by Exelon.Construction of the community began in 1991, although groundbreaking for what was to become the Nature Preserve started in 1987, when Constellation Real Estate Group began the effort to restore wetlands in an area which had been mined for sand and gravel in the 1940s and 1950s.  Several mitigation projects, the term used for this restoration, followed in five phases to replace wetlands filled in by the development of the community, and included the building and enhancement of five large ponds and the planting of shrubs, trees, and grasses native to the area. The Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees such efforts, monitored the progress of the mitigation sites until 1995, when it was determined the efforts had been successful. In 1996, the Piney Orchard Nature Preserve was officially opened.More than 3500 housing units have been built in Piney Orchard and approximately 8500 residents live there.  Constellation turned over the day-to-day supervision of Piney Orchard to the homeowners of the community in 2005.  The Piney Orchard Community Association, or "POCA" as it is known, arranges several community-wide social activities and collects annual fees from all homeowners to maintain the aesthetic qualities of the community.Piney Orchard Ice Arena, located at the corner of Piney Orchard Boulevard and Riverscape Drive, had been the practice site for the Washington Capitals ice hockey team until 2006, when they moved to their newly-built practice facility, Kettler Capitals Iceplex in Arlington, Virginia.

Raljon, Maryland Raljon, Maryland is a place name for the area around FedEx Field (originally called Jack Kent Cooke Stadium), near Landover, Maryland, where the Washington Redskins play.  Former Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke derived the name from the names of his sons, Ralph and John.   Introduced in 1997 to almost universal derision, the name enjoyed almost no currency beyond the Redskins and the United States Postal Service, which formally recognized the name.Tony Kornheiser famously said "Lucky for us, Cooke didn't name his kids Peter and Ennis." Daniel Snyder discontinued the use of the name in 1999 when he bought the Redskins.  The Redskins' official Web site now gives the location of FedExField as Landover.

Muirkirk, Maryland   Muirkirk is an unincorporated area in northern Prince George's County, Maryland, United States, located between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. in the central part of the state. It is located along U.S. 1 between Beltsville and Laurel.  It has a stop on the MARC commuter rail (on the Camden line). HistoryMuirkirk was the historic location of Muirkirk Furnace, from which the area takes its name.  The ironworks were established before the American Civil War.  After the conflict began, the US government hired a manager from the North to ensure the works were kept under federal control.Located along Old Muirkirk Road near Muirkirk station is the historic African-American community of Rossville, originally composed mostly of families of men who labored at the ironworks.  It has existed for more than 100 years.  In 1868 after the Civil War, six black men purchased property for a church and cemetery, forming the Queens Chapel Methodist Episcopal Church in the rural enclave colloquially referred to as "Swamp Poodle."  Part of the property was already in use as a burial ground. They intended to use the church building, originally a small log structure, as a school for their children. This was the start of a postwar cohesive black community in which freedmen established a church independent of white supervision. Around 1885, the estate of landowner Mark Duvall, who owned considerable property in the Vansville area, provided for the sale of   just east of Queen's Chapel.  The twelve lots made available were quickly settled by African Americans, many of whom worked at nearby Muirkirk Furnace.  Augustus Ross, after whom the community was named, built one of the first houses.The largest lot was purchased by Rebecca Lodge #6, Benevolent Sons and Daughters of Abraham, a black fraternal organization whose members established the historic Abraham Hall.  The lodge hall functioned for years as the community school for black children, as the state had segregated facilities.  In 1922 the black community raised matching funds and gained white school board members' approval to build a Rosenwald School to improve the educational facilities for black children.  Historically black schools were underfunded.

Maryland Scroll   The Maryland Scroll is an American Civil War artifact.  It consists of a pencil drawing of a scroll with an unfurling banner above it.  It was drawn on March 16, 1863 by one or more unknown members of James Breathed's Battery on the wall of the Graffiti House, in Brandy Station, Virginia. Scroll contentsThe unfurling banner (also known as the horizontal scroll) reads: "Rifle Gun" and "No. 1, Stuart Horse Artillery / Breathed's Battery / On Picket - March 16, 1863"The main scroll, or vertical scroll lists the names of the fourteen soldiers in the artillery unit, as well as officers Sgt. Henry Thomas and Cpl. F. Gibson.The other names on the scroll (which are numbered 1 to 14) in order: George W. McCabe, H. Hopkins, S. Owens, H Greenwell, H. Wagner, E. Russell, W. Hopkins, F. Yates, A Muth, B. Evans, H. Wickes, W. Evans, U. Haller, and H. Boyd.On March 17, 1863, the day after the scroll was created, the men named on it fought at the Battle of Kelly's Ford. HistoryUsed as a hospital and meeting place by both Union and Confederate armies during the Civil War, the house now known as the Graffiti House was near demolition in 1993.  When salvage efforts uncovered the extensive historical graffiti in the upper floor of the house, the Maryland Scroll was removed from the wall and placed in a private collection of Civil War memorabilia.  The people of nearby Culpeper, Virginia sought to have the scroll returned to the Graffiti House, and this was accomplished in January 2004 after the acquisition of the scroll by the Brandy Station Foundation.  The scroll currently sits in a glass case in the house's "South Room", with a photograph on the wall showing its original position. References  Brandy Station Foundation website

Lansdowne, Maryland   Lansdowne is a census-designated place in southern Baltimore County, Maryland, just south of Baltimore city. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 8,409.    At the 2000 census and earlier, the area was delineated as part of the Lansdowne-Baltimore Highlands CDP. HistoryIn the late 1800s, the Whitaker Iron Company mined for ore in Lansdowne. Abandoned pits from the mining were filled up by underground springs creating small ponds and lakes. Lansdowne was mostly farmland, including the Kessler farm, MacLeod farm and Wades farm.When the railroad came, Lansdowne became known as a B&O town. Most people worked for the B&O, commuting by train into Baltimore City.  The first station was named Coursey Station. The Coursey Station senior housing center takes its name from this.The two main roads were Hammonds Ferry Road and Hollins Ferry Road, both of which led to the Patapsco River where you could take a ferry across to the other side.Early churches included the Lutheran Church of Our Savior, St. Clements Catholic Church, Lansdowne United Methodist Church, Lansdowne Christian Church and the First Baptist Church. The Hull Memorial Christian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.    The site of the original wooden school house was on the property that is now St. Clements.In the 1950s housing developments sprang up in the Riverview area, and new schools were built for these neighborhoods. The Lansdowne Elementary School, Lansdowne Middle School and Lansdowne Senior High were known as the "Golden Education Triangle."In the early 1960s the B&O closed the railroad crossing and Lansdowne Boulevard was constructed, connecting Lansdowne to Washington Boulevard, bridging over the railroad tracks. A tunnel was also constructed under the tracks for pedestrian crossing.  However, the railroad crossing effectively divided the community into two separate parts. Some old railroad cars were erected as a museum and shopping area alongside Hammonds Ferry Road and the railroad tracks. In the 1980s Baltimore County Recreation and Parks opened a large parcel of land for public use. Southwest Area Park is located on the Patapsco River, just below Baltimore Highlands.A small library was built by Baltimore County in 1966, on Third Avenue. In 1993, the Lansdowne Library was closed due to budget cutbacks. The building is now used as the Police Athletic League Center. In 1989 the Lansdowne/Baltimore Highlands Senior Center was built directly behind the Library building. The library reopened on April 8, 2006 with much support from the Lansdowne Improvement Association. The Lansdowne Improvement Association has been instrumental in much community support, pride and beautification.  With a grant from Baltimore Community Foundation they were able to have a gateway sign installed welcoming visitors to the community of Lansdowne as well as Baltimore Highlands and Riverview. On November 5, 2007, Lansdowne Station opened, which is a business and retail center located on Washington Boulevard.  It features a Walmart Supercenter, Petco, Office Depot, small retail shops, sandwich and pizza restaurants as well as an office complex.   GeographyLansdowne is located at   (39.2431, -76.6585).   It is bounded to the northeast by the border of Baltimore City, to the northwest by the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (now CSX Transportation), separating the area from Arbutus to the west, to the south by the Patapsco River, which forms the boundary with Anne Arundel County, and to the east by the Baltimore–Washington Parkway, separating Lansdowne from Baltimore Highlands to the east.According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of  , of which   is land and  , or 5.30%, is water.  Roads Lansdowne RoadLansdowne Road is a main road which travels through Lansdowne into South Baltimore (city). The road starts at Hollins Ferry Road and travels west past Lansdowne High School to Hammonds Ferry Road, then to Washington Boulevard. Hollins Ferry RoadThe road starts at Halethorpe Farms Road in the Halethorpe area and proceeds east across I-695, then crosses the Baltimore (city) line after passing Lansdowne Road/Daisy Avenue to Patapsco Avenue, ending at US-1/Washington Boulevard. Hammonds Ferry RoadHammonds Ferry Road starts at Andover Road in Linthicum Heights in Anne Arundel County, then travels north, crossing the county line into Lansdowne and passing under the Baltimore Beltway and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway. It then hits Hollins Ferry Road and continues until it reaches Caton Avenue/Patapsco Avenue. DemographicsAs of the census  of 2010, there were 8,409 people, 3,057 households, and 2,132 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 3,513 people per square mile (1,356/km²).

Baltimore Highlands, Maryland     Baltimore Highlands is a census-designated place (CDP) in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, directly south of the city of Baltimore. The population was 7,019 at the 2010 census.    At the 2000 census and earlier, the area was delineated as part of the Lansdowne-Baltimore Highlands CDP. History  In the area known as Baltimore Highlands is a legendary mansion called English Consul. The land and house were owned by William Dawson, the first English Consul to Maryland. One legend claims that Dawson had a brother who was transported from England to America in disgrace. Each year he was to receive a whip lashing as punishment for the crime he had committed. This took place on the English Consul estate. Another legend has it that the mansion was a stop on the Underground Railroad before the Civil War. In 1909 a developer purchased the estate. It was eventually divided into the areas known as Baltimore Highlands, Rosemont, Friendship Gardens and the small section still called English Consul.In the 1980s Baltimore County Recreation and Parks opened a large parcel of land for public use. Southwest Area Park is located on the Patapsco River just below Baltimore Highlands. GeographyBaltimore Highlands is located at   (39.2359, -76.6374).

Enchanted Forest (Maryland)     The Enchanted Forest is a now-closed theme park in Ellicott City, Maryland, on U.S. Route 40 (Baltimore National Pike) near the intersection with Bethany Lane. Other theme parks with the same name have since opened elsewhere.The Enchanted Forest officially opened on August 15, 1955, following a preview party the afternoon before — one month after Disneyland Park's opening.  Appealing mostly to families with small children, the park had a nursery rhyme theme.  The park featured fairy tale buildings and characters, but no mechanical rides originally.  Track rides were added later, including the Alice in Wonderland ride with teacup-shaped cars, a Cinderella's castle ride with mice for the cars, the "Little Toot" boat that took children to Mount Vesuvius for giant slides, and the Jungleland Safari which was driven by open Land Rover-type vehicles.  Children's birthday parties were often held in the picnic areas among the attractions; many local teenagers worked as ticket-takers at the park.  Unlike many other attractions of the time, the Enchanted Forest was integrated from the day it opened.   : "Unlike Baltimore’s popular streetcar amusement parks—Gwynn Oak, Carlin’s Park, and Bay Shore—the Enchanted Forest was integrated from the beginning." Admission was one dollar for adults and fifty cents for children.  At opening, the park was  , but it later expanded to  .  At the height of its popularity, the Enchanted Forest welcomed 300,000 children per summer season.  After its original owners, the Harrison family, sold the park for $4.5 million to JHP Development in 1988, the park closed for the first time in 1989. After turning more than half the land (primarily the parking lots) into the Safeway-anchored Enchanted Forest Shopping Center in 1992, JHP Development reopened the park for the 1994 summer season, predominantly for children's birthday parties.From when the park was permanently shuttered in 1995, to 2005 when active preservation began, much of the theme park sat undisturbed yet neglected behind a chain-link fence. In 1999, the Friends of the Enchanted Forest was formed with the goal of reopening the park and then in 2003 the Enchanted Forest Preservation Society was formed with the long-term goal of reviving the Enchanted Forest.  Their work focused on preventing the artifacts from being lost forever. The owner of the land, Kimco Realty Group, agreed in 2004 to allow most of the fairy tale structures and figures to be moved to nearby Clark's Elioak Farm for display and preservation. Moving and restoration began in 2005. Contributions were still being welcomed in 2011, although many of the exhibits had been restored and returned to service at the farm. Appearances in popular culture   Part of the John Waters movie Cry-Baby, released in April 1990 and starring Johnny Depp and Ricki Lake, took place in the Enchanted Forest.  The entrance to the park was used to begin the scene, but most of the interior scenes of the park were actually shot at Hershey Park, in nearby Hershey, PA. It appears in the horror movie Fear Of Clowns. Episode 45 of the TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (season 4), titled "The Hat", was filmed at the Enchanted Forest. The 2009 novel Closed for the Season by Mary Downing Hahn was inspired by Hahn's trips to the Enchanted Forest. Photos of the park appear on the book's cover.

2001 Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. tornado outbreak   The Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., tornado outbreak of 2001 was the most dramatic recent tornado event to directly affect the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area in the United States.   The outbreak occurred on September 24, 2001, and was responsible for two deaths and 57 injuries. The first tornado of the outbreak was also the strongest - an F4 (see Fujita scale) tornado that left a 10-mile-long damage path through rural Culpeper and Fauquier Counties in Virginia.  Weak (F1) tornadoes east of Warrenton, and just west of Dulles International Airport soon followed.A second supercell to the southeast spawned the family of tornadoes that moved through Washington.  A first tornado (F0) was confirmed in the Quantico, and nearby Prince William Forest Park areas; this was soon followed by an F1 tornado that left a 15-mile-long path parallel to I-95 and I-395 through Franconia, western Alexandria, and southeastern Arlington.  This tornado dissipated near the west end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and was followed by many reports of funnel clouds.The same storm soon produced a violent, multiple-vortex F3 tornado in College Park, Maryland.  This storm moved at peak intensity through the University of Maryland, College Park campus, and then moved parallel to I-95 through the Beltsville, Maryland, area, where the tornado caused extensive damage to greenhouses and other facilities of the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center.  The storm continued on to Laurel, Maryland, where F3 damage was also noted.  The damage path from this storm was measured at 17.5 miles in length, and this tornado caused two deaths and 55 injuries, along with $101 million in property damage.The two deaths at College Park were Colleen and Erin Marlatt, who died when their car was picked up by the tornado near the Easton Hall dormitory and thrown into a tree in a parking area.

Hanover, Maryland     Hanover, Maryland is a locality in unincorporated northwestern Anne Arundel County, Maryland in the United States, located south of Baltimore near the Howard County line.It is located approximately at the intersection of Maryland State Highway 100 and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. It is part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and is located just southwest of the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (commonly known as "BWI").Hanover was largely unknown prior to the opening of the Arundel Mills mall in November 2000. Since then, the area has seen explosive growth; shopping centers and housing developments have popped up along Arundel Mills Boulevard (Route 713), which links the B-W Parkway and Route 100 to Arundel Mills. On November 2, 2010, Anne Arundel County voters approved zoning for a gaming and entertainment complex with 4,750 slot machines at Arundel Mills Mall. This casino complex opened as Maryland Live! in June 2012. The Maryland Department of Transportation is headquartered at 7201 Corporate Center Drive, which has a Hanover address.

Piscataway, Maryland   Piscataway is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.  It is one of the oldest European-colonized communities in the state.  The Piscataway Creek provided sea transportation for export of tobacco.Piscataway was created in 1706 when the colonial Maryland Legislature authorized surveying and laying out the towns of Queen Anne Town, Nottingham, Mill Town, Piscataway, Aire (also known as Broad Creek) and Upper Marlboro (then known as Marlborough Town).         In 1747, the legislature tried to improve the quality and the method of marketing tobacco, then the major crop of the area.  It established a formal system of tobacco inspection and quality control. The town was home to one of seven state tobacco warehouses built in Prince George's County.  A "Committee of Correspondence" plotted local actions for the American Revolution in Piscataway. One famous resident was William Marbury, involved in a famous early Supreme Court case.       During Prohibition in the 1920s, the area was known for the production and sale of moonshine.  Some of the product was moved by boat to other areas along the Chesapeake Bay.  The creek is now silted in and no longer navigable.The St. Mary's Catholic Church, school, and cemetery are a prominent feature of the community.  The complex includes the small 1904 church and a larger 1988 sanctuary. Its parish boundaries cover the largest territory of any Catholic parish in the Archdiocese of Washington, including portions of five separate postal towns/communities.A number of historic houses still survive in the middle of the little town, including a former hotel/tavern, although the last business (a small store) closed in the 1970s. A large development called "The Preserve" is partially opened and is eventually planned to have 1,100 single-family homes.  A short bypass road recently opened around the community.The poem "The Sot-Weed Factor," by Ebenezer Cooke, mentions details of life in Piscataway during ancient times. The same subject was the subject of a novel by the same name by John Barth.  References  Further reading  Along the Potomac Shore in Prince Georges County (local history book)            
Maryland Route 175  Maryland Route 175 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs   from Little Patuxent Parkway in Columbia east to MD 3 in Millersville. MD 175 is a major highway through the large unincorporated town of Columbia; the highway connects U.S. Route 29 (US 29) next to Columbia Town Center with Interstate 95 (I-95) and an industrial area on the eastern side of Howard County. MD 175 also connects Fort Meade with Jessup and Odenton in western Anne Arundel County, where it links MD 295 and MD 32 with the eastern part of the U.S. Army base. MD 175 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal freight transport connector from I-95 to Dorsey Run Road in Jessup. MD 175 was constructed from Ellicott City to Millersville in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of three routes: MD 531 from MD 103 near Ellicott City to US 1 near Jessup, MD 175 from there to Fort Meade and north to Hanover, and MD 180 from Odenton to Millersville. The highway did not originally extend through Fort Meade; MD 175 was constructed through the military installation in the early 1940s as part of major upgrades to the highway from Jessup to Odenton due to its strategic importance. By 1946, MD 175 extended from Ellicott City to Millersville. The highway was widened from Odenton to Millersville in the late 1940s and from Ellicott City to Odenton in the mid-1950s. MD 175 was relocated at I-95 around 1970 and as a major highway through the newly constructed community of Columbia in the mid-1970s. The old portion of the highway from Ellicott City to the new highway became MD 108 and MD 104. There are plans to expand MD 175 to a multi-lane divided highway through Fort Meade due to increased activity at the Army post. Route descriptionMD 175 begins just west of its bridges over the Little Patuxent River. The highway continues southwest as Little Patuxent Parkway, the county-maintained six-lane divided highway that forms the main street of Columbia Town Center. MD 175 heads east as Rouse Parkway, a four-lane divided controlled access highway; the highway was renamed from Little Patuxent Parkway to honor Columbia founder James Rouse and his wife Patty in 2006.  The highway immediately has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). MD 175 heads southeast through intersections with Thunder Hill Road, Tamar Drive, and Dobbin Road as it passes between the Columbia villages of Oakland Mills to the southwest and Long Reach to the northeast. The state highway expands to six lanes at Dobbin Road and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Snowden River Parkway and a trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive. Access from eastbound MD 175 to Columbia Gateway Drive requires using the Snowden River Parkway interchange. MD 175 widens to eight lanes at Columbia Gateway Drive, a width the highway carries through its intersection with the eastern end of MD 108 (Waterloo Road) to the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. The highway's name changes from Rouse Parkway to Waterloo Road at the MD 108 junction. MD 175 has six lanes from I-95 to east of its junction with US 1 (Washington Boulevard), which was the site of a tavern called Waterloo and before that Spurrier's Tavern.  MD 175 drops to two lanes as it passes between the Maryland Wholesale Produce Distribution Center to the southwest and the Patuxent Institution on the northeast and enters Jessup. East of Dorsey Run Road, which leads to the Jessup Auto Distribution Center, the state highway crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision and enters Anne Arundel County, where the highway's name changes to Jessup Road. East of the tracks, MD 175 meets the eastern end of unsigned MD 723 (Old Jessup Road), which accesses the Jessup station on MARC's Camden Line, which uses the Capital Subdivision tracks. The highway continues east past the former Maryland House of Correction and has a cloverleaf interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway), where the highway's name becomes Annapolis Road. MD 175 temporarily expands to four lanes at its intersection with MD 713, which heads south as Rockenbach Road into Fort Meade and north as Ridge Road toward Hanover. The highway passes through the eastern part of Fort Meade and expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane at Reece Road, which becomes MD 174 on the eastern boundary of the military installation.  At the southeastern corner of the fort, MD 175 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway) and enters Odenton. The highway crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and meets the southern end of MD 170 (Telegraph Road); the south leg of the intersection, Piney Orchard Parkway, leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line, which uses the Amtrak tracks. MD 175 continues as a four-lane undivided highway to a five-legged roundabout at the eastern end of Odenton where the highway meets Odenton Road, Higgins Drive, and Sappington Station Road, which is unsigned MD 32AA. The highway continues as a two-lane road past Arundel High School and through the village of Gambrills before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway) west of Millersville. MD 175 has separate intersections with southbound and northbound MD 3; Millersville Road continues east from the northbound intersection through the eponymous village and past the historic Childs Residence.   HistoryThe first section of MD 175 was constructed between 1924 and 1926 as a macadam road from US 1 southeast to the entrance of the Maryland House of Correction east of the B&O Railroad (now CSX) in Jessup.   MD 175 was extended as a concrete road east to its modern intersection with MD 713, then northeast along what later became MD 713 to MD 176 in Hanover in 1929.    The easternmost portion of MD 175, which was originally MD 180, was constructed as a concrete road starting in 1930 from MD 3 to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) in Odenton; the highway was complete west to Gambrills by the end of 1930.    The original western part of MD 175, from US 1 in Jessup to MD 103 in Ellicott City, was constructed as MD 531 in 1932.    The portion of the highway through Fort Meade was a public highway maintained by Anne Arundel County or the federal government through World War II.  MD 180's crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad was constructed in 1938.   The highway was relocated through Odenton using the new bridge in 1938 and 1939; the old road became MD 677.   MD 175's bridge over the B&O Railroad in Jessup was completed in 1942.   The highway was widened to a   wide road with a concrete base and asphalt surface from Jessup to the MD 713 intersection in 1942.  MD 175 was also extended as a   road through Fort Meade from MD 713 to west of Odenton between 1942 and 1944.   By 1946, MD 175 had been extended east over MD 180 to Millersville and west over MD 531 to Ellicott City; the portion of MD 175 from Fort Meade to MD 176 became MD 713.  MD 175 was widened from   from Odenton to Millersville starting in 1948.  The highway was widened and resurfaced from Odenton to the newly constructed Baltimore–Washington Expressway interchange in 1954.  MD 175 was also widened with curve amelioration from US 1 to MD 103 between 1954 and 1956.  MD 175's first divided highway section was created when the highway was relocated from US 1 to just north of the modern MD 108 intersection in conjunction with the construction of the I-95 interchange in 1969 and 1970.   The state highway's interchange with US 29 in Columbia was built in several stages. The westbound and eastbound bridges across the Little Patuxent River were built in 1970 and 1974, respectively.   The first parts of the interchange to open were the ramps between county-maintained Little Patuxent Parkway and southbound US 29.  MD 175's bridges over US 29 were built in 1974.  The interchange fully opened when the new Little Patuxent Parkway was completed from the existing highway at the present MD 108 interchange west to US 29 in 1977. The portion of MD 175 north of the new highway was replaced by an eastward extension of MD 108 and MD 104. The highway's trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive opened with Little Patuxent Parkway.  MD 175 was two lanes from US 29 to Columbia Gateway Drive until the road was expanded to a divided highway in 1987.  The highway's interchange with Snowden River Parkway was constructed in 2001.  MD 175's roundabout in Odenton was installed in 2004. The Maryland State Highway Administration plans to upgrade MD 175 from MD 295 in Jessup east to MD 170 in Odenton in response to the greatly increased traffic destined for Fort Meade due to the Base Realignment and Closure process. The state plans to expand MD 175 to a six-lane divided highway along the   stretch, construct intersection improvements at MD 713, Reece Road, Mapes Road, and Charter Oaks Boulevard, and reconstruct the MD 295 interchange.   One of the first projects to begin construction is improvements at the MD 713 intersection, which started in 2011 and are expected to be completed in 2013.  Junction list                                Auxiliary routes  MD 175AA is the designation for the   section of Max Blob Park Road from the intersection of MD 175 and Clark Road south to the portion of Max Blob Park Road designated MD 917 just east of the MD 175–MD 295 interchange in Jessup.   MD 175HC is the designation for the   eastbound collector/distributor roadway from Snowden River Parkway east to MD 175's bridge over Columbia Gateway Drive, where MD 175HC merges with eastbound MD 175, in Columbia. The highway allows eastbound MD 175 and Snowden River Parkway traffic to access Columbia Gateway Drive.   Prior to the completion of the interchange between MD 175 and Snowden River Parkway, MD 175HC began just east of the intersection of the two roads.

Maryland Route 170     Maryland Route 170 (MD 170) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs   from MD 175 in Odenton north to MD 2 in Brooklyn Park. MD 170 connects the western Anne Arundel County communities of Odenton and Severn and the North County communities of Linthicum, Pumphrey, and Brooklyn Park with Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport). The highway connects BWI Airport with Interstate 695 (I-695) and MD 100 and forms part of the Airport Loop, a circumferential highway that connects the airport and I-195 with many airport-related services. MD 170 includes two segments of the National Highway System that serve as intermodal passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. MD 170 originally served as the main highway between Baltimore and Fort George G. Meade. This highway, which included part of modern MD 174 west of Severn, was mostly constructed shortly after Camp Meade was established during World War I in the late 1910s. The Odenton–Severn portion of MD 170 was originally built as MD 554 in the 1930s, but became part of MD 170 in the mid-1940s. MD 170 went through another round of upgrades in the early 1940s due to its strategic importance during World War II. The highway originally passed through the area now occupied by BWI Airport. MD 170 was relocated north of MD 176 in the late 1940s during the construction of the airport and south of MD 176 in the late 1950s. The highway has been expanded to four lanes around its interchanges with I-195, I-695, MD 32, and MD 100 and along the perimeter of BWI Airport since the 1960s. Route descriptionMD 170 begins at an intersection with MD 175 (Annapolis Road) in Odenton. The highway continues south as county-maintained Piney Orchard Parkway, which leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line and the Piney Orchard community. MD 170 heads north on Telegraph Road, which begins as a four-lane divided highway but reduces to a two-lane road and passes through an industrial area. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway again shortly before its diamond interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). MD 170 continues north as a two-lane road with a center turn lane that crosses Severn Run. The center turn lane ends as the highway approaches the center of Severn. There, the highway intersects MD 174, which heads west as Reese Road and east as Donaldson Avenue. MD 170 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it approaches its single-point urban interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The highway becomes an undivided four-lane road between MD 100 and its intersection with MD 176 (Dorsey Road) at Harmans. The long ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 100 is unsigned MD 170A.  MD 170 continues north as Aviation Boulevard and joins the Airport Loop. The highway parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and the hiker-biker BWI Trail. MD 170 meets the eastern end of Stoney Run Road, which heads east and immediately loops back west and crosses over the state highway and the railroad on its way to the BWI Car Rental Facility. The highway intersects unsigned MD 995 (Amtrak Way), which leads to the BWI Rail Station, as it gradually curves to the east. MD 170 crosses Kitten Branch immediately before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-195 (Metropolitan Boulevard). The highway passes under the BWI Trail and expands to a divided highway before its intersection with Terminal Road and an at-grade intersection with the Baltimore Light Rail. Access to the rail line's BWI Business District station is via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection. MD 170 leaves the Airport Loop at its intersection with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), where the highway turns north onto Camp Meade Road.  MD 170 intersects the Baltimore Light Rail again and begins to parallel it as a two-lane road with a center turn lane. The light rail veers away to the east shortly before the highway's intersection with MD 762 (Andover Road), where the center turn lane ends. MD 170 enters Linthicum and intersects the light rail line a third time and begins to parallel it again shortly before the Linthicum station in the center of the community. The highway intersects MD 169 (Maple Road) and expands to a four-lane divided highway shortly before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). There is no access from MD 170 to eastbound I-695 or from westbound I-695 to MD 170. The highway reduces to a two-lane road again and passes the North Linthicum station just south of MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard) in the center of Pumphrey. MD 170 continues northeast as Belle Grove Road, which veers away from the light rail line. The highway parallels the Patapsco River and passes under I-895 Spur (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) before entering Brooklyn Park. There, MD 170 reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with MD 2, Jack Street, and Hanover Street at the Baltimore city limits. MD 2 heads south as Governor Ritchie Highway toward Glen Burnie and north into the city as Potee Street.   HistoryWhen the Maryland State Roads Commission applied numbers to state highways, they assigned MD 170 to its current corridor from Severn to Brooklyn Park and to what is now MD 174 from Severn to Fort Meade.   The portion of the modern highway from Odenton to Severn was originally MD 554.  Much of what was to become MD 170 was constructed along the Old Annapolis Road between Pumphrey and Severn. A portion of this road ran through the hamlet of Wellham Crossroads in the middle of what is now BWI Airport.  The highway was paved in macadam from the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard in Pumphrey to Hammonds Ferry Road in Linthicum by 1910. A second section of improved highway was planned by 1910 from Linthicum south to Wellham Crossroads.  A section of highway from the current MD 170–MD 174 intersection in Severn west to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak Northeast Corridor) was built as a   concrete road by 1915. Construction on the highway from Severn to Linthicum became a high priority with the United States' entrance into World War I; the remainder of the Severn–Linthicum highway and the highway from the railroad at Severn southwest to newly established Camp Meade, now collectively called the Camp Meade Road, were paved in   concrete between 1916 and 1919. Belle Grove Road from Pumphrey to Brooklyn Park was also paved in concrete in this period of time.    A poorly constructed portion of the Camp Meade Road between Wellham Crossroads and Dorsey Road was repaved with asphalt in 1919.  MD 170 was relocated at the railroad crossing when the highway's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed in 1931.   The old road, which is now Severn Station Road west of the tracks and Old Camp Meade Road to the east, became MD 483.  Telegraph Road from Severn to Odenton was built as a concrete road in three sections. The highway was constructed from the right-angle turn in the Camp Meade Road in Severn south to Evergreen Road in 1932 and 1933.   Another section of MD 554 was completed from Odenton Road (then MD 180 and later MD 677) in Odenton to a point north of Old Mill Road in 1936.    The gap in MD 554 was filled in or shortly after 1940.   MD 170 was widened to   from Brooklyn Park to Pumphrey in 1940.  With the outbreak of World War II, MD 170 was designated a road of strategic importance to connect Baltimore with Fort Meade; the highway was reconstructed as a   asphalt-surfaced concrete road in 1942.  By 1946, MD 170 and MD 554 had swapped numbers, with the former now the road from Severn to Odenton. MD 170 was relocated as a   road from MD 176 north to what is now the MD 170–MD 162 junction in 1947 and 1948 to make way for the construction of Friendship International Airport.     The highway's interchange with the Friendship International Airport Access Road, which was designated MD 46 and later became I-195, was started in 1950, the same year the airport opened, and completed in 1954.    South of the airport, MD 170 ran concurrently with MD 176 from the current MD 176–MD 652 intersection west to current MD 170A, which the highway used to connect with the modern alignment of MD 170.   The stub of MD 170 north from MD 176 to Friendship Cemetery on the airport reservation became MD 652.  MD 170 assumed its present alignment west of MD 170A when the highway was relocated from MD 176 south to the site of the MD 100 interchange as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway between 1958 and 1960.   The old alignment became much of current MD 652 and the portion of MD 652 north of MD 176 was transferred to county maintenance.  When the expressway spur between MD 168 and U.S. Route 301 (now MD 648) was built between 1951 and 1954, the expressway, which became part of the Baltimore Beltway, included an at-grade intersection with MD 170 between Linthicum and Pumphrey.   This junction was replaced with the present interchange in 1967; MD 170 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of the interchange in 1968.    MD 170's grade separation with Stoney Run Road on the west side of the airport was built in 1982.   The state highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from north of I-195 to MD 162 when the adjacent east–west portion of MD 162 was built in 1988.   MD 170 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with MD 100 when the single-point urban interchange was built in 1995.   MD 170 had been expanded to four lanes through its interchange with MD 32 and from MD 176 through the I-195 interchange, and had its southern terminus rolled back from MD 677 to MD 175, by 1999.  Junction list                                Auxiliary routeMD 170A is the designation for the   one-way ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 170 southwest of BWI Airport.

Western Shore of Maryland   Maryland's Western Shore (not to be confused with Western Maryland) is an area of Maryland west of the Chesapeake Bay.  The term does not identify an official region of Maryland, but it is often used in contrast to "Eastern Shore".  The Western Shore overlaps with the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and with Southern Maryland.Since it is not an officially defined region, there is no official border for the Western Shore but it can be taken to include the following counties, which border the Chesapeake Bay on the west:  Harford County Baltimore County Baltimore City Anne Arundel County Calvert County St. Mary's County  To residents of the Eastern Shore, the term "Western Shore" can refer to all of the counties of Maryland west of the Chesapeake Bay, particularly the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. Western Shore WatershedThe EPA defines the Western Shore as the land from Harford County down to Calvert County's bayfront communities.     Oxygen levels in the Chesapeake bay are a continuing concern.  As of 2010, the EPA is introducing new laws to reduce Western Shore nitrogen pollutants released into the bay from 16.89 million lbs per year to 9.74 million lbs per year. The laws would also restrict phosphorus pollutants from 830,000 lbs per year to 460,000 lbs per year.

United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006   The Maryland Congressional elections of 2006 were held on Tuesday, November 7, 2006.  The terms of all eight Representatives to the United States House of Representatives will expire on January 3, 2007, and therefore all were put up for contest. The winning candidates will serve a two-year term from January 3, 2007, to January 3, 2009. Overview  United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006   Party Votes Percentage +/– Seats +/–   Democratic 1,099,441 64.63% +6.46% 6 —   Republican 546,862 32.15% -7.62% 2 —   Green 42,857 2.52% +0.54% 0 —   Libertarian 4,941 0.29% +0.29% 0 —   Constitution 635 0.04% -0.04% 0 —   Others 6,466 0.38% +0.38% 0 —  Totals 1,701,202 100.00% - 8 —   District 1  Incumbent Republican Congressman Wayne Gilchrest, seeking his ninth term in Congress, faced Jim Corwin, the Democratic nominee and a family physician. Gilchrest's reputation as a moderate Republican built up his popularity and he was overwhelmingly re-elected in this conservative, Eastern Shore-based district.              District 2  In this heavily-gerrymandered and relatively liberal district, incumbent Democratic Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger faced no serious threat from Republican candidate Jimmy Mathis. Ruppersberger won a third term in this district that includes small parts of Baltimore and some of the Baltimore metropolitan area in a landslide.              District 3  Incumbent Democratic Congressman Ben Cardin declined to seek an eleventh term so that he could run for Senate. John Sarbanes, the son of retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes and an attorney, won a crowded Democratic primary and became the Democratic nominee. Annapolis marketing executive John White was Sarbanes's Republican nominee, and, true to the liberal nature of this district based in the Baltimore metropolitan area, Sarbanes beat White.                District 4  In this district, which has a majority African-American population and is based in Prince George's County and Montgomery County, is heavily liberal. Incumbent Democratic Congressman Al Wynn survived a tough primary challenge from lawyer Donna Edwards, and since the Democratic primary is tantamount to election, Wynn was the heavy favorite to win the general election, which he ultimately did.              District 5  House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who has served in Congress since he was elected in a 1981 special election to fill the seat previously held by Gladys Spellman, did not face a Republican opponent in this election. Hoyer's election to his fourteenth term was never in doubt, however, seeing as this district, based in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and southern Maryland, is heavily liberal. Hoyer beat out Green Party candidate Steve Warner and Constitution Party candidate Peter Kuhnert to win another term in Congress.                District 6  This district, based in the heavily conservative Maryland panhandle and the moderately conservative northern suburbs of Baltimore, has sent incumbent Republican Congressman Roscoe Bartlett back to Washington with solid margins of re-election, and this year proved no different. Congressman Bartlett faced United States Army veteran Andrew J. Duck in the general election, and though he ultimately beat Duck out, it was by a thinner margin than usual.                District 7  Incumbent Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings, who has represented this heavily liberal district based in Baltimore, Baltimore County and Howard County since previous Congressman Kweisi Mfume resigned in 1996. This year, the popular Cummings did not face any opponent of any kind in the general election and he coasted to a seventh term.            District 8  Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen, considered by many to be a rising star in the Democratic Party, has represented this staunchly liberal district based in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area since his initial election in 2002. Van Hollen faced no serious threat to his bid for a third term from Republican Jeffrey Stein or Green Party candidate Gerard Giblin, and he crushed both of them in the general election.

Martin Maryland    The Martin Model 167 was a U.S.-designed light bomber that first flew in 1939.  It saw action in World War II with France and the United Kingdom, where it was called the Maryland. Design and developmentIn response to a U.S. Army Air Corps light bomber requirement issued in 1938, the Glenn L. Martin Company produced their Model 167, which was given the official designation XA-22. Martin's design was a twin-engine fully metallic monoplane, capable of around 310 mph (447 km/h) and carrying a crew of three. The bombardier sat in the nose below the cockpit, and self-defense was provided by a mid-upper twin-machine gun turret, as well as four forward firing light machine guns in the wings.The XA-22 was not adopted for operational service in the U.S., as the contract was won by Douglas with its DB-7, but Martin received foreign orders, and about 450 of these relatively fast, twin-engined bombers were built. Operational history French service Facing German arms buildup and desperate for modern aircraft, the French Air Force purchased U.S. aircraft of numerous types in the late 1930s. Martin received an order for more than 200 167 Fs which incorporated French-specific equipment such as metric instruments. French officials expected the deliveries to begin in January 1939 but the type, locally designated Glenn Martin 167 A-3 only entered service in early 1940. Notably, because of the U.S. embargo on arms exports after the beginning of World War II, many aircraft were impounded for two months before being shipped to Europe. When the Germans eventually invaded France there were only four Groupes de bombardement (bomber squadrons) equipped. The Glenns were quickly sent to the front lines where they performed well with their adequate speed and excellent maneuverability for an aircraft in this class. They sometimes had a chance to avoid enemy fighters.  In more about 400 sorties versus the Germans, they suffered a loss rate of only 4%, much better than the 16% endured by LeO 451s and their crews above the same targets.Immediately before the June 1940 Armistice, units flying the Glenn Martin 167 were evacuated to French North Africa to avoid capture by the Germans. One of them landed in Spain and was interned, being tested by the Spanish Air Force.  Some examples were transferred to the Aéronautique Navale. During the Vichy rule on the French empire, French Martins occasionally clashed with British Commonwealth forces, most notably during the Syria-Lebanon campaign of 1941. As French North Africa got back in the Allied camp in 1943, M.167s were phased out of service and replaced with more modern Allied types, including Martin's B-26 Marauder.Approximately 215 Martin 167s were delivered to France. British service Just before the Franco-German Armistice, the remaining 75 planes on the French order were signed over to the United Kingdom. 32 aircraft had been completed to French specifications and were converted to British requirements in the UK; a change of engine from the Cyclone 9 to the Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp and replacement of weapons and instrumernts. The last 43 of the order were completed as required by Glenn Martin. All these aircraft received the designation Maryland Mk.I. A further 150 aircraft had been ordered directly by Britain with two-speed superchargers on their Twin Wasps and were designated Maryland Mk.II. Many of the aircraft were eventually shipped to Egypt and Malta in time for the 1941 fighting there. The RAF used the aircraft to some effect for photo-reconnaissance operations in North and Eastern Africa, sometimes as a bomber, being faster and better armed than the Blenheim, but since it was a "rare bird", its role was mainly reconnaissance missions, often flown over the most important Italian targets. A Maryland bomber was the aircraft sent to gather photographs of the Italian fleet before and after the Battle of Taranto on 11 November 1940.  The pilot of that Maryland was the famous ace Adrian Warburton, who scored his five confirmed kills with the Maryland's forward-firing guns - the only person ever to achieve ace status in a bomber type. Three Maryland Mk.I aircraft were transferred to the British Fleet Air Arm  and were mainly used for target towing duties.  On 22 May 1941, a Maryland of 771 Naval Air Squadron based at Hatston in the Orkney Islands, reported that the German battleship Bismarck had left Bergen, confirming that she was breaking-out into the Atlantic.

Maryland Route 198      Maryland Route 198 is an east–west state highway in the central part of the U.S. state of Maryland that connects Fort Meade at Maryland Route 32 to Maryland Route 28 and Maryland Route 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) near Spencerville. Route descriptionMD 198 begins at a four-way intersection between MD 650 New Hampshire Avenue and Norbeck Road (an at-grade extension of MD 28 from its eastern terminus at MD 182), several miles to the south of Ashton. Originally, Norbeck Road did not exist at this intersection, and MD 198 ended at a small three-way intersection with MD 650 several hundred yards to the north.East of here, MD 198 is a busy   suburban/rural arterial known as Spencerville Road, carrying traffic through central Montgomery County. Three miles to the east, in downtown Burtonsville, it encounters Old Columbia Pike, the original alignment of US 29, and also formerly signed as MD 196. At this intersection, MD 198 assumes the name of Old Columbia Pike. A short distance further east, the route encounters a second alignment of US 29, known as Columbia Pike, that was built in the late 1960s to carry the U.S. route around the Burtonsville Crossing Shopping Center. After the completion of roadworks on December 7, 2005, WBCM - U.S. 29 at MD 198 Relocation and Interchange Improvements  this alignment of US 29 is out of use as a through mainline route and now serves merely as a local arterial for the community; the segment north of MD 198 ends at Dustin Road, while the segment south was removed. Slightly further to the east, MD 198 encounters the current alignment of US 29 through Burtonsville. This alignment is much straighter than the previous alignment and links with MD 198 via a grade-separated 3/4 diamond interchange.Beyond the route's interchange with US 29, MD 198 widens into a four-lane non-limited access arterial and carries moderate to heavy amounts of traffic on an east–west alignment. Here, it is known as Sandy Spring Road, and passes to the north of a major industrial complex and electrical substation before meeting I-95. The two routes interchange via a large, high-speed partially unrolled cloverleaf, with the connection between MD 198 west and I-95 south being served via a semidirectional ramp. In the northeast quadrant of the interchange, Old Sandy Spring Road (a former alignment of MD 198) begins at a dead end and parallels the current routing eastward.Beyond I-95, MD 198 maintains its four-lane non-limited access cross-section as it passes a major branch office of Tower Federal Credit Union as it enters Laurel. At 9th St. in downtown Laurel, MD 198 splits into a one-way couplet; the eastbound component is known as Gorman Avenue, and the westbound component is known as Talbott Avenue. Heading east, the couplet crosses the southern terminus of MD 216 (7th St.) and US 1, itself a couplet.At US 1, the couplet collapses into a normal four-lane non-limited access carriageway as it crosses the B&O Capital Subdivision (also known as the MARC Camden Line) and Lafayette Road. Beyond the crossing, MD 198 is known as Fort Meade Road, and meets the northern terminus of MD 197 several hundred yards east of the B&O. Past MD 197, MD 198 resumes its four-lane non-limited access cross section and again serves as a major arterial, carrying heavy suburban and commuter traffic between Laurel and points east. Near the route's crossing of the Patuxent River, the route connects with Laurel Race Track Road, which serves the Laurel Park Racecourse. Continuing east, the route crosses several suburban and rural roads before meeting the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at a modified cloverleaf interchange.Beyond the B-W Parkway, MD 198 narrows to a fast two-lane highway known locally as Laurel-Fort Meade Road and continues due east, passing an old alignment of MD 216 and crossing the Little Patuxent River near a water treatment plant before veering away from its original alignment to run parallel to MD 32 for a short distance. Eventually, MD 198 reaches a dumbbell interchange with MD 32. Beyond this interchange, MD 198 becomes unsigned and winds its way to the entrance to Fort Meade, where it terminates; the roadway continues into the fort as Mapes Rd., eventually reaching MD 175. Junction list                          HistoryAfter MD 216 was severed by the Baltimore-Washington Parkway in the 1950s, MD 198 was extended east of Laurel to replace it. Before the construction of the Patuxent Freeway (Maryland Route 32) was begun between the MD 32/I-95 interchange and MD 32/B-W Parkway interchange, MD 198 was a far better route for commuters traveling from the west and south who wished to access Fort Meade, as MD 32's routing at the time (Guilford Road) was a small, two-lane country road with very low traffic-carrying capacity. The design of the I-95/MD 198 interchange, with the semidirectional connection from MD 198 west to I-95 south, further alludes to MD 198's former importance as the primary access point from points west to Fort Meade.In 1989, a new overpass to carry Route 198 over the Baltimore-Washington Parkway just east of Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring 14 motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span.  See also      References  External links  MDRoads: MD 198        
Chesapeake Ranch Estates, Maryland The Chesapeake Ranch Estates (CRE), also known locally as the Ranch Club, is located in Lusby, Maryland, in southern Calvert County. CRE was founded in 1958 as is governed by a homeowners' association, which is officially called the "Property Owner's Association of the Chesapeake Ranch Estates" (POACRE). Today, CRE is now composed of over 4,000 homes.  Amenities The CRE is close to the attractions of Solomons Island as well as in proximity to Naval Air Station Patuxent River. There are several public schools within a ten-mile radius of the community. The community maintains two private Chesapeake Bay beaches: Driftwood and Seahorse, and one manmade lake: Lake Lariat. CRE has horse stables, a small airfield, a horseshoes field, a duck pond, and a camp ground. CRE employs a small security force that works alongside the state police along with several members that live within the community itself. CRE is also home to part of the world famous Calvert Cliffs. The cliffs are made of sand and clay with clearly visible layers. Over 600 species of fossils have been identified from all of Calvert Cliffs.  The cliffs are easily accessible from Seahorse Beach but are off-limits due to the danger of collapse.CRE is a gated community manned 24/7 by guards. Today, access to the beaches and other similar amenities is still closed to non-members, however access to the roads around the community are open to all. Current issues Currently POACRE was approved by request to become a special tax district in the county, that would raise an estimated $5,750,000 needed to repair the roads.  	Lake Lariat has a history of pollution ranging from runoff, to algae blooms, and also mercury.  A ongoing effort has been made to clean the lake, and freshwater clams have been placed in the lake to help alleviate the problems. The lake also has an ongoing fish consumption advisory since 2002 by the Maryland Department of the Environment due to confirmed high levels of mercury in fish tissue in the lake, five times past the legally allowable, as all fish in Maryland have this Advisory. Recently, a growing movement has occurred to restructure POACRE or even make it a public subdivision as a solution to the growing numbers of problems that the original homeowners' association was not designed to handle when originally conceived. The Campgrounds have Been opened up to allow camping From the Public. There has been some discussions concerning the Governing Documents of the POACRE .  This matter was the subject of litigation in the case of Hanson vs Calvert County, the case is settled, Calvert County and its co defendant, Property Owners of Chesapeake Ranch Estates won the case.  It was alleged in this case that in 1989 the founders of POACRE illegally co-opted the powers of the developer (Chesapeake Ranch Club, Inc.) as Declarant of the covenants.

Maryland Day    Maryland Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. state of Maryland.  It is observed on the anniversary of the March 25, 1634, landing of the first European settlers in the Province of Maryland.  On this day settlers from The Ark and The Dove first stepped foot onto Maryland soil, at St. Clement's Island in the Potomac River. The settlers were about 150 in number, hailing from Cowes on the Isle of Wight in England.  The colony was granted to Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore two years prior by Charles I of England.  In thanksgiving for the safe landing, Jesuit Father Andrew White celebrated mass for the colonists, perhaps for the first time ever in this part of the world.  The landing coincided with the Feast of the Annunciation, a holy day honoring Mary, and the start of the new year in England's legal calendar (prior to 1752).The holiday began in 1903, the date chosen by the state board of education to honor Maryland history.  In 1916, the legislature authorized Maryland Day as a legal holiday (Chapter 633, Acts of 1916).

Suitland Manor, Maryland     Suitland Manor is a neighborhood in the unincorporated community of Suitland in Prince George's County.  It is located on the northern side of the intersection of Md. Rt 218 (Suitland Road) and Md. Rt 458 (Silver Hill Road).  Directly across Suitland Road is the Suitland Federal Center, which is home to the national headquarters of the United States Census Bureau, as well as other government agencies.  On June 29, 2006 the Redevelopment Authority of Prince George's County issued a Request for Proposals inviting developers to redevelop the property into a new residential-focused mixed-use, town center. Suitland historyThe name Suitland first appeared on the map in 1878, probably as the name of a mail distribution point at the crossroads of Silver Hill Road and Suitland Road. It later became the Village of Suitland but by the 1920s it was still rural. The 1940s brought a surge of development with the demand for housing after World War II; the establishment of Andrews Air Force Base on the eastern periphery of the neighborhood; the building of the Suitland Parkway linking Washington D.C.; and the opening of the Census Bureau and the Naval Intelligence Support Center on the site now known as the Suitland Federal Center. Throughout the 1960s extensive apartment construction was introduced to Suitland. By 1970, multi-family units accounted for 80% of the total units. Signs of neighborhood deterioration began to appear at this time. There were several areas that became plagued by numerous social problems: high crime rates, drugs, property-standard violations, absentee landlords, and ultimately disinvestment in the community.In the 1990s, extensive neighborhood revitalization efforts began in the Suitland focus area to identify and prioritize local needs and develop a plan to address those needs. The plan included a broad vision and specific community recommendations, including the creation of a town center at the crossroads of Silver Hill Road and Suitland Road to revitalize the business district and the deteriorated Suitland Manor apartment complex. Suitland Manor siteThe Suitland Manor project site is located at the northwest quadrant of the intersection of Suitland Road and Silver Hill Road across from the Suitland Federal Center and within walking distance to the Suitland Metro Station. The existing 33 acre (130,000 m²) project area consists of marginal commercial businesses and deteriorating multi-family structures of varying densities. The existing housing included 167 four-unit buildings and 19 townhouses. There are nine commercial properties with frontage along Silver Hill Road, and three with frontage along Suitland Road. The adjacent residential neighborhood consists of established single-family homes, more recent townhouse developments, and apartments. A new elementary school has been built adjacent to the project site. The Redevelopment Authority of Prince George’s County is in the process of acquiring all the residential units to facilitate land assemblage for redevelopment of the site.For decades Suitland Manor has been plagued with debilitating illegal drug transactions and the ancillary crimes that result from drug dealing. Poor management controls created because of the high number of absentee landlords owning individual buildings has compromised the community environment. These ownership patterns that have evolved over the years have stymied comprehensive improvement efforts in this distressed multi-family community.The development goal is to assemble the individual properties in Suitland Manor under one owner in order to start the revitalization process. The Redevelopment Authority (RA) is acquiring the entire residential portion of Suitland Manor for redevelopment. RA will be responsible for acquisition, tenant relocation, and demolition to prepare the property for development.The new development will stress new homeownership opportunities with a diversity of housing types, layouts, building forms, and sizes. Housing opportunities will be available for a variety of lifestyles and income levels - from young professionals to seniors. Innovative architecture will create a distinctive development that will dramatically change the image of Suitland and bring a contemporary and competitive presence to the neighborhood. Sustaining Suitland during redevelopmentThe redevelopment process for Suitland includes acquisition, relocation, and demolition. The project is subject to the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). URA governs the rights of property owners and tenants throughout this process. To date, 159 families have been relocated from units owned by RA. Twenty of these families have purchased homes utilizing the URA benefits provided by RA.The Redevelopment Authority works with Suitland community leaders and other county agencies to control trash and illegal dumping that are attracted to the area. An on-site property manager handles all issues associated with vacant properties and tenants waiting to be relocated.To reduce crime in Suitland Manor, RA is working with the Prince George's County Police Department and the Office of the State’s Attorney through their Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Nuisance Abatement Program to eliminate illegal drug activity in the Suitland Manor apartments. RA is also offering an additional $1,000 reward to anyone providing information for the arrest and conviction of an individual committing an illegal act in Suitland Manor.Two buildings with 8 apartments have been held back from demolition to accommodate the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, and the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity - organizations offering mentoring and educational outreach programs to the youth in the community. In addition, the Youth 2002 entrepreneurial program is providing business skill training from one of these building to engage youth with entrepreneurial interests.These services are intended ultimately to promote self-sufficiency, provide learning opportunities for children, and play a part in RA’s mission of community building. The community services provided will evolve as conditions and needs arise during the development process in Suitland and will be part of the new community that is built. Whether they are recreational programs, educational offerings, meeting spaces, or family support services, these opportunities are a catalyst to improve the individual, the family, the neighborhood, and the larger community, and are part of creating the new Suitland.In late August 2005, Suitland Elementary School opened at the top of the block on Homer Avenue. Suitland community redevelopment goalsThe Suitland Manor initiative is designed to create a new Suitland neighborhood through a comprehensive redevelopment strategy. The goal is to create a unique image for Suitland that will help forge a sense of community and create a cohesive new neighborhood. It will also include a mix of uses offering commercial and community services with the residential development. This helps to attract people to live, work and play in the same area. Diversity through mixed-use usually translates into density and vibrancy. They are also safe communities that are physically designed to deter crime and ensure a safe living environment. Suitland Manor, along with the other properties sitting within the redevelopment site, is zoned M-U-TC (Mixed-Use Town Center). This zone was created to encourage the establishment of higher density and mixed-uses that foster an environment supportive to a diverse range of residential units, commercial activities, and income groups.

William Stone (Maryland governor)    William Stone, 3rd Proprietary Governor of Maryland (c. 1603 – c. 1660) was an English pioneer and an early settler in Maryland. He was governor of the colony of Maryland from 1649 to 1655. Early lifeStone was born in Northamptonshire, England. Concise Dictionary of American Biography, p. 1018. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons/London: Oxford University Press, 1964. On 15 Sept 1619 William Stone set sail for Virginia on the Margaret of Bristol, and was one of the people being sent to Berkeley Hundred to work under Captain John Woodlief's supervision. William was supposed to serve the Society of Berkeley Hundred's investors for six years in exchange for 30 acres of land.  Sometime prior to 9 February 1629, he received a tobacco bill from Richard Wheeler. By 4 June 1635, William had patented 1,800 acres in Accomack. Local court records reveal that he was the brother to Andrew Stone and Captain John Stone, who had been trading on the Eastern Shore since 1626. By 1634 William Stone had become a commissioner of the county court. Some time prior to February 1636, he married Verlinda, the daughter of Captain Thomas Graves. William went on to become sheriff and vestryman. In 1645 he was residing on the Eastern Shore, in what had become Northampton County. By 1648 he had become the third proprietary governor of Maryland.  Stone came to America in 1628 with a group of Puritans who settled in the Eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. Their settlement thrived, but eventually came into conflict with Virginia's established Episcopal Church.In 1648, Stone reached an agreement with Cecilius Calvert, the 2nd Lord Baltimore to resettle the group in central Maryland. Governor of the Maryland colonyOn August 8, 1648, Lord Baltimore named Stone the Governor of his colony. He was the first Protestant Governor. The Assembly sought a confirmation of their religious liberty and in 1649 Governor Stone signed the Religious Toleration Act, which permitted liberty to all Christian denominations.In 1649, Stone and Puritan exiles from Virginia founded the town of Providence on the north shore of the Severn River and across from what is today the Maryland state capital of Annapolis.In 1654, after the Third English Civil War (1649–51), Parliamentary forces assumed control of Maryland and Stone went into exile in Virginia.  Per orders from Lord Baltimore, Stone returned the following spring at the head of a Cavalier force.  But, in what is known as the Battle of the Severn (March 25, 1655), Stone was defeated and taken prisoner. Stone was replaced as Governor by Josias Fendall (1628–87), and took no further part in public affairs.William Stone wrote his will on 3 Dec 1659, and it was proved in Charles Co. Maryland on 21 Dec 1660.  Verlinda Graves Stone wrote her will on 3 March 1674-5, and the will was proved on 13 July 1675 in Charles Co., MD.  Restoration and land grantIn 1660, the monarchy in England and the proprietor's government in Maryland were restored. Lord Baltimore granted Stone as much land as he could ride around in a day, as a reward for Stone's faithful service.  Stone concentrated on developing his plantation at Poynton Manor in what is now Charles County, Maryland, where he died in about 1660.  LegacyStone's great-grandson, David (born 1709), greatly expanded the value of the estate at Poynton and returned the family to prominence.  William Stone's great-great-grandsons made major contributions to the foundation of Maryland as an American state: Thomas Stone signed the Declaration of Independence, Michael Jenifer Stone represented Maryland in the First United States Congress, John Hoskins Stone was Governor of Maryland 1794–97, and William Murray Stone was the Episcopal Bishop of Baltimore.

Strathmore (Maryland)     Strathmore is a cultural and artistic venue and institution in North Bethesda, Maryland, USA.  Strathmore was founded in 1981 and consists of two venues: the Mansion and the Music Center.The Strathmore arts complex is connected to an upper floor of the parking garage at the Grosvenor-Strathmore Washington Metro station via an elevated pedestrian walkway, the Carlton R. Sickles Memorial Sky Bridge, named after late Congressman Carlton R. Sickles. The complex is thus accessible for patrons coming from Washington, D.C., as well as the northern part of Montgomery County, Maryland via the Metro rail system. BackgroundThe center's President & CEO is Eliot Pfanstiehl. More than 5,000 artists and 2 million visitors have attended exhibitions, concerts, teas, educational events and outdoor festivals since 1983. Highlights include hosting the first National Kaleidoscope Exhibition, the world premiere of the Rhodes-Nadler Art Collection, the opening of the 1,976-seat Music Center at Strathmore in February 2005, described as “…the best place to hear an orchestra the Washington area has ever known”;  and producing the world premiere concert of "cELLAbration: A Tribute to Ella Jenkins". Performance and other facilities  The Mansion at Strathmore is situated on   which surround the colonial revival mansion built in 1899 for the Oyster family, and sold to Charles Corby in 1908.   The Mansion houses small concerts, art exhibitions, the Strathmore Tea Room, and the Shop at Strathmore.  This is the original Strathmore venue and it remained so for almost 25 years.  The Mansion features a 100-seat Dorothy M. and Maurice C. Shapiro Music room.  This room hosts the Music in the Mansion series with performances of chamber music, vocal and instrumental recitals, jazz and folk music.  There is an 1850 Broadwood piano, restored in 1994.  There are free outdoor concerts in summer, as well as hee Backyard Theater for Children every Thursday morning.The art of Strathmore brings in thousands of visitors each year. There are more than two dozen exhibitions each season from local artists and from collaborations with renowned museums, such as the Baltimore Museum.  The Gudelsky Gallery Suite, located at the top of the grand staircase, was named after philanthropists, Homer and Martha Gudelsky.  Supported by a donation from the Gudelsky Family Foundation, this gallery features four galleries.  It is the only venue of its kind in Montgomery County.   There is also a Sculpture Garden that winds through the complex's  .  The Neo-Georgian mansion has columned porticos, Palladian windows and a hilltop setting, the Neo-Georgian mansion is an elegant reflection of the past.  Strathmore was designed by Appleton P. Clark, Jr., and constructed in 1902 as a summer home for Captain and Mrs. James Oyster and their family.  Beginning in 1908, the Oysters sold the residence and its   to Charles I. Corby and his wife, Hattie.  It was used as a summer home until 1914 when it was remodeled by architect Charles Keene.  After the modifications, the residence became the permanent abode for the Corby family.  Mr. Corby died in 1926 after acquiring nearly   of surrounding land and maintaining a fully operational dairy farm and a private golf course.  With the death of Mrs. Corby in 1941, the home was purchased by the Sisters of the Holy Cross in 1943 and became known as St. Angela Hall, serving as a convent and school for many years.  A local legend  persists that from 1941 to 1944, the mansion served as a residence and a temporary governmental headquarters for Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.  However, there is no firm evidence to support this assertion.  In 1977, the Sisters of the Holy Cross sold the mansion to the American Speech and Hearing Association (ASHA) as a temporary headquarters.  In 1979, Montgomery County purchased the property from ASHA for use as an Arts Center.  On June 21, 1983, after major restoration of the facility, Strathmore opened its doors to the public.    The Music Center at Strathmore, which seats 1,976, is a concert hall and education center which opened in February 2005. It was funded by a combination of State of Maryland, Montgomery County and private corporate and local resources to provide a modern concert venue for a wide variety of musical events.  Anchored by the founding partners, Strathmore and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, resident artistic partners include the National Philharmonic, Washington Performing Arts Society, CityDance Ensemble, Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras, and Levine School of Music. The venue presents over 150 performances a year and over 75 arts and music education classes each week. Designed by William Rawn Associates Architects, Inc. of Boston along with Grimm & Parker Architects   of Bethesda, MD, acousticians Kirkegaard Associates of Chicago, and Theatre Projects Consultants of South Norwalk, Connecticut, the result is a critically acclaimed venue that Tim Smith from The Baltimore Sun proclaims a, “first class space for music-making.”  Design & AcousticsThe Music Center at Strathmore features an undulating roof that outlines the sloping form of the concert hall. Inspired by the rolling hills of the Strathmore grounds, the   building is nestled into the an   park-like setting. The German limestone façade is punctuated by large glass walls. A six-story,   high glass wall in the Lockheed Martin Lobby features 402 panes of glass, and opens to the outdoor Trawick Terrace that overlooks the Strathmore campus. The concert hall was designed in the traditional “shoebox” form of many international concert halls.Above the stage, a mechanized canopy of 43 individually controlled acrylic panels can be adjusted to fine-tune sound for clarity and reverberation. Tunable sound-absorbing curtains behind the bronze grilling and banners in the ceiling can be deployed out of sight to dampen or enliven the sound. These acoustical adjustments enable sound technicians to accommodate a wide range of programming—from a solo recital to full symphony orchestra to amplified performances. The interior finishes of the Concert Hall include   of maple wood floors, and   of white birch wall paneling, with red birch details. Custom design details include 700 bronze mesh wall panels, 250 alabaster art glass light fixtures, and maple wood and aubergine velour seats. The Education Center, located at the opposite end of the building, features four expansive rehearsal spaces, including a dance studio with a sprung floor and two rehearsal rooms with   high ceilings. This wing of the building also features a children’s music classroom, a small two-story rehearsal room and nine solo and small group practice spaces. History Strathmore, which began as a turn-of-the-century mansion featuring small chamber performances and art exhibitions in 1983, developed its plans for the Music Center over 20 years ago.  In 1985, Strathmore’s Board of Directors and President and CEO Eliot Pfanstiehl began discussions about the need for a larger educational and performance space. Approximately 11 years later,  in 1996, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, under the leadership of former president John Gidwitz, expressed interest in creating a second home in Montgomery County, and joined Strathmore as a founding partner in a dream for the Music Center at Strathmore. The Music Center at Strathmore plan was led by Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan and Maryland Governor Parris N. Glendening. The vision became a reality when, in 1998, the Montgomery County Council and the Maryland State Legislature approved matching capital support ($48 million each) for the Music Center at Strathmore. After the design team was selected in 2001, work began under the direction of the county. The public-private partnership between Strathmore Hall Foundation, Inc. assumes the day-to-day management and artistic programming of the Music Center and Mansion. Hundreds of generous  donors stepped forward to help build, equip and sustain the operation of the Music Center.  Gudelsky Concert Pavilion and Gazebo, for outdoor performances.    Outdoor Sculpture Garden. The grounds contain 23 commissioned and donated sculptures by various local and national artists, including works by Stefan Saal, Barton Rubenstein, Carol Gellner Levin, Foon Sham and Wendy Ross. New SculpturesLocated on the Bou Family Terrace, "Tetra Con Brio," a monumental sculpture of cast bronze, steel, and polished concrete, stands   tall and weighs 4,500 pounds. Created by California artist Roger W. Stoller, the commissioned work was underwritten by Kenneth and Phillip O’Brien in memory of their father, Ben O’Brien, founder of  Music & Arts Centers. Suspended above a three-level staircase and spanning   of open vertical space by the Discovery Channel foyer, New York artist Meryl Taradash’s "The Music of Light" is composed of shaped acrylic prisms, curved polished aluminum arcs, and reflected light.

Republic of Maryland  The Republic of Maryland (also known as the Independent State of Maryland) was a small African American nation which existed from 1854 to 1857, when it was merged into what is now Liberia. The area was first settled in 1834 by freed African-American slaves and freeborn African-Americans primarily from the U.S. state of Maryland, under the auspices of the Maryland State Colonization Society. The African Repository, Volume 14, p.42. Retrieved March 13, 2010   In 1838, other African-American settlements were united into the Commonwealth of Liberia, which declared its independence in 1847. The Maryland colony remained apart, as the state colonization society wished to maintain its trade monopoly in the area. On 2 February 1841, Maryland-in-Africa became the State of Maryland. Following a referendum in 1853, the state declared its independence on 29 May 1854 as Maryland in Liberia, Constitution and Laws of Maryland in Liberia, p.1 Retrieved March 13, 2010  with its capital at Harper. HistoryIn  December 1831, the Maryland state legislature appropriated US$10,000 for 26 years to transport free blacks and ex-slaves from the United States to Africa, and the Maryland State Colonization Society was established for this purpose.  Settlement of Cape Palmas  Originally a branch of the American Colonization Society that had founded Liberia in 1822, the Maryland State Colonization Society decided to establish a new settlement of its own that could accommodate its emigrants.  The first area to be settled was Cape Palmas, in 1834, somewhat south of the rest of Liberia.  The Cape is a small, rocky peninsula connected to the mainland by a sandy isthmus. Immediately to the west of the peninsula is the estuary of the Hoffman River. Approximately 21 km (15 mi) further along the coast to the east, the Cavalla River empties into the sea, marking the border between Liberia and the Ivory Coast. It marks the western limit of the Gulf of Guinea, according to the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO).Most of the settlers were freed African-American slaves and freeborn African-Americans primarily from the state of Maryland.  The colony was named Maryland In Africa (also known as Maryland in Liberia) on February 12, 1834. John Brown RusswurmIn 1836 the colony appointed its first black governor John Brown Russwurm (1799–1851), who remained governor until his death. Russwurm encouraged the immigration of African-Americans to Maryland and supported agriculture and trade.    He had begun his career as the colonial secretary for the American Colonization Society between 1830 and 1834.  He also worked as the editor of the Liberia Herald, though he resigned his post in 1835 to protest America's colonization policies.In 1838, a number of other American settlements on the west coast of Africa united to form the Commonwealth of Liberia, which then declared its independence in 1847. However, the colony of Maryland in Liberia remained independent, as the Maryland State Colonization Society wished to maintain its trade monopoly in the area. On 2 February 1841, Maryland-in-Africa was granted  statehood and became the State of Maryland. In 1847 the Maryland State Colonization Society published the Constitution and Laws of Maryland in Liberia, based on the United States Constitution. Declaration of Independence, and annexation by LiberiaOn 29 May 1854, the State of Maryland declared its independence, naming itself Maryland in Liberia,  with its capital at Harper. It was also known as the Republic of Maryland. It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro Rivers. However, it would survive just three years as an independent state.Soon afterwards, local tribes including the Grebo and the Kru attacked the State of Maryland in retaliation for its disruption of the slave trade.  Unable to maintain its own defence, Maryland appealed to Liberia, its more powerful neighbor, for help. President Roberts sent military assistance, and an alliance of Marylanders and Liberian militia troops successfully repelled the local tribesmen. However, it was now clear that the Republic of Maryland could not survive as an independent state, and following a referendum, Maryland was annexed by Liberia on 6 April 1857, becoming known henceforth as Maryland County.

Maryland Republican Party  The Maryland Republican Party is the branch of the United States Republican Party (GOP) located in the state of Maryland, headquartered in Annapolis.  It is historically the underdog party in Maryland state politics.   Current elected officials  Members of Congress  U.S. House of Representatives  Andrew P. Harris, 1st District   Statewide offices  None   State Legislature  Senate Minority Leader: E.J. Pipkin House Minority Leader: Anthony O'Donnell   County governmentAs of 2011 the Maryland GOP is the majority party of county governments. It holds 15 of 23 counties excluding Baltimore City. It controls 9 out of the 15 Majority Control counties including all of Western Maryland for the first time. State governmentIt doesn't control executive offices.In the House of Delegates it gained six seats in the 2010 election. In the state Senate it lost two seats in 2010 including the seat that was held by the GOP Chairman Alex Mooney. State PartyThe Republican Party is the minority party in both houses of the Maryland General Assembly. In the House of Delegates, the Republicans control 43 seats to the Democrats' 98. In the Maryland State Senate, the Republicans control 12 seats to the Democrats' 35. Because of this more than two-to-one government majority, predominantly Republican areas of Maryland, such as the Eastern Shore, become worried that their representatives' voices are not being heard.The Republican Party enjoys widespread support from Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, both of which are mainly rural. In other areas of the state such as heavily populated Montgomery County, Prince George's County, and the City of Baltimore, Republicans are a minority.The state of Maryland is mainly democratic because of its vast urban areas and cities such as Baltimore. In comparison to the national Republican Party, the Maryland Republican Party is trending more conservative. This is especially true concerning social issues and immigration. For example, Republican Congressman Wayne Gilchrest pro-choice on the abortion issue was defeated by pro-life state senator Andy Harris in the Republican primary in 2008.In 2003, Michael Steele became the first African-American elected to statewide office in the state of Maryland, when he was elected Lieutenant Governor. Prior to this, Steele served as the Chairman of the Maryland Republican Party. In 2009, Michael S. Steele was elected chair of the Republican National Committee, the first African-American to hold that position.Important historical members of the Maryland Republican Party have included former Governor  and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, the second vice president ever to resign the office, and former Senator Charles Mathias. Current eventsThe Washington Post characterized the party as "close to broke" as of January 2009, with $703.10 on hand and $57,000 in loans and bills. The Maryland Election Board also ruled in 2009 that the Maryland GOP must return $77,500 to a campaign account of Steele for party legal expenses that he had paid.   As of November 2011 the Baltimore Sun reports that the Maryland Republican party now owes over $100,000 to vendors that stems from the 2010 election cycle.  Current notable Maryland RepublicansRobert L. Ehrlich, Jr. was the only Republican governor of Maryland since the 1960s who served as governor from 2003 to 2007. He was defeated by a landslide in the 2010 election against current Democratic governor Martin O'Malley. Ehrlich's wife, Kendel Ehrlich, is a notable state Republican who hosts, along with her husband, a conservative talk radio show on WBAL 1090-AM in Baltimore. Andy Harris was one of the few bright spots for Maryland Republicans in the 2010 election as he won a congressional seat back from the Democrats.Alex Mooney lost his Senate seat in 2010 but is the new chairman of the state Republican Party.Anthony J. O'Donnell currently represents District 29 in the Maryland House of Delegates. He has held that spot since being elected in January 1995. Audrey Scott is the controversial outgoing chairwoman of the Maryland Republican Party but is partially credited with helping to get Maryland's fiscal state back on track.

Maryland State Board of Censors   The Maryland State Board of Censors was a three-member state agency created in 1916 required to view all films to be shown in the state, and decide whether or not the films were "moral and proper." "State history of Maryland State Board of Censors." Maryland State Archives. Retrieved on March 23, 2009.  Without approval of the agency, a film could not be legally shown in Maryland.  The agency was also charged with enforcing their decisions.One agency decision against a film led to the Supreme Court case Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51 (1965), which placed significant restrictions on state censorship statutes.

Maryland Defense Force  The Maryland Defense Force is the state defense force for the state of Maryland, United States. Its main mission is to provide financial, medical, legal, and logistical support for the Maryland Army National Guard and the Maryland Air National Guard. The Maryland Defense Force falls under the command of the Governor of Maryland and the Adjutant General. It is a component of the Maryland Military Department. Its history dates back to colonial days in the 17th century, but it was formally established in 1917 with the mission "to protect public buildings, water supplies, and other properties". It was called the Maryland State Guard. It was disbanded in 1920 to make room for the National Guard to return to duties in the armories. The Maryland State Guard was reactivated in 1939 in response to World War II. It was then deactivated in 1947.As of 1983, the Maryland State Guard was reactivated and renamed the Maryland Defense Force. In 1994, the Maryland Defense Force's missions were expanded to search and rescue, armory staffing, and disaster relief. As of Sept 11, 2001, the Maryland Defense Force was tasked with its current mission - to provide support to the Maryland Military Department as needed. HistoryMarylanders have a proud heritage of defending and serving their communities in times of war and disaster. From the volunteer colonial militias of the 17th century, to the citizen soldiers that responded to America's great conflicts that have touched the state, Maryland has come together to protect our shores and borders in times of distress and disaster. That inherited spirit of service gave birth to The Maryland State Guard during the past two world wars and is the origin of the Maryland Defense Force. World War I On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war on Imperial Germany and her allies and entered the Great War raging on the European Continent. Due to legislation beginning in 1903, aimed at standardizing the various state militias and creating a viable National Guard, President Wilson called upon the National Guard units of Maryland for service overseas in Europe. Federal mobilization was not new to the Maryland Guard who had just returned from a 1916 tour of duty on the Mexican border. When the National Guard of Maryland was inducted en masse on July 25, 1917, into the Army of the United States, the people of Maryland and the Governor lost control of the only organized and trained defensive body at its disposal and was left naked to acts of aggression, unrest, and disaster.Responding to fill the void in the state's defenses, Maryland State Governor Emerson C. Harrington called for the General Assembly on May 25, 1917 to pass a law for the "organization and maintenance" of a State Guard to protect "public buildings, water supplies and other properties, and . . . public service and industrial plants." The "State Guard Bill" (S.B.12) was passed unanimously in an unprecedented 10 days, and legally authorized the governor to: "recruit (through volunteering or draft), equip, train and otherwise maintain a body of armed troops within this State, to be known as the Maryland State Guard and, empowered the Governor to call the State Guard into active State service when the public interest and safety require." On October 23, 1917, Maryland State Adjutant General Henry M. Warfield appointed one of his predecessors, Major General Clinton L. Riggs, as colonel of the newly designated Maryland State Guard and organization and recruitment was done in earnest.Nine companies totaling 34 officers and 518 men turned out twice-weekly to drill and train. Many who volunteered were veterans of the Spanish-American War and the newly formed guard benefited greatly from their previous training and steady bearing, setting a precedent for the recruitment of former military personnel that continues today. The state guardsmen did turn out twice, fulfilling their role during their time of service, to keep the peace during controversial criminal trials in Annapolis and Easton in 1919.As quickly as the State Guard came, it went, officially disbanding on March 1, 1920, making way for the Maryland National Guard to return to their armories. The 1919 Adjutant General report to the Governor assessed the performance of the Maryland State Guard during the war as follows:   World War II Nineteen years later, the start of World War II opened the second chapter in the history of the Maryland State Guard. In response to the growing threat and possibility of U.S. involvement in combat operations, Congress once again inducted the National Guard troops of the 48 states into Federal service during September 1940.Once again the need arose for an active, trained, and properly equipped force capable of patrolling and providing a competent response to emergencies in the absence of the National Guard. This assessment paved the way for Congress to make an important change to the National Defense Act of 1916, allowing states to form and deploy "such military forces other than the National Guard as may be provided by the laws of such State . . . while any part of the National Guard of the State concerned is in active Federal service." This change was important in the role and formation of state defense forces nationwide, because it allowed the various state governments to return to the organization of regulated militia forces even in peacetime for the internal well-being of the state. The new legislation also authorized Federal training assistance and to provide "to any State upon requisition of the Governor thereof, such arms and equipment as can be spared by the War Department." The law also clarified that these forces could not be called out of their home state by the Federal government for any reason, but eligible individual members would not be exempt from the draft.The nationwide response to this legislation peaked in June 1943 with 170,403 members enrolled in 37 states that had activated state defense forces. Maryland responded with the unanimous passage of the State Guard Act on February 14, 1941. The act expanded and defined the role of the State Guard with greater authority and responsibility in case of activation and detailed a mission of service "in case of insurrection, invasion, tumult, riot, breach of peace or imminent danger thereof, or to enforce the laws of this state with all the authority of sheriffs and deputy sheriffs." Following the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Governor O'Conor ordered the entire Maryland State Guard to active duty status. With the close proximity to Washington DC, the guardsmen were acutely aware of their responsibilities. A Federal bulletin was issued warning of a possible Axis powers attack on one or more American seaports set for Christmas Eve 1941. The State Guard was detailed to look after "Air bases, air fields, golf courses, and level open spaces which offer opportunities for potential landing fields, or for landing parachute troops." By 1942, army intelligence reassessed an invasion threat as "highly improbable", but emergency reaction and point security or force protection of sensitive and potentially sensitive installations remained a priority in light of landings of German agents from submarines on the East Coast during 1942-1944.Because the civilian workers that made up the State Guard could not be placed on patrol duty for the duration of the war, a Special Military Police unit was established on January 9, 1942 and consisted of 324 officers and men.In 1942, under the command of Brigadier General Dwight H. Mohr, the state guard consisted of a brigade headquarters company, with radio section and chemical warfare section, eight infantry battalions, one engineer battalion, one medical battalion, one special military police unit and an African-American battalion commanded by Major William Creigler. Muster roles place membership at a high of 2,731 officers and enlisted men enrolled on the muster books for 1944.Along with the constant patrol activities of the Special Military Police unit, the Maryland State Guard was called out on 11 separate occasions around the state from Elkton to Cumberland from Oct 2, 1941, to August 15, 1945. Missions included critical facilities patrols, disaster relief following a flood and tornado, security following two explosions, a large train wreck, and firefighter assistance totaling 129 days on active duty. State guardsmen were, and are, compensated with pay as their National Guard counterparts when on active duty.By 1947, the last Maryland State Guard formation of World War II was disbanded and once again the role of state defense was returned to the National Guard. During the Cold War a variety of Federal and state legislative efforts tried to grapple with the need for additional state troops and to define their role and purpose. At the same time, the standing army, reserve, and National Guard were undergoing organizational changes that would establish a clear need for states to have authority to raise and maintain additional forces. Expanded Role of the National Guard The "Total Force" doctrine adopted by the army in 1970 clearly expanded the role that National Guard troops would play in future army deployment plans. If rapid expansion and deployment of force was necessary, reserve and National Guard units would be called upon first, before the army turned to a draft to supplement its strength. National Guard units were called upon to change their mission to adopt key logistical and security support roles such as vehicle maintenance and military police functions. This plan was clearly demonstrated in the rapid activation of many National Guard support units in the First Gulf War and worked well.The states that contributed these units clearly recognized that a rapid call up of their National Guard forces left a defense deficit at home, a void that needed to be supplemented. Considering the implications for the safety of the state during the spring legislative session of 1983, Maryland took advantage of Federal changes made in 1958 to the language of the National Defense Act of 1916, allowing states to voluntarily maintain forces of their own in times of peace, and passed a reactivation of the state code reestablishing the Maryland Defense Force on July 1, 1983.By 1995, twenty-five states revitalized and organized their state defense units to fill the state defense void. As these various organizations were reestablished, the states' interpretation of their roles and missions varied. In 1994, the Maryland Defense Force was tasked with armory staffing, possible suppression of terrorism, search and rescue, and disaster relief along with community support and youth outreach. Post September 11, 2001 The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the subsequent War on Terrorism crystallized a need for layered state defenses and support organizations. With Reserve and National Guard operational activities at a high not seen since World War II, the Maryland Defense Force has been tasked with a new mission:   External links  Official website Maryland Military Historical Society   
Maryland Midland Railway   The Maryland Midland Railway   is a Class III short-line railroad operating about 63 miles of track in central Maryland.   It was originally headquartered in the former Western Maryland Railway station in Union Bridge, Maryland, however it is now located in a new facility across the street from the old station.   The railroad has been 87.4% owned by Genesee & Wyoming Inc since 2008, with Lehigh Cement (the largest shipper on the line) retaining a 12.6% interest.The railway currently operates on track from Highfield, Maryland (west) to Glyndon, Maryland (east), via a short two mile loop through Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and from Woodsboro, Maryland (south) to Taneytown, Maryland (north).  HistoryOperations began in 1980 over a section of ex-Pennsylvania Railroad line from Taneytown to Walkersville, Maryland. Starting in 1983 the ex-Western Maryland Railway line from Emory Grove to Highfield was purchased from CSXT in sections.The railroad's business grew from trains pulling 200 freight cars per year in the 1980s to 18,000 freight cars in 2006.  By 2006, it owned a fleet of ten locomotives; three GP9 low hoods, and seven GP38-3, all of EMD build. Its rolling stock also included 410 freight cars owned and/or leased.In 2008, the railroad was purchased by Genesee & Wyoming, a US-based corporation that owns multiple railroad shortlines in the United States and Australia.   Passenger excursion line From 1990 to 1995, the EnterTRAINment Line provided passenger excursions on the Maryland Midland Railway system. This service was discontinued when EnterTRAINment went out of business in May 1995.    More recently, Maryland Midland has been a freight-only line, except for occasional trips by stockholders and the Western Maryland Railway Historical Society Museum, located in an adjoining building in Union Bridge.

Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras    The Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras (MCYO), is a youth orchestra program in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.  Along with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the National Philharmonic, MCYO is affiliated with the Strathmore music center.  MCYO's programs include a harp ensemble, several chamber ensembles, three string orchestras and three full orchestras.   In total, MCYO consists of over 450 young musicians in grades 3 though 12.   MCYO was the impetus for starting the Gifted and Talented program run by the Maryland State Department of Education.The current artistic advisor for MCYO is Jonathan Carney, the concertmaster of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.  HistoryMCYO has been at the forefront of music education in Maryland for all of its long and eventful history. Founded in 1946, MCYO has continued a vibrant orchestral program for talented youth. The mission of the Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras is to nurture and develop and advance talented young musicians and enrich the community with a quality orchestral experience. The MCYO program creates a seamless connection between the artistic and the educational experience. MCYO now enjoys its first permanent home in the grand Music Center at Strathmore.Over the years, MCYO has added several ensembles to expand its outreach to talented youth. With the help and support of public school music teachers, private school music teachers, and private studio music teachers, the caliber and number of musicians has increased dramatically. Currently there are over 400 young musicians involved in MCYO selected from over 1200 aspiring musicians.Many honors have been bestowed upon MCYO. In 1964 in Philadelphia, the Philharmonic performed at the Music Educators National Conference (MENC) Bicentennial Conference. Its summer music camp at Deep Creek Lake in 1965 formed the basis of the Maryland Center for the Arts with instruction broadened to include dance, drama, and visual arts. The Maryland Center for the Arts is now operated by the State of Maryland at Goucher College in Towson and Salisbury State in Salisbury, Maryland. In 1969 the Philharmonic was the first American orchestra to perform at the International Festival of Youth in Switzerland. In 1971 MCYO traveled to Europe, performing in Salzburg, Dubrovnik and Zagreb. In 1977 MCYO performed at the first American Festival of Youth Orchestras. In 1981, the Philharmonic was the first youth orchestra to be showcased at the Kennedy Center. Dongu, Robert. "Next up for state's youth orchestra: Vienna and Prague", The Gazette, Maryland,  June 24, 2009. Retrieved on 2010-06-14.  Hundreds of thousands of listeners heard the Philharmonic on the WMAL  Christmas Eve day concert, “Live from the Kennedy Center,” live and on the radio. This was a longstanding tradition through 2003. In 1987 the Symphony was selected to perform at the MENC Eastern Division Conference in Baltimore. In 1995 the Philharmonic and Symphony toured England and Wales as MCYO began its 50th season. The 50th Anniversary Concert premiered Andreas Makris’ "Antithesis." Later that year, the Philharmonic was invited to and performed at the prestigious Mid-West International Band and Orchestra Clinic in Chicago. Two years later, the Philharmonic again performed at the MENC Eastern Division Conference in Baltimore at which it gave the World Premiere of "Echoes of a Forgotten Dream", a composition commissioned by Joseph J. McIntrye. In 1999 the Philharmonic traveled to Austria, touring four cities as part of the Johann Strauss Centennial Celebration. In 2000 the Philharmonic was one of twenty music ensembles from across the USA selected from over two hundred applicants to perform at the MENC National Conference in Washington, DC, at which it gave the World Premiere of "Echoes of a Forgotten Dream", a composition commissioned by Joseph J. McIntrye. In June 2002 the Philharmonic made its Carnegie Hall debut in New York City. Also, in 2002, MCYO changed its name from Montgomery County Youth Orchestras to Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras, keeping the acronym MCYO. In 2005 MCYO became a resident partner at The Music Center at Strathmore. Travel abroad returned in June 2009 when the Philharmonic performed in Austria and the Czech Republic. In December 2010 they performed for the 25gh Silver Anniversary of the London New Year's Celebration and Parade in Great Britain. In May 2011 the Chamber Strings and Chamber Orchestra made their debut at Carnegie Hall.Philharmonic members annually perform with the National Symphony on the NSO Youth Orchestra Day. Select MCYO musicians participate in the NSO Fellowship program, and participate in master classes with renowned soloists and teachers. From 1993 various MCYO musicians have performed with the National Symphony Summer Music Institute. Since 1997, select MCYO musicians have augmented the National Festival Orchestra in New York City, performing with college, conservatory and select high school musicians from across the US and Canada in Carnegie Hall. In the fall of 2006, MCYO and the Baltimore Symphony began a collaboration whereby BSO musicians present Master Class experiences and coaching services to MCYO musicians.Over the years, many MCYO alumni have continued their music education in such leading institutions as The Juilliard School, the Curtis Institute of Music, the Eastman School of Music, Oberlin Conservatory, the New England Conservatory, Peabody Institute, Indiana University, Northwestern University, and the Hartt School of Music.

1987 Maryland train collision    The Chase, Maryland train collision occurred at 1:04 pm on January 4, 1987, on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor main line in the Chase community in eastern Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, at Gunpow Interlocking, about   northeast of Baltimore. Amtrak train 94, the Colonial (now part of the Northeast Regional, from Washington, D.C., to Boston), crashed into a set of Conrail locomotives running light, and which had fouled the mainline. Train 94's speed at the time of the collision was estimated at about  . Fourteen passengers on the Amtrak train were killed, as well as the Amtrak engineer and lounge car attendant.The Conrail locomotive crew failed to slow down at the signals before Gunpow Interlocking, and it was determined that the accident would have been avoided had they done so.  Additionally, they tested positive for marijuana.  The engineer served four years in a Maryland prison for his role in the crash. In the aftermath, drug and alcohol procedures for train crews were overhauled by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which is charged with rail safety. In 1991, prompted in large part by the Chase Maryland crash, the United States Congress took even broader action and authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in "safety-sensitive" jobs in all industries regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) including trucking, bus carriers and rail systems. Additionally, all trains operating on the high-speed Northeast Corridor are now equipped with automatic cab signalling with an automatic train stop feature.  Several safety issues were identified with Amfleet cars as well. At the time, the wreck was the deadliest in Amtrak's history. In 1993, however, the wreck at Big Bayou Canot in Alabama resulted in a much larger death toll. Movements of the trains pre-collision  Amtrak Train 94Amtrak Train 94 (the Colonial) left Washington Union Station at 12:30 pm (Eastern time) for Boston South Station. The train had 16 cars and was filled with travelers returning from the holiday season to their homes and schools for the second semester of the year. Two AEM-7 locomotives, numbered 900 and 903, led the train; #903 was the lead locomotive. The engineer was 35-year-old Jerome Evans.After leaving the Baltimore, Maryland Amtrak station, the train's next stop was Wilmington, Delaware. Just north of Baltimore, while still in Baltimore County, the four-track Northeast Corridor narrows to two tracks at Gunpow Interlocking just before crossing over the Gunpowder River. The train accelerated north toward that location. Conrail light engine moveRicky Lynn Gates, a Penn Central and Conrail engineer since 1973, was operating a trio of Conrail (CR) freight locomotives (all GE B36-7 models) light (without freight cars) from Conrail's Bayview Yard just east of Baltimore bound for Enola Yard near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Gates was later determined to have violated several signal and operating rules, including a failure to properly test his cab signals as required before departure from Bayview. It was later discovered that someone had disabled the cab signal alerter whistle on lead unit #5044 with duct tape, muting it almost completely. Also, one of the light bulbs in the PRR-style cab signal display had been removed. Investigators believed these conditions probably existed prior to departure from Bayview and that they would have been revealed by a properly performed departure test.Gates and his brakeman, Edward "Butch" Cromwell, were also smoking a marijuana cigarette.  Marijuana can alter one's sense of time and impair the ability to perform tasks that require concentration.   Cromwell was responsible for calling out the signals if Gates missed them, but failed to do so. The collisionAs Amtrak Train 94 approached the Gunpow Interlocking near the Chase community on the electrified main line, the three Conrail freight locomotives were moving north on one of the adjacent freight tracks. Before the adjacent tracks reached the bridge at the river, they merged into the two (2) through tracks that cross the bridge.While the tracks and interlocking plant at this location are signalized to alert locomotive engineers when the interlocking switches are set for through track train movement, the switches are not designed to de-rail a locomotive or train that runs through them when they are aligned for through track train movement.In the case of the accident, the interlocking plant was properly set for through track movement only, so as to allow the Amtrak train to pass the freight locomotives (which should have been stopped on the side tracks) on the through tracks onto and over the bridge. The freight locomotive engineers ignored the stop signals in their locomotive cab, and at trackside, visible to them from the cab of their locomotive.Speed/event recording devices indicated that the Conrail locomotives were moving at approximately   when their brakes were applied for an emergency stop, after they had passed the trackside signals. This was, Gates later claimed, when he realized that he did not have a wayside signal to proceed north at Gunpow. He was, however, moving too fast to stop before passing the signal indicating he should stop clear of the main track on which #94 was approaching.The Conrail locomotives came to a stop on the track directly in front of #94, which approached the interlocking at  , an authorized track speed. With little time to react, Amtrak engineer Evans apparently saw the diesels on the line in front of him and applied the brakes for an emergency stop.  However, the collision was unavoidable.On impact, the rearmost Conrail diesel, GE B36-7 #5045 exploded and burned. It was completely destroyed down to frame and was never rebuilt. The middle unit, #5052, sustained significant damage but was later rebuilt and returned to service. Lead unit #5044 had little damage.One of Amtrak's AEM-7s, #900, was buried under the wreckage, while the lead locomotive, #903, ended up among some trees on the west side of the right of way. Several Budd Company Amfleet cars were piled up, with some crushed under the pile.Cromwell, who was on the lead locomotive with Gates, suffered a broken leg in the collision.  Gates was uninjured. The Amtrak engineer, lounge car LSA (lead service attendant) and 14 passengers were killed.The front cars on the Amtrak #94 train suffered the greatest extent of damage and were almost completely crushed. However they were nearly empty awaiting additional holiday passengers en route who would have boarded the train at stations further north. According to the NTSB, had these cars been fully occupied at the time, the death toll would have been at least 100. There were relatively few passengers on those cars, however, and so the death toll was much less. Most of the dead were on Amtrak car #21236. Post-collision response and cleanupWith a total passenger load of about 600 people, there was a great deal of confusion after the collision. Witnesses and neighbors ran to the smoking train and helped remove injured and dazed passengers, even before the first emergency vehicles could arrive at the location.While many of the injured passengers were aided by nearby residents, some of the uninjured passengers wandered away, making it difficult for Amtrak to know the complete story.Emergency personnel worked for many hours in the frigid cold, impeded as they were by the stainless-steel Amfleet cars' skin's resistance to the ordinary hydraulic rescue tools at their command, to extricate trapped passengers from the wreckage as helicopters and ambulances transported injured people to hospitals and trauma centers. It was over 10 hours after the collision before the final trapped people  were freed from the wreckage.It was several days before the wrecked equipment was removed and the track and electrical propulsion system were returned to service. Investigation, charges and convictionAt first, Gates and Cromwell denied smoking marijuana.  However, they later tested positive for the substance.  A National Transportation Safety Board investigation revealed that had Gates slowed down at the signals as required, he would have stopped in time.  It also determined that Gates and Cromwell's marijuana use was the "probable cause" of the accident. Roylance, Frank D. Ricky Gates: 6 years sober. Baltimore Sun, 1993-06-16.  Gates and Cromwell were immediately suspended by Conrail pending an internal investigation, but resigned rather than face certain termination.Gates was eventually charged with manslaughter by locomotive; under Maryland law a locomotive is a motor vehicle.  Prosecutors cut a deal with Cromwell in which he agreed to testify against Gates in return for immunity.  Gates was sentenced to five years in state prison and one year's probation, and was later sentenced to an additional three years on federal charges of lying to the NTSB.  Gates' history of DWI (driving while intoxicated) convictions as well as his admission that the crew had been using marijuana while on duty led for a call to certify locomotive engineers as to their qualifications and history. Toxicology tests on the Amtrak engineer's body returned negative and, in fact, his actions served only to reduce the severity of the wreck by slowing his train from  .Gates was released from prison in 1992 after serving four years, and now works as an abuse counselor. In a 1993 interview with the Baltimore Sun, Gates said the accident would have never happened if not for the marijuana.  He also revealed he'd smoked marijuana on the job several times.  Changes for future preventionAs a result of the wreck, all locomotives operating on the Northeast Corridor are now required to have automatic cab signalling with an automatic train stop feature.  Although common on passenger trains up until that time, cab signals combined with train stop and speed control had never been installed on freight locomotives due to potential train handling issues at high speed. Conrail subsequently developed a device called a locomotive speed limiter (LSL), a computerized device that is designed to monitor and control the rate of deceleration for restrictive signals in conjunction with cab signals.  All freight locomotives operated on the Northeast Corridor must now be equipped with an operating LSL which also limits top speed to  .  Previously, freight locomotives were only required to have automatic cab signals without an automatic train stop feature.Also as a direct result of this collision, federal legislation was enacted that required the FRA to develop a system of federal certification for locomotive engineers.  These regulations went into effect in January 1990.  Since then, railroads are required by law to certify that their engineers are properly trained and qualified, and that they have no drug or alcohol impairment motor vehicle convictions for the five-year period prior to certification.  Another effect was that age-old Rule G (The use of intoxicants or narcotics by employees subject to duty, or their possession or use while in duty, is prohibited. — UCOR, 1962) was revamped to:  An employee who reports for duty under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicant, cannabis in any form, an amphetamine, a narcotic, a hallucinogenic drug, any controlled substance (as defined by federal law), or a derivative or combination of any of these, or who uses any of the foregoing while on duty, will be dismissed.  Possession of any of the foregoing while on duty, or possession, use, or being under the influence of any of the foregoing while on Company or occupying facilities provided by the Company is prohibited. Source: Tennessee Valley Railroad Operating Rules book, effective March 15, 1995  Actually, a form of Rule G has existed in many railroad operating manuals for decades.  However, the federal codification of this rule was deemed necessary to assure that any violator would be dealt with in a consistent and harsh manner.  Also, anyone who passes a stop signal loses his or her FRA certification for a period not to exceed 30 days for a first offense. This is per the 49 CFR part 249.In 1991—prompted in large part by the Chase crash—Congress authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in "safety-sensitive" jobs in industries regulated by DOT. Memorial to a victim, reflection after 20 years Ten years after the collision, the McDonogh School of Owings Mills, Maryland decided to build a 448-seat theater in memory of one of the crash's victims and alumna, 16-year-old Ceres Millicent Horn. Ceres Horn graduated from the school at age 15 and enrolled and was accepted at Princeton University at age 16 where she majored in astrophysics. Her family has never ridden a train since.On January 4, 2007, the 20th anniversary of the crash, her family visited the theatre for the first time and attended a ceremony at the McDonogh School held in honor of their daughter. Also at the time of the 20th anniversary, the Baltimore Sun interviewed some of the volunteers and professionals who responded or treated injured passengers after the collision. An Amtrak signal foreman who had responded from home told the reporter: "Once you got here, your stomach just turned. It was the most devastating thing I've seen in my 30 years down here," he said. "It was a horrific scene." The man added that he didn't leave the crash site for three or four days, sometimes catching some sleep while propped against the trees lining the track. "You didn't worry about pay, you didn't worry about nothing, you just tried to help these people out," he said.Some of the "Good Samaritans" who lived close by and helped pull passengers out immediately after the collision were later invited to the White House and their efforts acknowledged by President Ronald Reagan.The Baltimore County Fire Department's medical commander at the scene 20 years earlier told the newspaper that the Amtrak crash is still being used as a case study in effective disaster response. "The reason is how the members of the professional and volunteer fire departments and the community people got together." It was, he said, "a very sad but a very proud moment" in his career.

Western Maryland Scenic Railroad  The Western Maryland Scenic Railroad (WMSR) is a heritage railroad based in Cumberland, Maryland. It operates over ex-Western Maryland Railway (WM) trackage to Frostburg, Maryland and back using both steam and diesel locomotives.The WMSR operates passenger excursion trains out of the former Western Maryland station in Cumberland, which also houses one of the six visitor centers of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park as well as other attractions and offices. This station was built in 1913.The railroad offers coach and first class service, as well as reserved caboose rides. The railroad also runs murder mystery excursions and special seasonal trips. Rail line descriptionThe track, which for the most part follows a former Western Maryland Railway line, proceeds northwest from Cumberland through "the Narrows", a deep water gap formed by the passage of Wills Creek between Haystack Mountain and Wills Mountain, parts of the Wills Mountain Anticline geological structure. The train then proceeds up the Allegheny Front through a water gap formed by Jennings Run, passes Mt. Savage, and terminates at the former Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad depot in Frostburg. The train lays over there for about 90 minutes to allow passengers to visit the town, and the locomotive is turned back there on a turntable that originally served the Western Maryland in Elkins, West Virginia.  The train then returns to Cumberland by the same route.Intermediate sights on the line include:  Helmstetter’s Curve in Cash Valley     Brush Tunnel     Woodcock Hollow, site of a hairpin curve      The Allegheny Highlands Trail of Maryland, part of the Great Allegheny Passage bicycle trail from Cumberland to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, runs along the route of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad. Cyclists can make reservations with the railroad to put their bikes on board for the climb up the mountain to Frostburg, then cycle back down to Cumberland. Locomotives Normal power for the train is ex-Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad #734, a 1916 Baldwin-built 2-8-0 steam locomotive painted in WM "fireball" livery. It was originally built for the LS&I as #34. The locomotive came to the line from the Illinois Railway Museum in 1991. After an extensive rebuild, it entered service in 1992; it has received several modifications over the years to give it more of a WM appearance. In addition, the WMSR has two ex-Conrail GP30 diesel locomotives (#501 being former PRR, #502 being former Reading). These engines are used as helper engines for the steam locomotive and as power for short excursions that are run for special events. ShopsThe WMSR operates put of the former WM's Ridgeley, West Virginia car shops located just across the Potomac River from Cumberland. The shops include offices, a Federal Railroad Administration building, and the former paint shop which is now used to house the steam engine and perform repairs on the railroad's equipment. The WMSR shops also serve as a business offering restoration services for locomotives and coaches from both commercial and private owners. South, past the Ridgely shops and yard, the WMSR also maintains a wye that is used to turn the railroad's locomotives and coaches. Passenger and Freight EquipmentSince its creation, the WMSR has gained an extensive collection of light weight style passenger coaches, many of which it either has restored to service in its maroon and gold livery, or has used for parts to restore other coaches. Many of the restored coaches are painted with the names of local area towns, as well as benefactors of the scenic railroad. The WMSR also has a collection of freight equipment it has collected from CSX and others sources that it uses for storage at the shops, rail line maintenance, and photo freight excursions. The WMSR currently also has three cabooses. They are two ex-C&O cabooses and one ex-WM caboose. Other un-restored equipment includes an ex-Chessie System crane, an ex-LS&I steam engine tender, ex-Amtrak material handling cars, heavyweight coaches and pieces for a turntable.

Maryland Route 135    Maryland Route 135 (MD 135) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as Maryland Highway, the state highway runs   from U.S. Route 219 (US 219) in Oakland in Garrett County east to US 220 in McCoole in Allegany County.  MD 135 is the main link between the towns of Oakland, Mountain Lake Park, Loch Lynn Heights, and Deer Park on the Appalachian Plateau and the communities of Bloomington, Luke, Westernport, and McCoole in the upper valley of the Potomac River.  These groups of towns are separated by Backbone Mountain.MD 135 was originally built in the early 1930s as a link between McCoole and Westernport.  In the late 1930s, the state highway was extended west to Bloomington.  In addition, a separate segment of MD 135 was completed around Swanton in the mid-1930s.  These separate segments were unified in the early 1950s when the highway over Backbone Mountain was completed.  In the late 1950s, MD 135 was extended west over a portion of MD 38 and all of Maryland Route 41 to Oakland, and was mostly rebuilt over its entire length, bypassing Bloomington, Swanton, Deer Park, and Mountain Lake Park.  MD 135 remains notorious for the eastbound descent from Backbone Mountain, which has claimed many lives.  The Maryland State Highway Administration has instituted many measures to get trucks down the mountain safely and to avoid the downgrade if possible. Route descriptionMD 135 begins at an intersection with US 219 on the eastern edge of Oakland.  Northbound US 219 (Oak Street) continues straight west into downtown Oakland, southbound US 219 (Garrett Highway) heads south toward Red House, and 9th Street heads north along the alignment of the future Oakland Bypass.  MD 135 heads east through Mountain Lake Park as Maryland Highway, a controlled access two-lane highway.  Oakland Drive, which is unsigned MD 825B, splits to the northeast to serve residential areas on the north side of town.  The old alignment rejoins MD 135 at G Street before access controls cease upon crossing the Little Youghiogheny River.  The state highway intersects MD 560 (Paull Street), which heads south into Loch Lynn Heights.  After crossing the river again, MD 135 leaves Mountain Lake Park.  The state highway passes scattered residences, farms, and businesses before entering Deer Park.  After passing Deer Park Hotel Road, which passes the Pennington Cottage, MD 135 intersects the old alignment of MD 38, which is Sand Flat Road to the north and Main Street to the south.  The state highway passes the historic home Glamorgan and Edgewood Drive, part of the old alignment of MD 38, before leaving Deer Park.  Upon reaching the hamlet of Altamont, MD 495 (Swanton Road) continues straight northeast toward Swanton while MD 135 turns to the southeast.  MD 135 heads straight southeast toward a grade-separated crossing of CSX's Mountain Subdivision very close to the railroad's crossing of the Eastern Continental Divide.  The state highway curves to the northeast and gently ascends Backbone Mountain.  A scenic overlook marks the highest point on MD 135 ( ) shortly before the intersection with MD 38 (Kitzmiller Road).  The state highway continues northeast along the ridgeline through Potomac-Garrett State Forest and intersects Swanton Road and a few roads on the south side of the highway that access Jennings Randolph Lake.  Upon leaving the state forest, MD 135 begins to pass scattered residences ahead of the descent of Backbone Mountain, which has grades as steep as 9%.  Trucks are required to stop at three different brake check locations and obey a posted speed limit of  .   After Bloomington Hill Road splits to the north and the state highway passes the third brake check stop, a runaway truck ramp splits to the south.   The downhill grade eases as MD 135 enters Bloomington, where the name of the highway changes to Bloomington Road.  After passing through residential areas, the state highway crosses the Mountain Subdivision and the Savage River before meeting Savage Hillside Road at a T intersection in front of Franklin Hill.  MD 135 turns southeast into Allegany County and enters the town of Luke as Pratt Street.  The state highway immediately intersects Masteller Road, which is unsigned MD 135D and meets the eastern end of the western segment of West Virginia Route 46 (WV 46) at the Potomac River.  At a bend in the river, MD 135 makes a sharp turn to the north around the mountain and the road passes the large NewPage Corporation paper mill.  The state highway turns east and its name changes to Church Street upon entering Westernport, where the highway intersects MD 36 (New Georges Creek Road), which crosses the Potomac River to become the eastern segment of WV 46.  MD 135 crosses Georges Creek and meets the Georges Creek Railway at-grade before intersecting Main Street, which is unsigned MD 937.  Upon leaving Westernport, the road's name changes to McCoole–Westernport Road.  MD 135 parallels the Potomac River and Georges Creek Railway as it passes scattered residences and businesses.  Upon reaching McCoole, the highway passes unsigned MD 135A, which provides an alternate access route to US 220 north.  Shortly after, MD 135 reaches Paxton Street, which is officially MD 135B but is marked as MD 135. Paxton Street leads to a junction with US 220 (McMullen Highway).  MD 135 itself continues east under the McCoole–Keyser bridge to its eastern terminus at the intersection of Queens Point Road and Golden Cross Street.   HistoryThe present course of MD 135 consists of the original course of the state highway and its extensions westward, and assumption of a portion of MD 38 and all of MD 41.  MD 135 also followed a segment of what is today MD 495.   The original segment of MD 135 was under construction between McCoole and Westernport in 1930 and completed by 1931.     The state highway was constructed between Bloomington and Luke in 1936 and 1937, including the bridge over the Savage River.    This segment was connected to Westernport in 1940 by carving a roadbed out of the cliffs of Franklin Hill.   MD 38 was paved from its original northern terminus to Altamont between 1924 and 1926 and to the top of Backbone Mountain by 1930.     The present segment of MD 38 south to Kitzmiller was under construction by 1930 and completed by 1933.    MD 41 included the first section of what is now MD 135 to be constructed; the segment of the state highway between Oakland and Mountain Lake Park was paved between 1916 and 1919.   The state highway was extended past Loch Lynn Heights in 1933 and to MD 38 in Deer Park by 1938.   A second, disconnected segment of MD 135 was constructed in two sections between MD 38 in Altamont and Swanton that were completed in 1933 and 1935.     This road was extended east to the top of Backbone Mountain in 1939.    The discontinuous segments of MD 135 were unified in 1953 when the pre-existing Bloomington Road was reconstructed between the eastern end of the western MD 135 on top of Backbone Mountain and the western end of the eastern MD 135 in Bloomington.    When the present US 220 bridge over the Potomac River was completed in 1951, MD 135 was extended east from its old intersection with US 220, which is today the intersection with MD 135A, to its present eastern terminus. MD 135 attained its present alignment through several projects in the mid to late 1950s, concurrent with MD 135's extension west over part of MD 38 and all of MD 41 to Oakland in 1956.   The segment of MD 38 in Deer Park was bypassed by the newly extended state highway in 1956.    The state highway between McCoole and Westernport was relocated, and Bloomington Hill Road was bypassed with a straighter highway featuring a grade-separated crossing of the railroad in Bloomington in 1956 and 1957.    The present section of MD 135 between MD 38 and Swanton Road was built in 1955 and 1956; MD 135 was then removed through Swanton and partially replaced by MD 495.    The segment between Swanton Road and Bloomington Hill Road was upgraded between 1953 and 1956.    Finally, the portion of MD 135 between Deer Park and Oakland, including the bypass of Mountain Lake Park, was rebuilt between 1957 and 1959.  Since the present alignment of MD 135 was completed west of Bloomington in the late 1950s, the descent of Backbone Mountain has become notorious due to its steep grade and the 90 degree turn at the bottom to avoid a mountain dead ahead.  A retaining wall at the bottom of the mountain features white crosses in memoriam of those who lost their lives; there were 24 crosses painted as of 2009.  After five people had been killed on the descent by 1965, the State Roads Commission responded in 1967 by enacting the truck speed limit of  , marking the three mandatory stopping areas, and installing ample warning signage, including the infamous "If Brakes Fail Ditch Truck Immediately" sign.  In 1997, signs were installed on Interstate 68, US 219, and US 40 advising truckers to use MD 36 instead of MD 135 to access Luke and Westernport.   The runaway truck ramp was installed by 2005 and supplemented with a runaway truck warning system and updated signage in 2007.   Junction list                        Auxiliary routes  MD 135A is the unsigned designation for the unnamed   connector between MD 135 in McCoole and US 220 north of McCoole.  The state highway heads north from MD 135 on the western edge of McCoole and passes under US 220.  MD 135A curves northwest and intersects Burke Hill Road before reaching its northern terminus at an oblique intersection with US 220 opposite Red Rock Lane.  MD 135A is part of the original alignment of US 220 through McCoole prior to the completion of the present alignment in 1951.   MD 135B is the designation for Paxton Street, a   connector between MD 135 and US 220 in McCoole.  MD 135B is signed as MD 135.   MD 135C is the unsigned designation for an unnamed   connector between MD 135 and MD 825C, itself an unsigned and unnamed highway, on top of Backbone Mountain east of MD 38.  MD 135C provides access to a salt dome.  MD 135D is the unsigned designation for Masteller Road, a   connector between MD 135 in Luke and the western segment of WV 46 across the Potomac River in Beryl.

Oldtown, Maryland   Oldtown is an unincorporated community in Allegany County, Maryland along the North Branch Potomac River founded in 18th century colonial times. The settlement was initially called "Shawanese Old Town" because it was the site of a Shawnee Amerindian village abandoned about a decade earlier. In later years the explanatory prefix was dropped from the name and the place because known simply as "Oldtown.     Oldtown was begun (on a soon to be busy road) with the building of a trading post along an old Native American trail, the Nemacolin Trail, as traders, especially fur traders (and trappers) pushed over the Cumberland Narrows Mountain pass into the Monongahela River valley and found the trail could make a safe descent along a reasonable grade down to the river in the area of a river ford overlooked by the bluffs and mounds of the Redstone Old Fort area, now Brownsville in Fayette County in Western Pennsylvania. The trading post was established in 1741 by Thomas Cresap, who'd figured  prominently in the Conejohela War, (also called Cresap's War).  Shortly after the war, he moved west to the sparsely settled frontier from the more populated regions of York County, Pennsylvania and the Conejohela Flats. Cressap may have been acting, in moving to the frontier, as an agent of Lord Baltimore. The move positioned him to play a role in opening the as yet unchartered Ohio Country. Cresap opened a road westward under the auspices of the Ohio Company once a charter was granted for Ohio.Cresap's son Michael Cresap was born at Oldtown, the first white male born in Allegany County, Maryland.A post office was established there on May 26, 1870. Oldtown is connected by a one-lane low water toll bridge to Green Spring in Hampshire County, West Virginia.The "Chesapeake & Ohio Canal" reached Cumberland, MD from Georgetown (Washington, DC) in 1850 by way of Oldtown at Milepost 166.5. The "Baltimore & Ohio Railroad", located just across the Potomac from Oldtown had reached Cumberland eight years earlier. The canal finally closed operations as a carrier in 1924 due to flood damage. The B&O Railroad, now CSX, continues to be a major carrier; and it is used daily by Amtrak's "Capitol Limited" between Washington, DC and Chicago.The "Western Maryland Railway" expanded west, from Big Pool, MD to Cumberland, MD as a Class-I Railroad in 1906 with the mainline being constructed through Oldtown complete with a train station located at the lower end of town.  Passenger service ended on the Western Maryland Railway between Cumberland and Hagerstown, MD on May 30, 1953. Afterwards it was not uncommon for B&O Passenger trains to be rerouted over the WM through Oldtown. The last scheduled mainline trains through Oldtown occurred on May 12, 1975 for freight, and May 21, 1975 for a Chessie System Passenger Special. The line was officially abandoned as part of the "Chessie System" consolidation and all WM trains began running on the nearby B&O. A Chessie System work train pulled up the rails through Oldtown in June 1976. In 1924 a six classroom/auditorium brick school was erected along Main Street with the first class graduating from there in 1925. In 1939 an identical new high school section was added to the south end of the present school which increased the classroom total to fourteen. It included a new cafeteria, office and faculty room. During the 1954-55 school year yet another high school section was added along with a new vocational agricultural shop, a furnace room and a brand new combination gym/auditorium which could seat 900 people. During the summer of 1977 the 1925 and 1939 sections were torn down and a new present day first floor section was constructed on the east side of where the old sections stood. Finally in 2000 the 76th and final class graduated from Oldtown High School and the school closed. Today it is privately owned and a restaurant is now located in the former school cafeteria.The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.     The Michael Cresap House was listed in 1972 and the Shawnee Old Fields Village Site in 1975.

Steele was expected to win the Republican Primary, even to the point where Maryland Public Television personality Jeff Salkin declared at a Maryland League of Women Voters debate that Steele is "unopposed.".   Among a field of nine other candidates, the only Republican receiving sufficient media coverage was Daniel Vovak. Results                          General election Candidates  Michael S. Steele (R)- Lieutenant Governor Ben Cardin (D)- U.S. Congressman Kevin Zeese (G)- (Campaign website). Zeese won the nominations of the Maryland Green Party, the Libertarian Party of Maryland,  and the Populist Party of Maryland, the first time all three parties had nominated the same candidate. However, a Maryland law passed in April 2006 prohibited such fusion candidacies, so Zeese, who was a registered Green Party member, was listed on the ballot as only the Green Party candidate.     CampaignThis was Maryland's first open Senate seat since 1986, when junior Senator Barbara Mikulski was first elected. Michael Steele won the Republican nomination after facing little competition in the contest for the Republican ticket. With mostly unknown secondary candidates, Steele received 87% of the Republican Primary vote.  Third District Congressional Representative Ben Cardin won the Democratic Party nomination after facing tough competition in the contest for the Democratic ticket from former congressman and NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, businessman Josh Rales, former Baltimore County Executive Dennis F. Rasmussen, and several lesser known candidates.  Cardin received 44% of the Democratic Primary vote to 40% for Mfume, his next closest competitor.  All other candidates received percentages only in the single digits.Kevin Zeese, the nominee for the Green, Populist and Libertarian Parties, was also on the ballot.  Though Steele lost the general election by 10%, a much wider margin than predicted, his was the best showing for a Republican in a Senate race in Maryland since Charles Mathias, Jr. was reelected in 1980 with 66% of the vote. Controversies Both Steele and Cardin made controversial statements and advertising throughout the campaign. DebatesThe first debate of the race was held Tuesday, October 3, 2006.  All three candidates were present and participated.  The evening was hosted by the Baltimore Urban League, and moderated by Charles Robinson from Maryland Public Television and Doni Glover from BMORENEWS. The first televised debate of the campaign was broadcast on News Channel 8 on the program "News Talk".  All three candidates participated in the debate, and were moderated by Bruce DePuyt, the host of the program.  There was no audience.  This debate was widely reported because of the constant bickering between the three candidates, who often interrupted and talked over one another. Another debate took place between Steele and Cardin on Sunday, October 29, 2006 as a part of the Meet The Press Senatorial debate series.  Moderated by Tim Russert, the debate focused primarily on the Iraq War and stem-cell research, amongst other issues. The three candidates all participated in the final debate of the campaign on Friday, November 3, 2006.  The event was sponsored by the Collective Banking Group and held at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden.  TacticsCardin primarily attacked Steele over his close relations with President Bush, including pictures of Bush and Steele in Cardin's TV ads.   Steele focused on low taxes, less government spending, free markets and national security.

Laurel High School (Laurel, Maryland)       Laurel High School is a public high school located in Laurel, Maryland, and is the oldest school in the Prince George's County Public Schools system.  HistoryLaurel High School  was founded in 1899 with an enrollment of 59 students and four teachers, the original school building is now the Phelps Community Center in Laurel. The cupola on top was used during WWII as a Civil Defense Aircraft Spotting Station for identifying enemy aircraft.  The original building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  In 1965, the school moved to a larger building at 8000 Cherry Lane in Laurel, and annexed an adjacent elementary school in the 1983. Today, Laurel High School enrolls roughly 1,990 students in grades 9 through 12. The school mascot is the Spartan, and the school colors are blue and gold.Fulfilling an objective of the Prince George’s County Capital Improvement Program  since 1989, construction on a new 800-seat auditorium for the school is expected to begin in February 2009. The addition was completed in early 2010 school year. Laurel High's student newspaper, The Shield, established in the 1995–1996 school year, has won awards from the American Scholastic Press Association and the Columbia Scholastic Press Association.   Prior to 1995–96 school year, the school paper operated under the name "The Tattler".On September 24, 2001 an F-2/F-3 tornado (which originated over Washington, D.C.) severely damaged the roof and several rooms in the annexed portion of Laurel High School, as well as numerous: homes, trees and other structures along a narrow path, through the center of the city, before dissipating in Howard County, MD.Since August 2007, school policy requires students to wear uniforms. FacultyPrincipal Dwayne Jones is a former Laurel High student and was a member of the last Laurel High Basketball Team to win a state title. PublicityIn 2004 Sheryl Cashin said in The Failures of Integration: How Race and Class are Undermining the American Dream that Laurel High was one of several mostly black, mostly middle class PG County public high schools that was "decidedly underachieving: fewer than half of the seniors at these schools went on to attend four-year colleges in recent years."

Liberty High School (Carroll County, Maryland)   For schools with similar names, see Liberty High School.  Liberty High School (LHS) is a four-year public high school in Eldersburg in Carroll County, Maryland, United States at  5855 Bartholow Road. The current Principal of the school is Thomas Clowes. About the SchoolLiberty High School was established in 1980 in Eldersburg, Maryland as part of the Carroll County Public School system.The school's first graduation ceremony was held in 1982. Since that time, 27 classes have graduated from Liberty High School.Liberty follows a class schedule different from that followed in the rest of the county. Each class meets every other day (every pre-determined "A" or "B" day), with four class periods each day. Thus, it takes a student two days to attend every one of their classes. Because of this schedule, 1 credit courses are held the entire school year, with .5 credit courses held during 1 semester, half of the school year. Some courses, such as Advanced AP Calculus, meet on both "A" and "B" days during the entire year, and thus are worth 2 credits. Following is a schedule that could be given to an incoming freshman.  Fall Semester  Period "A" Day "B" Day  1 Government 1 credit English I 1 credit  2 Business Comm. & Keyboarding 1 credit Drama I ½ credit  3 Chemistry I 1 credit Conceptual Physics 1 credit  4 Algebra A/B 2 credits Algebra A/B 2 credits  Spring Semester  Period "A" Day "B" Day  1 Government 1 credit English I 1 credit  2 Business Comm. & Keyboarding 1 credit Physical Education I ½ credit  3 Chemistry I 1 credit Conceptual Physics 1 credit  4 Algebra A/B 2 credits Algebra A/B 2 credits  On December 13, 2007, the Washington Post announced that Liberty High School is in the top 5% of all U.S. High Schools in encouraging students to take AP tests. In this study, Liberty High School fares better most other High Schools in Carroll County. Liberty High School's mascot is a lion. It is represented as an African lion; in comparison, Penn State College’s mascot, the Nittany Lions, is shown as a mountain lion, a species native to the United States.

Maryland Route 36  Maryland Route 36 (also known as MD 36 or Route 36) is a   state highway located in Allegany County, Maryland, United States. MD 36's southern terminus is at the WV 46 bridge in Westernport and its northern terminus at U.S. Route 40 Alternate near Cumberland. Between Westernport and Frostburg, it is known as Georges Creek Road, and from Frostburg to Cumberland it is known as Mount Savage Road. Like the majority of Maryland state highways, MD 36 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA).MD 36 serves as the main road through the Georges Creek Valley, a region which is historically known for coal mining, and has been designated by MDSHA as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway.    MD 36 is the main road connecting the towns of Westernport, Lonaconing, and Midland in southwestern Allegany County, as well as Frostburg, Mount Savage, and Corriganville in northwestern Allegany County. Route descriptionMD 36 has two main sections: Georges Creek Road, which runs along the Georges Creek Valley, from Westernport to Frostburg in southwestern Allegany County, and Mount Savage Road, which runs eastward from Frostburg to Cumberland in northwestern Allegany County. Georges Creek RoadMD 36 begins at the West Virginia Route 46 (WV 46) bridge in Westernport and runs northeast across western Allegany County as a two-lane road named Georges Creek Road, named for Georges Creek, a Potomac River tributary which the road parallels.  The speed limit for most of the length between Westernport and Lonaconing is  .  A short distance outside Westernport city limits, MD 36 intersects MD 937, an old alignment of MD 36. Near Barton, MD 36 intersects MD 935, which is the old alignment of MD 36 through Barton. MD 36 bypasses Barton, climbing the hillside above the Georges Creek Valley before descending back into the valley as it approaches Lonaconing. MD 935 returns to MD 36 south of Lonaconing, with its northern terminus at MD 36.  As the road enters Lonaconing, it narrows and the speed limit drops to  , increasing to   after it travels through Lonaconing.  MD 36 passes through Lonaconing as Main Street, and it intersects MD 657 near the center of Lonaconing.  Along Main Street in Lonaconing is the Lonaconing Iron Furnace, a historic blast furnace which operated in the early 19th century.   MD 36 then continues toward Midland. At Midland, there is a sharp curve in the road, and the speed limit drops to  .  Along this curve, MD 36 intersects Church Street, which connects to MD 936, the old alignment of MD 36 between Midland and Frostburg. The new alignment of MD 36 proceeds northeast, passing near Vale Summit, where it intersects MD 55. North of the MD 55 intersection, MD 36 meets Interstate 68 at a diamond interchange at exit 34.  Near this interchange is God's Ark of Safety, a church famous for its attempt to build a replica of Noah's Ark.    Between Midland and Frostburg, the speed limit is again  ,  and there is a short section near the Interstate 68 interchange where MD 36 expands to four lanes. Upon entering Frostburg, MD 36 joins   as Main Street. MD 36 follows Main Street westward through Frostburg, meeting the northern terminus of MD 936 at Grant Street. At Depot Street, near the center of Frostburg, MD 36 connects to the western depot of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad. At the intersection with Water Street, MD 36 leaves  , and upon leaving Frostburg city limits its name changes to Mount Savage Road.  Mount Savage Road After leaving Frostburg, MD 36 is known as Mount Savage Road, as it travels eastward, perpendicular to its signed direction, toward Mount Savage. North of Eckhart Mines, MD 36 meets MD 638, which connects MD 36 to   in Eckhart Mines.  The road between Frostburg and Mount Savage is particularly curvy, and includes several hairpin turns near Frostburg. The speed limit on this section of the road is  . As the road enters Mount Savage, is passes by the Mount Savage Castle, a Scottish-style castle built in 1840, which currently operates as a bed-and-breakfast. In Mount Savage, the route narrows as it follows Main Street,  and the road is frequently obstructed by parked cars, making it difficult for two cars to pass by each other. East of Mount Savage, the route widens and its speed limit gradually increases to  . In Barrelville, MD 36 intersects MD 47, which connects it with PA 160 in Somerset County.  From its intersection with MD 47 to its terminus at Cumberland, MD 36 follows newer alignments, with the old alignments being designated MD 831. At Corriganville, MD 36 intersects MD 35, which connects it with PA 96 in Bedford County.  MD 36 ends at U.S. Route 40 Alternate at the Narrows near Cumberland.  History MD 36 passes through the Georges Creek Valley, which has a long history of coal mining. In recognition of this, the MDSHA has designated MD 36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway.  Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley.    Deep mining, which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after World War II, replaced primarily by surface mining.    Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production,  coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.   MD 36 was assigned a route number before 1927, earlier than most of the other Maryland state highways.       The original alignment of MD 36 in southern Allegany County closely paralleled the Georges Creek Railroad. Later realignments have shifted MD 36 away from the railroad in several locations, but three crossings remain: one north of Lonaconing, one south of Lonaconing near the MD 935 intersection,    and a third crossing near Westernport.   Over the years, multiple new alignments of MD 36 have been built for various reasons, such as to smooth out curves in the road. Several of the old alignments have been assigned route numbers of their own. The southernmost of these is MD 937, which consists of the old alignment through Westernport. Prior to the construction of the bridge connecting MD 36 to WV 46, MD 937 was the alignment of MD 36 through Westernport, ending at MD 135. In Barton, MD 935 carries the old alignment of MD 36. The longest of the old alignment sections is MD 936, which runs from Midland to Frostburg, and was bypassed in the 1970s with a new alignment of MD 36 following part of MD 55 and connecting to  . Prior to this change, MD 55 ended in Midland;  it has since been truncated to its current terminus at Vale Summit.   North of Frostburg, several old alignments are designated as MD 831, though these segments of road are not signed. Among these segments of road are Kriegbaum Road (designated as MD 831C), and Old Mount Savage Road (designated as MD 831A). Kriegbaum Road splits from MD 36 west of Corriganville and runs through Corriganville, returning to MD 36 east of the town. Old Mount Savage Road intersects MD 36 west of the Cumberland Narrows, and runs southward to intersect   near its current intersection with MD 36.

He served as delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Maryland in 1924 and 1944, and as Attorney General of Maryland from 1945–1946. References                     
Maryland Route 90      Maryland Route 90 (MD 90) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as the Ocean City Expressway, the state highway runs   from U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Whaleyville to MD 528 in Ocean City.  MD 90 is a two-lane expressway that provides one of the main access routes to Ocean City, especially the northern part of the resort, and thus sees heavy seasonal traffic.  Due to its importance as an access point and as an evacuation route, the state highway is a part of the National Highway System.   MD 90 was constructed from Ocean City starting in 1970.  The state highway was opened west to MD 589 in 1972 and to US 113 in 1975.  MD 90 was completed west to US 50 in 1976. Route descriptionMD 90 begins at a partial directional interchange with US 50 (Ocean Gateway) east of Whaleyville.  There is no access from westbound MD 90 to eastbound US 50 or from westbound US 50 to eastbound MD 90. MD 90 heads east as a two-lane undivided freeway with a speed limit of   and rumble strips within the painted median.  Headlight use is required at all times.  After passing under MD 346 (Old Ocean City Boulevard) with no access, the state highway crosses over Church Branch.  MD 90 crosses over the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad before reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 113 (Worcester Highway). After passing over MD 575 (Worcester Highway), the old alignment of US 113, with no access, the state highway becomes divided with a narrow guardrail median barrier.  MD 90 continues east through Ocean Pines, where the highway has a diamond interchange with MD 589 (Racetrack Road) and passes over Ocean Parkway within that community.  The median barrier ends and the state highway becomes an undivided highway again immediately before crossing the St. Martin River on a long bridge.  A median returns right after the bridge ends at Isle of Wight, where MD 90 has an at-grade signalized intersection with St. Martins Neck Road and the entrance to Isle of Wight Nature Park.  MD 90 becomes undivided again for the Assawoman Bay Bridge over Assawoman Bay.  After that bridge, the speed limit drops to   and the state highway expands to four lanes with a Jersey barrier for a short distance before its terminal intersection with MD 528 (Coastal Highway) at 62nd Street in Ocean City.   History Construction on MD 90 began in 1970 with the construction of the bridges over the St. Martin River and Assawoman Bay, which were completed in 1970 and 1971, respectively.     The state highway was completed and opened between MD 528 and MD 589 in 1972.   Construction west to US 113 commenced in 1973 and west to US 50 in 1974.      MD 90 was extended west to US 113, which at the time followed today's MD 575, in 1975.   The state highway was completed when the highway opened between US 50 and US 113 in 1976.    MD 90's present interchange with US 113 was constructed in 1976.   However, the interchange remained unused until US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from Berlin north past MD 90 in 2000.     The interchange ramp with MD 575 was closed and removed shortly after the new interchange opened.  Mayor Rick Meehan of Ocean City is currently pushing for dualization of the MD 90 bridge, stating that it "is the quicker way in and out of town, especially if you look at all the development that has taken place along the Route 50 corridor."  He also stated that dualization is good for the route for evacuation purposes.  Junction list                  See also      References  External links   MDRoads: MD 90

Maryland Route 108  Maryland Route 108 is a suburban state highway in the central part of the U.S. state of Maryland, starting in Damascus and ending near Columbia. Route descriptionMaryland Route 108 takes a very sinuous route through the Maryland exurbs located in between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.  It begins at Maryland Route 27 in Damascus, located in northern Montgomery County. It then proceeds to sweep south through farmland towards Olney where it intersects with MD 97, also known as Georgia Avenue.It then travels east towards the Patuxent River, passing the historic communities of Sandy Spring and Ashton, where it crosses MD 650 New Hampshire Avenue.After crossing the Patuxent into Howard County,  MD 108 trends back north to Clarksville, where it crosses MD 32.It then trends east again, forming the northern border of the planned community of Columbia and intersecting with US 29, a major north–south thoroughfare.  The road then takes its final curve south, ending at Maryland Route 175 just west of Interstate 95 in the vicinity of Guilford.The road generally follows a two-lane format.  At major intersections, such as those at MD 32 and MD 29, it expands to four lanes.  The stretch of the road around Olney is the only exception to this rule, forming four lanes for several miles due to the commercial nature of the area.  The stretch in Olney also carries two parallel bike paths for most of its four-lane orientation, with one-way frontage roads in places. HistoryThe section between the route's current interchange with US 29 in Columbia and its intersection with Maryland Route 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) in Ashton is the former route of US 29 prior to the start of construction of the planned community of Columbia, which began in the late 1960s; the route forms the northern boundary of the town.  Before the diversion of US 29, MD 108 ended in Ashton at an intersection with the U.S. route.The section of MD 108 between MD 104 (in Ellicott City) and the route's eastern terminus at MD 175 was a former alignment of MD 175 before the construction of 175's current route through the heart of Columbia.The segment of MD 108 between US 29 and MD 104 was once designated Maryland Route 539.Before the construction of the Patuxent Freeway between MD 108 and US 29, MD 32 once overlapped MD 108 through Clarksville for a short distance before turning onto a new alignment. The western end of the concurrency was at Guilford Rd., while the eastern end is now Exit 20 from MD 32.

Fine artsAll Good Counsel students are required to fulfill at least one art credit before graduation. However, many of the students in the arts programs are those who return every year to the program and advance through the different levels. Those seeking to fulfill just the one required credit enroll in what recurring students think of as classes largely intended for Freshmen (Beginning Percussion, Men's Chorus, Art Fundamentals, Intro to the Arts, and Intro to Theater).Good Counsel has a vibrant visual arts program. This begins with the Art Fundamentals course, and continues through a variety of other courses that focus on drawing, sculpting, and artwork in other mediums.

Many of the students in Marching Band also participate in the Pep Band, a more low-key ensemble that plays at most of the home basketball games.  Each year (around April), the majority of the students in the Fine Arts department participate in a "Band/Chorus Trip" to compete against other bands and choruses from around the country. This trip is an opportunity for students to experience and observe the sounds and techniques of bands and choruses from other regions of the nation. Recent trips have taken students and teachers to Disney World, Virginia Beach, The Bahamas, Toronto, and Myrtle Beach.The school also has a rapidly developing theatrical department. Although the school has consistently put on a couple of shows a year, it is only within the past couple of years that Drama classes have become part of the curriculum.

Adamstown, Maryland  Adamstown is an unincorporated community located in Frederick County, Maryland, USA. It is named for Adam Kohlenberg (March 11, 1819 - January 1, 1868), a station agent and first town merchant who owned much of present-day Adamstown. EventsThe largest area-wide event is the Carroll Manor Fire Company Carnival which occurs every June. HistoryAdamstown lies in the fertile valley between Sugarloaf and Catoctin Mountain on Carrollton Manor, a   estate originally owned by Charles Carroll of Carrollton.  Until 2000, it was a little-altered representative of mid-19th century linear town planning.  It is significant in architecture for its variety of structures, including residential, commercial, industrial, educational, agricultural, and religious buildings.  The late 18th century road from Jefferson to Greenfield Mills on the Monocacy River, originally called the Bridal Road, followed the route of the present-day Mountville Road. The 1832 arrival of the railroad to the Manor created the economic and transportation impetus for the development of the community.  Adamstown was first known as Davis' Warehouse because Dr. Meredith Davis, a leading Quaker county miller, built a warehouse about 1835 where Mountville Road, by then called Jefferson Road, crosses the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (nine miles westward from Frederick, Maryland) to store flour from his Greenfield Mills. The first settler in Adamstown was Robert Palmer, an African American "post and railer" who also ran a general store around 1835. In 1840 when Adam Kohlenburg was appointed the first B&O railway agent, the community became Adamstown after his given name.  He was also the first postmaster and ran a general store located in the lot between his brick Italianate-style home and the railroad. Edward Hebb laid off lots on the north side of the railroad in the 1840s.  Daniel Rhodes of Pennsylvania, the first white settler, was so impressed with the location, he bought a tract of land and laid it off into 12 building lots on the south side of the railroad in 1856.  With Adamstown located so close to the Potomac River and Virginia, its citizens were almost exclusively loyal to the South; however both Federal and Confederate troops were constantly moving on Carrollton Manor. For several months in the spring of 1861, the Minute Men of Adamstown, a secession militia company composed of three officers (Captain Robert H. E. Boteler; 1st Lieutenant Jacob G. Thomas; and 2nd Lieutenant William Hilleary Johnson, all local doctors) planted a pole and flew the Confederate flag adjacent to their guard post next to the B&O railroad.  Many skirmishes in the American Civil War were fought here and the town was often raided, most notoriously by the 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry, also known as Mosby's Rangers, on July 30 and October 14, 1864.  On one of these raids, Adam Kohlenburg's  entire stock was taken.  Local folklore holds that one family had a son fighting for the North and one fighting for the South.In 1902, Jacob Klein's Addition to Adamstown included the area of Washington, Adams, and Tuscarora Streets. The Adamstown Bank was established in 1917 and the building opened in 1919. In 1921 Adamstown had two large grain elevators (Farmers Exchange of Frederick and Thomas & Co.), a blacksmith shop, a carriage works, two garages, a general store, a hardware store, a butcher shop and the Bank. 1921 was also the year that electric lights were first installed in the town. DemographicsThree new developments with a total of 540 homes have been constructed in Adamstown since 2000 (Green Hill Manor, Saddle Ridge and Adamstown Commons). The population in 1880 was 66 and approximately 500 in 1971.  As of the census  of 2000, there are 2,920 people, 1,049 households and 829 families residing in Adamstown. The racial makeup of the county is 92.7% White, 4.9% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.2% from other races, and 1.3% from two or more races. 1.6% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race.There are 1,049 households out of which 36.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 69.3% are married couples living together, 5.8% have a female householder with no husband present, and 21.0% are non-families. 20.10% of all households are made up of individuals and 9.1% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.77 and the average family size is 3.12.Adamstown's population is spread out with 28.8% under the age of 19, 2.9% from 20 to 24, 29.4% from 25 to 44, 24.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.5% who are 65 years of age or older.

Brady v. Maryland   Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963),  was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the prosecution had withheld from the criminal defendant certain evidence. The defendant challenged his conviction, arguing it had been contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Procedural History Maryland prosecuted Brady and a companion, Boblit, for murder. Brady admitted being involved in the murder, but claimed Boblit had done the actual killing. The prosecution had withheld a written statement by Boblit confessing that he had committed the act of killing by himself. The Maryland Court of Appeals had affirmed the conviction and remanded the case for a retrial only on the question of punishment. The Court's Decision The Supreme Court held that withholding exculpatory evidence violates due process "where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment"; and the court determined that under Maryland state law the withheld evidence could not have exculpated the defendant but was material to the level of punishment he would be given. Hence the Maryland Court of Appeals' ruling was affirmed.A defendant's request for "Brady disclosure" refers to the holding of the Brady case, and the numerous state and federal cases that interpret its requirement that the prosecution disclose material exculpatory evidence to the defense. Exculpatory evidence is “material” if “there is a reasonable probability that his conviction or sentence would have been different had these materials been disclosed.”  Brady evidence includes statements of witnesses or physical evidence that conflicts with the prosecution's witnesses,  and evidence that could allow the defense to impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness.  Aftermath Police officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as "Brady cops." Because of the Brady ruling, prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys whenever a law enforcement official involved in their case has a sustained record for knowingly lying in an official capacity.  Brady evidence also includes evidence material to credibility of a civilian witness, such as evidence of false statements by the witness or evidence that a witness was paid to act as an informant.

Past fall musical performances include: 2011 –  2010 –  2009 –  2008 – Rent (School Edition) 2007 – Kiss Me Kate 2006 – Singin' in the Rain 2005 – West Side Story 2004 – Big the Musical 2003 – Guys and Dolls 2002 – The Music Man 2001 – Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat 2000 – The Pajama GameChurchill is well known for its annual Blast from the Past production, in which more than 200 student singers, dancers and musicians perform a variety of popular songs. These songs range from the 1920s to modern day, and they all relate to a selected theme for each school year.David Levin and Kristofer Sanz conduct Churchill's bands and orchestras. Levin is also the conductor of the Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras (MCYO) Philharmonic Orchestra.Many students form their own bands, typically of a rock variety, and the school occasionally facilitates this by sponsoring a battle of the bands or band performance. Sometimes, the school has sponsored day-long concerts to take place on school grounds. For example, The Merritthon, a fundraising event for Leukemia research, occurred annually from 2002 to 2004. In 2009, the instrumental music program won four awards at the Windy City Classic, including Best Symphonic Band, Best Orchestra, Best Classical Soloist and Best Overall Program. The jazz band received second place in that category. All three groups received a gold rating.  PublicationsChurchill produces three publications, all of which have won awards: its newspaper, The Churchill Observer; its yearbook, Finest Hours, and its literary magazine, Erehwon.    Each publication is accompanied by three levels of instruction in the related publishing topics. MisconductIn January 2010, a criminal investigation exposed a grade changing scandal at Churchill.  Law enforcement, prosecutors, and school officials examined the actions of many students who used a USB key logger to compromise teachers' passwords and alter the grades of hundreds of students.  Three of the eight students identified as agents withdrew from the school, others were expelled.  Many of the students who left the school eventually returned.

Ruxton-Riderwood, Maryland Ruxton and Riderwood are unincorporated areas in Baltimore County, Maryland.  They are sometimes considered a part of Towson and are part of Towson's census area.The boundaries of Ruxton have been established largely by local custom. Both the eastern boundary, Charles Street, and the western, Falls Road, are generally agreed upon. The northern and southern boundaries are somewhat imprecise. To the northeast, Ruxton and neighboring Riderwood are bounded by the Baltimore Beltway (I-695); to the northwest, affiliation with Ruxton follows West Joppa Road, the Old Court Road extension alongside the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway (I-83), and finally Ruxton Road to the intersection with Falls. A southern boundary can be discerned by drawing a crude line from the southerly intersection of Bellona Avenue and Charles to the intersection of West Lake Avenue and Falls. Brief History of RuxtonRuxton was once the location of the country estates of Baltimore's wealthy landed gentry.  Though the area became suburbanized during the course of the twentieth century, Ruxton is still considered one of the premier neighborhoods in the Baltimore area, along with Roland Park, Homeland, Guilford and the Falls Road corridor.  Many of the original estates still remain, though there have been many new homes built between them.The St. John's Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.   In 1994, the movie Serial Mom was filmed in Ruxton at the Church of the Good Shepherd, on Boyce Avenue.In 2005, Australian actress Nicole Kidman moved into Ruxton, renting a house in the  Four Winds neighborhood, on Boyce Avenue, as she filmed her movie The Invasion in downtown Baltimore opposite Daniel Craig. Transportation Roads Ruxton Road  Ruxton Road is a 1½-mile road, bearing the name of the area, and is the main west-east road running through the area. The road is mostly lined with upscale housing, but also has an interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway (exit 12). The road begins as a physical continuation to Old Court Road (though an extension to Old Court exists following a left turn), and ends at Bellona Avenue following a crossing over the track of the Light Rail. There is no stop along the Light Rail at this point. Bellona Avenue  Maryland Route 134, better known as Bellona Avenue is the main north-south road running through Ruxton and Riderwood. From the portion of Bellona Avenue through these communities, the track of the Light Rail is visible, though there are no stops. A small number of apartments and historic shopping districts can be found along Bellona Avenue, though the remainder of the road is mostly undeveloped. West Joppa Road  West Joppa Road, a major cross-county artery, passes through Riderwood as it intersects with Bellona Avenue. The road is mostly lined with upscale housing. Joppa Road ends in the west at nearby Greenspring Station. Falls Road  Maryland Route 25, better known as Falls Road, forms part of the western boundary of these communities, leading to the Brooklandville area. Though the road has a mostly sparse appearance, a small number of landmarks are visible in this area, including The Cloisters and Brightwood Nursing Home    Street  Maryland Route 139, better known as Charles Street, is said by many to form the eastern boundary of Ruxton. Several landmarks on this route, which intersects with I-695 in this area (exit 25), contain "Ruxton" in their name. Public TransportationPrior to 1990, buses operated along Ruxton Road. However, bus service in the Ruxton area is presently very limited. Currently, bus Route M-10 operates on Falls Road on weekdays, though it is seldom used to reach this area. Route 11, which operates mostly along Charles Street, provides two daily trips along Bellona Avenue through Ruxton, though ridership in this area is very low, and it has sometimes been proposed for elimination.When the Light Rail was initially proposed, stops were considered in the Ruxton and Riderwood areas, but these were fought by area residents   Since the light rail began operating, stops have been considered there at times, but never constructed. Schools Ruxton is served by Riderwood Elementary School, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School, all Blue Ribbon Schools in the Baltimore County Public Schools system.  However, a large majority of Ruxton students attend area private schools such as St. Paul's School, Gilman School, Roland Park Country School (RPCS), Friends School, McDonogh, Bryn Mawr School, Boys' Latin School, and Garrison Forest School in Owings Mills. Recreation The L'Hirondelle Country Club is located in Ruxton.Robert E. Lee Park stretches from Roland Park to Lutherville, covering a large area in and around Ruxton.  The park provides a large, densely wooded area containing hiking trails, a stream, and Lake Roland.  References       
Benton v. Maryland     Benton v. Maryland,  , is a Supreme Court of the United States decision concerning double jeopardy. Benton ruled that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment does apply to the states. In doing so, Benton expressly overruled Palko v. Connecticut,  . Facts of the caseJohn Dalmer Benton was tried on charges of larceny and burglary. He was acquitted of larceny but convicted of burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.Shortly after Benton's conviction, the Maryland Court of Appeals had ruled in Schowgurow v. State that the portion of the Maryland Constitution which had required all jurors to swear their belief in the existence of God was itself unconstitutional. Since the jurors in Benton's case had been selected under the unconstitutional provision, he was given the option of demanding a new trial. Benton did in fact choose to undergo a new trial, but at the second trial, the state again charged Benton with larceny even though he had been acquitted of larceny in the first trial. The second trial concluded with Benton being found guilty of both burglary and larceny. Case historyThe case was argued December 12, 1968, reargued March 24, 1969, and decided June 23, 1969. It was reargued because the original argument for which the case was granted certiorari was limited to consideration of two issues: "(1) Is the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment? and (2) If so, was the petitioner 'twice put in jeopardy' in this case?" At the second trial Benton's sentence of 15 years on the burglary count and five years for the larceny was to run concurrently, and after oral argument, as Justice Marshall wrote in his opinion of the court, "it became clear that the existence of a concurrent sentence on the burglary count might prevent the Court from reaching the double jeopardy issue, at least if we found that any error affected only petitioner's larceny conviction. The case was scheduled for reargument, 393 U. S. 994 (1968), limited to the following additional question not included in the original writ: "Does the 'concurrent sentence doctrine,' enunciated in Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 105, and subsequent cases, have continuing validity in light of such decisions as Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 633, n. 2, Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 237-238, and Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 50-58?" Decision of the courtThe Supreme Court ruled that the second trial constituted double jeopardy. There was no protection against double jeopardy in Maryland from its state constitution, but the Court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and so made it enforceable against the states. As a result, the Court overturned the larceny conviction. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the majority, wrote:   "It is clear that petitioner's larceny conviction cannot stand once federal double jeopardy standards are applied. Petitioner was acquitted of larceny in his first trial. Because he decided to appeal his burglary conviction, he is forced to suffer retrial on the larceny count as well. As this Court held in Green v. United States ... 'conditioning an appeal of one offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy.'"

Boys' Latin School of Maryland       Boys' Latin School of Maryland is an all-boys, college-preparatory school located in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1844, it is the oldest independent, non-sectarian secondary school in the state of Maryland. The school is divided into Lower, Middle and Upper Schools. There are approximately 640 students in kindergarten through twelfth grades.  HistoryBoys' Latin was founded in 1844 by Evert Marsh Topping, a former classics professor from Princeton University. The school was located in a downtown housing project (on Brevard Street) until the late 1950s, when its site was selected as part of a city-sponsored urban renewal project. The school relocated to its present   campus spanning Lake Avenue, on the border between Baltimore City and Baltimore County, in Roland Park, Baltimore. AcademicsThe faculty has an average of 13 years of teaching experience and 60% hold advanced degrees. With a student to faculty ratio of 8:1, class sizes are small and offer many opportunities for individual interaction with the teacher and for student-centered activities. In addition to the care and instruction of classroom teachers, students in the Middle and Upper Schools are assigned to faculty advisers who monitor their academic and social development. Skills are woven throughout the curriculum. Educational Support Services (ESS) provides learning and teaching support in all divisions.The Lower School begins with Kindergarten classes where students are first exposed to the Wilson Foundation system of language teaching. In addition to classes with their homeroom teacher in reading, the language arts, social sciences, and math, students have classes with specialized teachers for the beginning of their education in music, art, Spanish, music, science, technology, and physical education.The Middle School offers traditional classes such as algebra, life sciences, and English, but there are also classes in life-skills such as decision making, desktop publishing, research, and independent reading. Students begin a formal, daily study of foreign language in the seventh grade with Latin. In the eighth grade students may elect to continue with the study of Latin or study Spanish or French. The eighth grade also presents an opportunity for students to develop public speaking skills: a formally prepared speech is part of their curriculum.As a college preparatory school, the Upper School has a graduation requirement of several credits in English, math, history, science, and foreign languages to ensure that students are thoroughly prepared for the independent study required in college.  Additionally, students are required to take courses in physical education and health, and the fine arts. There are also a wide variety of electives, and Advanced Placement (AP) courses are offered in thirteen subjects including calculus, statistics, physics, chemistry, biology, U.S. history, and English literature. The Williams Scholars Program provides incentives for academic achievement, including a stipend for summer educational programs.There are a multitude of opportunities in the fine and performing arts from music composition classes, to the production of music videos, painting, and building works of art. Private instrumental music lessons are available K-12, and music and art shows throughout the year showcase student achievements. The Upper School presents drama productions in the winter and spring, and each year a senior is chosen to direct the spring production. After working through a multi-draft writing process and attending several coaching sessions on presenting skills, all seniors are required to deliver a senior speech to the entire upper school. Finally, there is a wealth of club and co-curricular activities from chess clubs and mock trial teams to digital photography and student newspaper publications for all students to develop their interests. AthleticsBoys' Latin's sports teams are known as the Lakers. Boys' Latin is known for its lacrosse program; the Lakers play in the MIAA "A" Conference, one of the most competitive high school lacrosse leagues in the nation. They have won many conference championships and have sent many players to play in college at all levels. They have currently 27 Division 1 players. In 2006, the Lakers completed an undefeated 21-0 championship season and were named the #1 high school lacrosse team in the United States,   an honor the school also accomplished in 1985, 1988, and 1997.

Maryland Music Educators Association The Maryland Music Educators Association (MMEA), recently known for excluding homeschoolers who play in homeschool ensembles from its activities, is the Maryland state-level affiliate of MENC: The National Association for Music Education.  MMEA is a professional association for school music educators in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The mission of the Maryland Music Educators Association is to provide enriched musical opportunities for students, encourage student participation in music, and improve the quality of music instruction. MMEA provides student and teacher enrichment by sponsoring numerous student activities. The association has 8 annual All State music groups (Senior Band, Senior Mixed Chorus, Senior Women's Chorus, Senior Jazz Band, Senior Orchestra, Junior Band, Junior Chorus and Junior Orchestra) which are drawn from the entire state. A rigorous audition process selects about 920 students from the 6,000 to 7,000 students in secondary school music programs who audition for the groups. The student musicians spend several weeks in individual preparation and then come together for a three day intense rehearsals with a nationally known conductor. The sessions are open for teacher observation. The Association sponsors district and state Solo and Ensemble events, at which students play prepared, graded selections for an adjudicator, giving them feedback on their performance as soloists or as members of small ensembles. Those who qualify at a district event by earning the highest rating may go on the State event. This spring, the State Solo and Ensemble events heard performances from nearly 6,000 students. MMEA serves its members by providing in-service activities for music teachers at a Fall In-Service Day and at a two-day conference in February. Nationally, regionally and locally recognized clinicians provide sessions that focus on every level of the profession—early childhood through university level instruction, including special learners and at all content areas—band, chorus, general, orchestra, theory, history, technology, and world music. The secondary music performance curriculum of each district is assessed at the district level of all school systems. Using a graded list of literature, each school band, chorus and orchestra in the state is adjudicated by a panel of three performance adjudicators as well as a sight-reading adjudicator. Ensembles that qualify through the district events are invited to the State Band, Choral and Orchestra Festivals. During the spring, Orchestras, Bands and Choruses performed in these festivals, with nearly 10,000 students participating. Current Controversy Recently, MMEA has been criticized for its student eligibility policy which excludes homeschoolers who participate in band from their state-wide activities.  Many other states, including its Pennsylvania and Virginia  neighbors, include homeschoolers. External links  MMEA homepage        
Centennial High School (Howard County, Maryland)  Centennial High School is a secondary school in Ellicott City, Maryland that opened in 1977. The school is based in Howard County and is part of the Howard County Public Schools system. Starting with the 2009 school year, the school principal is Carl Perkins. A previous principal was Lynda Mitic, who took up the post in 1996 and retired in 2004, shortly before a civil rights lawsuit was brought by English teacher Michelle Maupin, claiming racial discrimination. Maupin was awarded damages in 2007 but the school system planned to appeal. In 1984-85, the school was recognized as one of the top 100 high schools in the country through the USDE Secondary School Recognition Program.   In 1996, Centennial High School was the first high school within the state of Maryland to achieve the excellence standard in all categories of the MSPAP's report card. The school maintained these standards throughout 2000 and 2001. In 2008, the school was nominated by US News & World Report as a "silver medal" school, placing in the top 505 high schools nationwide.  In a 2012 joint study by Newsweek and The Daily Beast, Centennial was ranked the #2 best public high school in Maryland and #111 in the nation.  The school has a maximum capacity of 1,332 students, but through the addition of four portable classrooms currently (as of 2007) enrolls over 1,473 students.  Of those in attendance, 62.9% are White, 26.6% are Asian, 7.6% are African American, 2.5% are Hispanic, 0.1% are Native American, and 0.3% are unidentified.  The high school dropout rate is 0.81%.

Maryland Route 190   Maryland Route 190, locally known as River Road, is a major state highway through southern Montgomery County, Maryland, United States.   Route descriptionMD 190 begins at MD 112's western terminus in Seneca, and ends at the Montgomery County / Washington, D.C. border. Inside the District of Columbia, River Road continues without designation to Wisconsin Avenue (the District extension of MD 355.The route is named River Road makes sense–it parallels the Potomac River for most of its course, although the name extends past where MD 190 actually terminates in both directions. MD 190 goes through a few populated areas such as Potomac, Maryland and other suburban areas near DC. It intersects with the Capital Beltway and the Cabin John Parkway about halfway between Potomac Village and DC, at exit 39 on the Beltway. Traffic from Interstate 270 traveling towards Washington is directed to use MD 190 as a preferred route between the outer suburbs and the District.MD 190 possesses a large number of parks along its route, including the C&O Canal National Historical Park, McKee-Beshers Wildlife Management Area, and Blockhouse Point Conservation Park, among others. 2008 water main breakOn Tuesday, December 23, 2008, during the morning rush hour, a   water main ruptured along MD 190 near its intersection with Bradley Blvd., causing a major flood along the roadway.  Many vehicles were trapped in the water, and a number of individuals had to be rescued by boat or helicopter.

Lt. Governor of Maryland 
West Baltimore, Maryland 
Benjamin Edwards (Maryland)     Benjamin Edwards (August 12, 1753 – November 13, 1829) was an American merchant and political leader from Montgomery County, Maryland. He represented the third district of Maryland for a very short time in the United States House of Representatives in 1795 after Uriah Forrest resigned.Benjamin's son, Ninian Edwards, would later serve as Governor and U.S. Senator for Illinois.

John Archer (Maryland)    John Archer (May 5, 1741 – September 28, 1810) was a U.S. Congressman from Maryland, representing the sixth district for three terms from 1801–1807.  His son, Stevenson Archer and grandson Stevenson Archer II were also Congressmen from Maryland.Archer was born near Churchville, Maryland, and attended the West Nottingham Academy in Cecil County, Maryland, later graduating from Princeton College in 1760.  He studied theology, but owing to a throat affection, he abandoned his studies in that area and began the study of medicine.  He graduated as a physician from the College of Philadelphia in 1768, receiving the first medical diploma issued on the American continent.In 1769, Archer commenced the practice of law in Harford County, Maryland.  He was a member of the Revolutionary committee from 1774 to 1776, and later raised a military company during the American Revolutionary War.  He was a member of the first state constitutional convention of 1776, and served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1777 to 1779. During the Revolutionary War, Archer was volunteer aide-de-camp to General Anthony Wayne at Stony Point. On June 1, 1779, Archer was made a captain and subsequently a major in the Continental Army.Archer was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1801 until March 3, 1807.  He founded, with his son Thomas Archer, the medical and chirurgical faculty of Maryland in 1799. In 1810, Archer documented a case of superfecundation, more specifically called "heteropaternal superfecundation," in which a Caucasian woman gave birth to mixed twins — one Caucasian, one Afro-Caucasian - after having had intercourse with two men of differing race within a few weeks. Archer died at his country home, Medical Hall, near Churchville, Maryland, and is interred in the Presbyterian Cemetery of Churchville.

McCulloch vs. Maryland 
Woodbine, Maryland   Woodbine is located in Howard and Carroll counties, in the Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area. The community was named for the plant, which grew in this town in fields and along riverbanks. BackgroundWoodbine is located at the juncture of the Patapsco River, the B&O Railroad, and the road that runs north from Lisbon to Winfield, Maryland on Liberty Road (Maryland Route 26) and through to Westminster, Maryland. The original road from Baltimore to Frederick runs just north of Lisbon, following a slight ridge line westward half way to Woodbine (the road was finally paved in the 1960s). This was the original trail that existed before the National Road was built (the road that runs through Lisbon). HistoryDuring the Civil War, Confederate cavalry crossed the Patapsco River at Woodbine and at Hoods Mill, just a few miles Eastward on the river and the B&O Railroad scouting the Union Army that was on its way to the Battle of Gettysburg. The main road at that time ran just West of the existing road and up the West side of a creek that runs south and that joins with the Patapsco River just 50 yards West of the existing road. That original road, now partly unused runs north 100 yards from the river and then Eastward (Gum Road)to join up with the existing road today. There was no bridge across the Patapsco River at that time, just a ford in the river.The town straddles the Patapsco River both North (into Carroll County) and South (into Howard County). In the 1920s and 1930s the town had a large canning factory on the Carroll County side of the river . There was another small canning factory, from the turn of the century, run by water power West of Woodbine at the foot of New Port Hill. Remains of the factory still exist and the sluice where water (from Gillis Falls Run) came to run the machinery is still visible in the wooded area below New Port Hill leading north to the dam, no longer existing.Just North 300 yards up the hill and West of the existing road (SR 94) on John Pickett Road was a wormseed distillery, where wormseed oil was steam-distilled during the 1930s and 1940s; this small factory was later converted into a tomato and corn canning factory in the late 40s.

James Thomas (Governor of Maryland)   James Thomas (March 11, 1785 December 25, 1845) served as the 23rd Governor of the state of Maryland in the United States from 1833 to 1836. He practiced medicine and served as judge in several courts throughout Maryland, and served in the Maryland State Senate from 1824–1830. BiographyHe was born at "De la Brooke Manor," in St. Mary's County, Maryland on March 11, 1785, the son of William Thomas and Catherine Boarman. He entered St. John’s College with the class of 1800, but he did not graduate.  He graduated from Charlotte Hall Military Academy in 1804. He studied medicine in Philadelphia and receiving his doctor’s degree there in 1807.  In 1808, he married his cousin, Elizabeth Coates.   He practiced medicine in St. Mary's County until the outbreak of the War of 1812. Thomas also served as a justice of the peace and, from 1810 to 1812, was a member of the Levy Court of St. Mary’s County. He was commissioned as major in the Fourth Maryland Cavalry and later brevetted a major general. After the war, Thomas resumed his medical practice, but soon entered politics. He served as a Maryland State Senator from the Western Shore from 1826 to 1831.  He was elected governor by an overwhelming majority in 1833, the last anti-Jacksonian candidate to be chosen before that party became the Whigs. Thomas was sworn into office on January 17, 1833. He was instrumental in bringing about a settlement between the interests of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad which meant so much to the success of the railroad.  He supported appropriations for the support of general education. During his term occurred the removal of the government deposits which preceded the failure of the Bank of Maryland during 1834.  Beginning on August 6, 1835, a mob began several days of rioting, burning and looting. After several days of anarchy, the Governor called for federal troops whose arrival, together with drastic action by General Samuel Smith, brought an end to several days of chaos. This incident prompted Governor Thomas to take measures for the establishment of a state militia organization. When his term expired on January 14, 1836, he retired to his home at "Deep Falls," St. Mary’s County. He died there on Christmas Day 1845, and was buried in the Thomas’ family cemetery at "Deep Falls."  References                        
John F. Kennedy High School (Silver Spring, Maryland)  John F. Kennedy High School is a public high school located in unincorporated Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Maryland.The school is a part of Montgomery County Public Schools.Over 1,550 students are enrolled at Kennedy. Since the 2004-2005 school year Kennedy has been part of the Down County Consortium, which includes Montgomery Blair, Wheaton, Einstein, and Northwood High Schools.  Kennedy's mascot is the Cavalier.Kennedy has several middle schools which feed into it as it is part of a consortium although there are two middle schools assigned specifically to Kennedy; Col. E. Brooke Lee Middle School, and Argyle Middle School. History Opening its doors in 1964, The school was originally going to be called "East Wheaton High School" but due to President John F. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 the school took his name as its namesake. Kennedy's early history is that of an experimental school, with open classes, no grades, and no required attendance. The onus was on Kennedy's students to be self-motivated. Kennedy's rare approach to education gained international attention, but ultimately these trends did not become very popular in other schools. Kennedy itself ceased to use this format as many parents refused to send their children to Kennedy. After the baby boom generation, many schools were forced to close. Kennedy absorbed the student bodies of Northwood High School. Their feeder schools were absorbed by Col. E. Brooke Lee Middle School.  The Kennedy building was renovated in the 1997-98 school year.  During that time, Kennedy's students attended classes at the then defunct Northwood High School. In 2004 Northwood was reopened, absorbing parts of Kennedy's student body through a new choice process. Student diversityKennedy is 39.5% African American, less than 5% Native American, 10.0% Asian, 42.5% Hispanic, and 5.6% White. This information is publicly available by Montgomery County Public Schools.   has five academies: The Leadership Training Institute (LTI), Tri-M (Academy of Sports Medicine, Management, and Medical Careers), Cambridge, The Junior Navy ROTC, and Mediacom. Students are required to be a member of one of these four academies to attend Kennedy. LTI is in its 10th year, Tri-M was inducted along with the class of 06, and Cambridge and Mediacom both came along with the class of '08. Although, starting in the 2008-2009 school year, the Cambridge academy will become an IB program. Kennedy also has an NJROTC program. Kennedy High School offers over 15 Advanced Placement courses, ranging from Studio Art to World History.    The school also performed SAT (477 verbal, 493 math, 969 total) and requires 75 hours of community service for graduation.    The school sent 89% of its 2005 graduating class to two- and four-year universities.In 2006, John F. Kennedy High School was listed in the Newsweek Magazines top 1200 High Schools in the U.S., as the 443rd highest-rated school in the country.  Academy Programs New Academy programs such as "The College Institute" have brought students into a more productive environment. College Institute Kennedy is one of few schools in Montgomery County who offer College Institute. The program is possible through a partnership with Montgomery College who provide professors to teach courses throughout the week. Students gain college skills and earn college credits by taking college courses during the regular school day. The College Institute extends opportunities beyond AP level and students can earn up to 30 college credits while attending their high school. These credits may be applied towards a Montgomery College degree and/or be applied to any receiving school. MediaCom: Multimedia & Telecommunications The Multimedia and Telecommunications Academy, through a rigorous program of study, provides a framework to access, analyze, evaluate and create media messages in a variety of formats—from print to the Internet and beyond.

The pathways are designed to accommodate the individual learner and provide the flexibility necessary for students to pursue their personal areas of interest. Since 2007, the academy is no longer offered. International BaccalaureateAfter the 2011 Graduating Class the Cambridge Program will phase out to become an IB program.The International Baccalaureate Academy is a small learning community that provides highly motivated students an opportunity to pursue a rigorous, comprehensive curriculum based on a global perspective. The academy, within its nurturing environment, offers an internationally recognized course of study that is designed to prepare students for the university experience.

Recent history  Reemergence of footballIn the 2006 fall season the Kennedy football team came in with a 25 game losing streak. With a new head coach, former arena league and NFL receiver Gunnard Twyner, and the emergence of star athlete Melvin Harris the Cavaliers broke their losing streak by winning their first game of the season against Albert Einstein High School. The Cavaliers exceeded expectations by winning 10 games and making the playoffs. Kennedy managed to avenge their 49-7 loss from earlier in the season by beating the state powerhouse Seneca Valley Screamin' Eagles 19-7, the teams first playoff win since 1992. The team entered the second round of the playoffs against Urbana High School, but came up short.However since that season the Kennedy football team has fallen back into their losing ways. The team is currently ranked one of the worst in the county. BaseballWhen the graduating class of 2008 arrived at Kennedy H.S. in 2004, it was easy to recognize that this would be one of the best athletic group of student-athletes the school would ever have. Though not easily noticeable, improvements were taking place little by little in all of Kennedy's sports seasons. Not many records improved, but much respect was gained. The 2005 baseball season for the Cavs concluded in the ending of a 5-year losing streak, with a come-from-behind win against Albert Einstein H.S. Jack Chizik, coach at the time, and the team would have something to be proud of and build on. The following year, some experienced sophomores who played on the varsity team the year before returned to the field once again, looking to keep improving and make Kennedy's varsity baseball program a well-respected one. And so they did, finishing the season with a 2-14 record, and losing some close games to tough teams not to mention an 8-3 win against powerhouse Paint Branch H.S. A big role was played by new coach and former Southern University MVP Mike Maroto, who came from Atlanta, Georgia, after having coached a team that constantly made the state championships. Maroto had a rough transition to make, but in his first year, a huge improvement showed. In 2007, the team was mainly made up of '07 and '08. The players formed close bonds and, yet again, doubled their win total from the year before, to a record of 4-12. Perhaps the biggest and most noticeable improvement came in the 2008 baseball season. With many position players missing due to graduation in 2007, the Cavs felt they were not in a good position. Nevertheless, Coach Maroto stayed positive and led an offseason workout program in which prominent role players improved not only physically, but mentally, and skillfully. After dropping the first game, the Cavs came back to win the next four in a row. Due to the efforts and hard work of the team, and coaches (Maroto and Watts), the Cavs finished the season with an 8-8 record. Prominent role players included senior catcher Tony Staffa, Senior shortstop Elio Peraza, Senior pitcher/first baseman Michael Sullivan, and Senior center fielder Noah Walker. The Cavs had their best season in decades, along with Staffa making the County All-Star team. LacrosseAlthough on a recent downward trend since the departure of Coach David Heiney-Gonzalez, the Cavaliers lacrosse team is known throughout Montgomery County as a powerhouse contender.  Former Coach Gonzalez was instrumental in converting football athletes to emerging lacrosse players.  Although they lacked strong stick skills, due to pure athleticism and coaching, the team was able to compete with established lacrosse teams including Springbrook, Wooton and Sherwood High School.  Previous notable players include Munachimso Okoji, Sanoussy Barry, Prashant Rao and Thomas "Teddy" Wescott that showed strong potential under Coach Gonzalez's training.  During the 2006-2007 season the Rockville-Kennedy rivalry reached an all-time high with players, coaches and even parents trash-talking over the popular internet website Facebook.  This almost spilled over, with several students threatening others but fortunately no incidents occurred.  The teams played each other during the 2006-2007 season and both times Rockville won.  Since then the rivalry has subsided, but Rockville-Kennedy lacrosse games still fill the stands. Athletic Rivalries Kennedy's main rival is Wheaton High School which is located down Randolph Road.  The Rivalry is fueled by the schools close proximity to one another.    The Wheaton-Kennedy Rivalry is one of the oldest rivalries in Montgomery County.  Other smaller rivalries include those with Albert Einstein High School and for Lacrosse; Rockville High School (Maryland). Facilities Kennedy's Football stadium is named in memory of Brady Straub, who coached the 1984 football team to the state championship.  The following year, he bravely led the team while battling cancer, succumbing shortly after the end of the season. The field was redone in the spring of 2007 after being condemned by the county for poor conditions. The gymnasium hallway bears the last name of former Kennedy all-star basketball player and captain Jeremy Herring. Herring, who was the lead scorer for Montgomery County in 2007, was slain along with his brother Justin Herring (also an alumni) in the summer following his graduation.

Maryland's 8th congressional district    Maryland's 8th congressional district stretches from the northern Washington, D.C. suburbs  north to the Pennsylvania border.  The district is currently represented by Democrat Chris Van Hollen.  History The district was created after the 1790 census in time for the 1792 election, was abolished after the 1830 census, and was reinstated after the 1960 census.  During Carlton R. Sickles's tenure, the district was at-large and covered the entire state.During redistricting after the 2000 census, the Democratic-dominated Maryland legislature sought to unseat then-incumbent Republican Connie Morella .  One proposal went so far as to divide the district in two, effectively giving one to state Senator Christopher Van Hollen, Jr. and forcing then-incumbent Connie Morella to run against popular Maryland State Delegate and Kennedy political family member Mark Kennedy Shriver .  The final redistricting plan was less ambitious, restoring an eastern, heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County removed in the 1990 redistricting to the 8th District , as well as adding an adjacent portion from heavily Democratic Prince George's County located in   . Although it forced Van Hollen and Shriver to run against each other in an expensive primary, the shift pushed the district into the Democratic column, and Van Hollen defeated Morella in 2002.From 2003 to 2013 the district mostly consisted of the larger part of Montgomery County, also including a small portion of Prince George's County.

Delaware-Maryland Synod   The Delaware-Maryland Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is the geographical synod consisting of the entire state of Delaware and most of the state of Maryland, with the exception of the counties surrounding Washington, D.C., and extreme western Maryland.With its office in suburban Baltimore, Maryland, the synod encompasses two states with totally different histories; Maryland, a primarily Roman Catholic colony, and Delaware, originally part of Pennsylvania and primarily Quaker and Methodist. Both states supplied militia in the American Revolution and as so-called border states in the American Civil War, were allowed to keep slaves, while fighting alongside of Union forces.  Both states ended segregation in the 1950s, ironic for residents of Wilmington, Delaware who lived just 30 miles from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who had no slaves or segregation policies since the signing of the U.S. Constitution.The synod corresponds to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore, the oldest Catholic metropolitan in the U.S., as well as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington, the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware, and the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland.

Maryland's 2nd congressional district  Maryland's 2nd congressional district elects a representative to the United States House of Representatives every two years.  The district comprises parts of Howard, Harford, Baltimore, and Anne Arundel Counties, as well as small portions of the City of Baltimore. The seat is currently represented by Dutch Ruppersberger (D).  Historical boundariesWhen it was first organized in the late 1780s the Maryland 2nd Congressional district consisted of the northern portion of the eastern shore of Maryland and the area where the Susquehanna River empties in to the Chesapeake Bay.  It had a population of 55,008 in 1790. After the 1790 census Maryland gained two seats in the house.  The new 2nd district essentially consisted of Howard County, Prince George's County and Anne Arundel County.  The boundary ran on a line heading north-east from the north-west corner of the District of Columbia so that a small portion of Montgomery County was also in the 2nd district. This remained the boundaries of the district until the post-1830 census redistricting.  At this time the 2nd district was moved back to the eastern shore region where it had been at first.  The only change between the district's boundaries in 1790 and those in 1834 was that in the latter year Caroline County was part of the 2nd district. In the 1842 redistricting, which involved a decrease in the total number of representatives, Maryland went back to having only six members of the house.  The second district was moved again and now composed the Maryland Panhandle, that is all of Maryland starting with Frederick County and going west. The post-1850 census redistricting caused another drastic redrawing of Maryland's  congressional districts.  The second district was moved back to the East side of the state.  However this time it only had the eastern shore as far south as Kent County.  However going westward it had Harford County, northern and western Baltimore County and the western and most southernly portions of Baltimore.  It also took in Carroll County. In the 1862 redistricting process Maryland was reduced to having only five congressional districts.  The second was cut down in size though to only having Harford County, eastern and northern Baltimore County including some areas now within the city boundaries on Baltimore. In the 1872 redistricting Maryland rose to six districts.  However the area of the 2nd district increased.  This was partly because it lost some of its area on the east side of Baltimore to the third district.  It now also consisted of virtually all of Baltimore county, and the northern reaches of Baltimore.  Cecil County was returned to its area, but Kent County remained in the first district.  Carroll County was also put back in the second district.  Thus the second district in 1873 was closer to that of 1853 than of 1871 in terms of the area within its boundaries. In 1890 there was a small portion of the city of Baltimore that was moved from the 4th district and placed in the 7th district.  It appears this was in the general area where Freemont meets Fulton and then a little further south along Freemont.   These boundaries remained until the 1898 elections.  In that year a few more north-west Baltimore neighborhoods were transferred from the 4th to the 2nd district, as well as a few north-central Baltimore neighborhoods. In 1902 another change was done to congressional district boundaries in Maryland.  With the northward growth of population in Baltimore the 4th and 3rd districts boundaries were moved into areas previously in the 2nd district.  however areas in north-west Baltimore that were closer to down-town were shifted into the 2nd district.  Cecil County was moved to the first district.  The arm of Baltimore County around Arbutus had long been in the 5th District but at this point it was transferred into the 2nd district.  These remained the boundaries of the 2nd district for the next 50 years.In 1952 Maryland redrew its congressional districts because it had gained another seat in Congress.  The 2nd district lost all of its area within the city of Baltimore, so it now consisted of Baltimore, Carroll and Harford Counties. In 1966 Maryland redrew its congressional districts to follow the rule of "One man, one vote".   This was especially necessary since the state had been electing one of its congressmen at large in the previous two elections.  A portion of Baltimore County along Baltimore's north-east border was removed from the 2nd district.  The Arbutus section of Baltimore county was also removed from the district along with a slightly further north portion of the county reaching to about Garrison.  Most of Carroll County was moved to the Maryland panhandle based 6th district. In 1972 Harford County was moved to the First District.  The remaining portion of Carroll County was moved to the 6th district.  However the Garrison area of Baltimore County, all of Baltimore county east of Baltimore and even a very small part of Baltimore itself were moved back into the second district. In 1982 some of the areas that had been in the 2nd district just north and west of Baltimore were moved into the Maryland Congressional 3rd District.  Also at this time a part of Harford County was moved back into the 2nd congressional district. In 2012 the district was found to be the eleventh least compact congressional district in the United States.

Maryland's 6th congressional district  Maryland's 6th congressional district elects a representative to the United States House of Representatives from the northwest part of the state. Today the district comprises all of Garrett, Allegany, and Washington counties as well as portions of Montgomery and Frederick counties. The seat is currently represented by John Delaney (D).  HistoryThe Maryland 6th District was one of the original districts that had a congressman starting in 1789.  At that time, the district essentially had what remains its modern boundaries, consisting of the Maryland panhandle and areas eastward, all the way to the modern western boundary of the District of Columbia. However after the 1790 census Maryland's representation increased to 8 congresspersons.  The new sixth district was in the north-east corner of the state east of Baltimore, covering essentially the modern counties of Harford, Cecil and Kent.

Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission   Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission    Logo   Location    General Information  Established 1927  Number of Counties 2  Area (approx.) 1,005 sq. mi.  Population   1.67 Million (2000)   1.84 Million (2010)  The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC) is a bi-county agency that administers parks and planning in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland. HistoryThe Commission was formed in 1927 by the Maryland General Assembly.  Since 1970, the Commission also has operated the Prince George's County recreation program, funded by a separate countywide recreation tax. In addition, the Commission provides services and educational programs relating to conservation and nature, local history, and the arts, and offers recreation classes. Organization and FunctionsThe Commission is divided into four departments: Montgomery Department of Parks, Montgomery Planning Department, Prince George's Department of Parks & Recreation, and Prince George's Planning Department. While these counties and departments are all within One Commission, day-to-day operations, for the most part, are separate. Interaction among general staff across counties and departments is rare. ParksThe Commission manages over   of parks in the two counties. Within the Maryland-Washington Metropolitan District, the Commission is empowered to acquire, develop, maintain, and operate parks systems. In all areas except Laurel, the Commission may spend public funds to acquire park land. Subject to county government approval, it also may sell general obligation bonds to fund park acquisition and development. All other expenses, including debt service, are paid from a park tax levied within the District.Prince George's Stadium in Bowie is built on park property.  PlanningTaking into account all factors of urban, suburban, rural and regional planning, the Commission prepares and administers a General Plan for the physical development of the Maryland-Washington Regional District. All of Prince George's County (except Laurel) and all of Montgomery County (except Rockville, Gaithersburg, and several small municipalities) are included in the district. For the portion of the District within their county, each planning board makes zoning recommendations to its county council. To enact zoning ordinances and change the zoning map, the planning boards have exclusive responsibility for subdivision approval, location and grades of streets, location of public buildings and utilities, and street naming and house numbering. Administration and operating expenses of the Commission are financed by property taxes levied by the two counties. Park PoliceThe Commission supervises the Maryland-National Capital Park Police, which patrols the parks in both counties. The M-NCPPC Park Police is divided into the Montgomery County Division and the Prince George's County Division. GovernanceThe Commission's ten members include five residents of Montgomery County and five of Prince George's who serve four-year terms. The five members from each county make up the county planning board. In Montgomery County, members are appointed by the County Council and confirmed by the County Executive. In Prince George's County, the County Executive appoints all five members subject to County Council confirmation. Of the members from each county, no more than three may be of the same political party. The appointing authority names the planning board chair. The Commission chair alternates each year between the two planning board chairs (Françoise Carrier, Elizabeth M. Hewlett). The alternate becomes vice-chair.The Commission appoints the Executive Director (Patricia Barney), General Counsel (Adrian Gardner), and Secretary-Treasurer (Joe Zimmerman). In Prince George's County, the Parks and Recreation Director and Planning Director are appointed by the County Planning Board. In Montgomery County, the Planning Board appoints a Director of Parks (Mary Bradford) and a Planning Director (Rose Krasnow, acting).

Purple Line (Maryland)  The Purple Line, previously designated as the Bi-County Transitway, is a proposed 16-mile (25 km) transit line to link the Red, Green, and Orange lines of the Washington Metro transportation system in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. Purple Line Overview MTA Maryland website. Retrieved 2010-1-7  The project is currently being administered by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA). On October 7, 2011 the proposed light rail line received Federal Transit Administration approval to enter the detailed engineering phase which, according to the Washington Post, is "a significant step forward in its decades-long trek toward construction."  History The Purple Line was conceived as a rail line from New Carrollton to Silver Spring. Maryland's Glendening administration (which included John Porcari as Secretary of Transportation) removed the heavy rail option from planning discussion because it was felt that the cost was greater than the need.Robert Flanagan, the Maryland State Secretary of Transportation under Governor Robert Ehrlich, merged the Purple Line with another transportation project, Georgetown Branch Light Rail Transit (GBLRT). The GBLRT was proposed as a light rail transit line from Silver Spring westward, following the former Georgetown Branch of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now a short CSX siding and the Capital Crescent Trail) to Bethesda. Both Governor Ehrlich and Secretary Flanagan introduced an alternative mode – bus rapid transit — that might have been  utilized in lieu of light rail transit. To reflect this possibility, the administration changed the name of the project to the "Bi-County Transitway" in March 2003. Another reason that "the Purple Line" was discouraged by the Ehrlich administration was that its associations with the other color-oriented names of the Washington Metro system (which consists of heavy rail) might lead the public to expect a heavy rail option. The new name did not catch on, however, as several media outlets and most citizens continued to refer to the project as the Purple Line. As a result, Governor Martin O'Malley and Secretary of Transportation John Porcari opted to revert to "Purple Line" in 2007. In January 2008, the O'Malley administration allocated $100 million within a six-year capital budget to complete design documents for state approval and funding of the Purple Line.  In May 2008, it was reported that the Purple Line could carry about 68,000 daily trips. A draft environmental impact study was issued on October 20, 2008.  On December 22, 2008, Montgomery County planners endorsed building a light rail line rather than a bus line. On January 15, 2009, the county planning board also endorsed the light rail option,  and County Executive Isiah Leggett has also expressed support.  On October 21, 2009, members of the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board voted unanimously to approve the Purple Line light rail project for inclusion into the region’s Constrained Long-Range Transportation Plan. Even though the project is currently overseen by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), it is not yet clear who would operate the Purple Line if it were constructed. MTA representative Michael Madden said that the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has been working with the MTA to develop the Purple Line. The future transit system could be operated by the state of Maryland, by WMATA, or by Montgomery and Prince George's counties. Regardless, planners intend to utilize current Metrorail stations and for the Purple Line to accept WMATA's SmarTrip farecard.  Metro's 2008 annual report asks readers to imagine that in 2030 the Purple Line will be integrated with WMATA's existing transit system.   Route and station locations The planned rail or rapid bus line will connect the existing Metro, MARC commuter rail, and Amtrak stations at:   Bethesda (Metro Red Line) Silver Spring (Metro Red Line), MARC Brunswick Line College Park (Metro Green Line), MARC Camden Line New Carrollton (Metro Orange Line), MARC Penn Line, Amtrak Northeast Corridor (Northeast Regional, Vermonter)  The following stations are part of the "Locally Preferred Alternative" route approved by Governor Martin O'Malley on August 9, 2009:   Bethesda Connecticut Avenue in Chevy Chase Lyttonsville Road in Silver Spring 16th Street in Silver Spring Silver Spring Metro Center Silver Spring Library, Fenton Street Dale Drive in Silver Spring (proposed to be built after initial construction) Manchester Road in Silver Spring Arliss Street in Silver Spring Gilbert Street in Takoma Park Takoma Park-Langley Park Transit Center Riggs Road Adelphi Road in Hyattsville University of Maryland, campus center University of Maryland, east campus U.S. Route 1 in College Park River Road in Riverdale Park Kenilworth Avenue in Riverdale Park Riverdale Road in Riverdale Annapolis Road near Landover Hills New Carrollton Metro Center   Potential further expansion Although the majority of discussions about the Purple Line describe the project as a 16-mile east-west line between Bethesda and New Carrollton,    there have been several proposals to expand the line further into Maryland or to mirror the Capital Beltway as a loop around the entire Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  The Sierra Club has argued for a Purple Line which would "encircle Washington, D.C." and "connect existing suburban metro lines."   Maryland Lieutenant Governor Anthony G. Brown, while campaigning in 2006, similarly stated that he'd "like to see the Purple Line go from Bethesda to across the Woodrow Wilson Bridge," adding, "Let’s swing that boy all the way around" (a reference to having the Purple Line circle through Virginia and back to the line's point of origin in Bethesda). An advocacy group known as "The Inner Purple Line Campaign" has stated that the Purple Line could be extended westward to Tysons Corner and eastward to Largo, and that it could eventually cross the new Wilson Bridge from Suitland through Oxon Hill to Alexandria, eventually forming a rail line that encircles the city. What is the Purple Line?, The Inner Purple Line Campaign, a project of the Action Committee for Transit (ACT), retrieved 2009-12-4   The reconstruction of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge (I-495's southern crossing over the Potomac River) provides capacity for the bridge to carry a heavy or light rail line.  Suggested stops along this proposed Purple Line expansion include:   Largo Town Center Branch Avenue Oxon Hill (potentially near Rosecroft Raceway, at which Metro has at times had plans to build a stop since 1980 ) National Harbor Alexandria, potentially the King Street – Old Town Metro station Springfield Annandale Dunn Loring Tysons Corner   Community support and opposition Support for rail  Purple Line Now is an non-profit specifically dedicated to advocating for the inside the beltway light rail Purple Line from Bethesda to New Carrollton integrated with a hiker/biker trail from Bethesda to Silver Spring.  The Action Committee for Transit is a community group that supports the Purple Line.  The Washington Post advocates construction of the Purple Line light rail option.  The Montgomery County Council and Prince George's County Council voted unanimously in favor of the light rail option for the Purple Line in January 2009.   State officials (including Governor O'Malley, Dem.) are also strong Purple Line advocates. State officials say that a Purple Line, which would run primarily above ground, "would provide better east-west transit service, particularly for lower-income workers who can't afford cars."  The development firm Chevy Chase Land Co. is a strong proponent of the construction of the Purple Line. The website for the pro-Purple umbrella group Purple Line NOW! lists Edward Asher as a member of its board of directors. The Washington Post indicates that the development firm would "no doubt profit from property it owns near at least one of the proposed stations."    The Sierra Club advocates a larger-scale rail system to parallel the Capital Beltway and link all existing Metro lines at their peripheries. This environmental group advocates rail transit over car use because carbon emissions are a major risk factor for global warming.  Some student leaders (the Student Government Association and Graduate Student Government) at the University of Maryland support transit alternatives to campus.   On January 27, 2009, the Montgomery County Council voted to support the light rail option.    Governor O'Malley announced his own approval on August 4, 2009.  The vice president of trail development for the Rails to Trails conservancy has gone on record citing rail-trail combinations around the country and arguing that with proper design, the trail-purple-line combination can be "among the best in the nation."       Support for bus   A 2008 study by Sam Schwartz Engineering for the Town of Chevy Chase supported bus rapid transit using an alternate Jones Bridge Road alignment. The Chevy Chase study expressed concerns about the expected ridership numbers, carbon footprint, interruptions in recreation pathways, and the cost of bus and light rail proposals by the MTA involving a Capital Crescent Trail alignment. Although a Jones Bridge Road alignment was also proposed by the MTA, the study noted that features typical of bus rapid transit that were missing from the MTA proposal. Analysis of MTA Purple Line  Sam Schwartz Engineering, 2008-4-23, Study of BRT alternative for Town of Chevy Chase, retrieved 2009-12-1    Opposition to rail  An unincorporated local organization, Save the Trail Petition, has been collecting signatures on a petition opposing the MTA's Purple Line proposals since 2003. The organization's website explains that the MTA's light rail and bus rapid transit proposals will have significant environmental and safety impacts on the Capital Crescent Trail.  Alternatives suggested by the organization's website included the Jones Bridge Road alignment for bus rapid transit recommended by the Chevy Chase study.  Save the Trail Petition prefers alternatives, however, noting that a Jones Bridge Road alignment would also have some impact on the trail. Save the Trail Petition: Alternatives Studies of alternatives to a Capital Crescent Trail alignment, retrieved 2009-12-2  A leading opponent of the Purple Line is the Columbia Country Club, a golf course with land that occupies both sides of the planned route between Bethesda and Silver Spring.  Opponents in the Town of Chevy Chase cited the town's study of bus rapid transit alternatives. The study estimated a cost of less than $1 billion dollars for a bus rapid transit system, compared with an estimated cost of $1.8 billion for light rail.   A 2011 news report placed the cost of the rail line at  .    Some Silver Spring residents are concerned that one of the proposed routes will take houses along Thayer Avenue, cross behind East Silver Spring Elementary School, take over an acre of Sligo Creek Park, and bring noise to a residential neighborhood.  Residents around the Dale Wayne stop are concerned that doubling the size of the road, along with the county's "smart growth" policy around transit stops, will encourage commercial development in a residential neighborhood. Their concerns have also questioned whether the 1,427 daily boardings anticipated by the MTA by 2030 is a realistic figure for the Dale station.     Responses for and against light railCommon responses to opposition points, and responses in turn to them, include the following:  Pro-rail:  The Purple Line will not destroy the Capital Crescent Trail, but will exist adjacent to it.  From an environmental perspective, the environmental benefits of increased transit use, such as lower vehicle emissions, more than offset the removal of trees along the route.  The Purple Line will allow the final 1.5-mile section of the Capital Crescent Trail to be completed into Silver Spring as an off-road trail and will reduce the number of at-grade crossings.  The right-of-way for the Capital Crescent Trail was purchased by the state of Maryland specifically for a transit line, so the trail would not exist if not for the transit line.  Bus rapid transit is not as efficient (due to reduced speed and higher emissions) as light rail. Why We Support Rail for the Inner Purple Line The Inner Purple Line Campaign, a project of the Action Committee for Transit (ACT), retrieved 2009-12-4  The suggested alternate route along Jones Bridge Road between Bethesda and Silver Spring is indirect and slower than the Capital Crescent route.  Anti-rail:  The proposed routing will clear-cut thousands of mature trees and replace a linear park with a paved sidewalk adjacent to a pair of high speed rail lines. (This assertion is highly suspect, given its uncited nature and the Rails-to-Trails endorsement.)  To achieve lower carbon dioxide output when compared with cars, light rail transit vehicles may require a significantly greater number of passengers than buses. Size of vehicles, frequency of braking and acceleration, and traffic impact of rail and bus should be considered.  The Capital Crescent Trail extension into Silver Spring was part of all build alternatives in the AA/DEIS document prepared by MDOT. It was not limited to the light rail alternatives.  A right-of-way was purchased through the rails-to-trails program, and rail supporters are only proposing a small portion of the length for conversion back to rail.  There is not an obligation from law or practice to regress a trail back to rail. (Again, somewhat strongly negated by the Rails to Trails endorsement cited above.)  A rail system would make local traffic worse by reducing capacity of small suburban roads, adding more stops, and possibly car/rail collisions. A bus rapid transit system would cost 30 percent less to build, reduce overall travel time for most riders, and may also reduce overall air pollution (see pages 6–8 of the Chevy Chase Analysis of MTA Purple Line).  Use of buses would allow integration with the county or WMATA bus transit system, rather than operating as an isolated line. An alignment along Jones Bridge Road would serve more passengers than an alignment along the Capital Crescent Trail.  Speed is a function of the number of at-grade crossings, not the type of vehicle.

Joppa, Maryland Joppa, Maryland in Harford County, Maryland is now a planning region for the county, but there was originally a town at the center called Joppa.  Joppa was founded as a British colonial settlement in the early 18th century, and takes its name from the biblical town of Joppa (Jaffa, Israel).The town of Joppa on the Gunpowder River traded internationally in agricultural products, especially tobacco.  At its peak, the port was home to about 50 homes, a church, prison, inns, shops, schools, armament factories, and warehouses. However, with the rise of Baltimore and Annapolis, Joppa declined as a port, and was slowly abandoned.  By 1815, all that remained were ruins, and the surviving Rumsey Mansion.In 1962, Joppatowne, one of the first of a new generation of planned unit developments (PUD) in the United States, was launched by the Panitz Company.McComas Institute was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

St. Mary's High School (Annapolis, Maryland)   St. Mary's High School is a small, co-educations college-preparatory Catholic high school located in the heart of Annapolis, Maryland.   It is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore.  St. Mary's is accredited by  AdvancED, the Archdiocese of Baltimore and is recognized and approved by the Maryland State Department of Education.  St. Mary's annually participates in a lacrosse game versus Severn School called Battle Lax.  Their football rivalry game is called The Severn River Classic, and the two schools are traditional arch-rivals.  St. Mary's is known for its excellence in academics, and offers several AP and Honors classes. History  Campus features The school is located in downtown Annapolis, on Duke of Gloucester Street.  It is connected by hallways with St. Mary's Elementary School, and shares its grounds with St. Mary's Church as well as the Charles Carroll House.  Originally, the School Sisters of Notre Dame maintained a convent on the property as well, but that building has since been transformed primarily into a library and computer labs.  Classrooms and hallways are based on a traditional corridor basis (A, B and C), with lockers located in each along the walls.  The gymnasium is also located on campus, and is named after C. Mason "Daffy" Russell, a longtime coach at St. Mary's.Being located in a tight, urban area, surrounded by historic properties, the school does not have athletic fields of its own on campus.  Historically, the school has utilized practice facilities at Bates Elementary School and Germantown Elementary School for practices, and has used various sites in the area for home games.  In 2007, St. Mary's finally gained its own home field by building the St. Mary's Field at St. John Neumann Church on Bestgate Road, approximately two miles from campus. Organization The school has an advisory School Board which offers recommendations to the pastor and school administrations concerning policies and fiscal responsibility.  Presently, the administration of the high school consists of the following individuals:PRINCIPAL Mr. Richard A.

Maryland Route 210  Maryland Route 210 (MD 210) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Indian Head Highway, the highway runs   from Potomac Avenue in Indian Head north to the District of Columbia boundary in Forest Heights, where the highway continues into Washington as South Capitol Street. MD 210 is a four- to six-lane divided highway that connects Washington with the suburban communities of Oxon Hill, Fort Washington, and Accokeek southwestern Prince George's County and Bryans Road and Indian Head in northwestern Charles County. The highway also provides access to Fort Washington Park and Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center and, in conjunction with MD 228, connects Waldorf with Interstate 95, I-495, and I-295. MD 210 is a part of the National Highway System from MD 228 to its complex interchange with those Interstate Highways. Indian Head Highway was constructed by the U.S. federal government as a military access highway in the mid-1940s to connect Washington with the Indian Head Naval Proving Ground and Fort Washington. The previous highway between Washington and Indian Head was Livingston Road, which was traced in the late 18th century and improved in the 1920s and early 1930s as MD 224. The new highway incorporated several sections of meandering MD 224 into its straight path. Indian Head Highway was fully designated MD 210 in the mid-1950s when the road was transferred from federal to state control. MD 210 was expanded to a divided highway in Forest Heights in the late 1940s and south through Fort Washington in the 1960s. Another section of divided highway was completed through Charles County in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The final divided highway section was completed through Accokeek in the mid-1980s. MD 210 was connected with I-295 in 1989 and its interchange with I-95 and I-495 was reconstructed in the mid-2000s. The Maryland State Highway Administration has long-term plans to replace the highway's major intersections with interchanges from Oxon Hill south through Fort Washington. Route descriptionMD 210 begins at an intersection with Potomac Avenue in the town of Indian Head. Indian Head Highway continues west as a municipally maintained boulevard west to the entrance of the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center at the west end of town. MD 210 heads east as a four-lane divided highway through the eastern part of town parallel to Strauss Avenue, which splits southeast just east of Potomac Avenue. The state highway leaves the town and enters Potomac Heights, where it meets the western end of MD 225 (Hawthorne Road). MD 210 leaves the populated area and passes to the south of Chapman State Park, which contains the historic farm complex Mount Aventine. The highway reenters a suburban area in the community of Bryans Road, where the highway intersects MD 227; MD 227 heads north as Marshall Hall Road and south as Livingston Road. East of MD 227, MD 210 is paralleled by frontage roads intermittently to its northern terminus.  MD 210 enters Prince George's County and Livingston Road splits to the north and the state highway enters Accokeek. Southwest of MD 228 at Pine Drive, which is unsigned MD 810G, eight spectators of an illegal street drag race were killed in the early morning hours of February 16, 2008, by a vehicle not involved in the drag race while standing in the middle of the northbound carriageway of MD 210.  MD 210 expands to six lanes and its traffic volume doubles beyond its continuous-flow intersection with MD 228 (Berry Road). The highway intersects Livingston Road again in the center of Accokeek; that highway heads east as MD 373 and west as MD 810J before becoming a county highway. MD 210 intersects Farmington Road and curves north to cross Piscataway Creek. The state highway continues along the eastern edge of Fort Washington, where it intersects Old Fort Road and Swan Creek Road; the latter provides access to Livingston Road, which switches to the west side of the state highway. MD 210 intersects Fort Washington Road, which leads to Fort Washington Park, and Old Fort Road again east of historic Harmony Hall and St. John's Church, which are accessed from Livingston Road. Livingston Road reconnects with MD 210 at Palmer Road, north of which the state highway crosses Henson Creek.  MD 210 crosses Carey Branch and has an intersection with Kerby Hill Road and Livingston Road; the latter splits northeast toward Oxon Hill. North of Wilson Bridge Drive, MD 210 expands to eight lanes and meets the southern end of two-lane ramps from northbound MD 210 to I-295 (Anacostia Freeway) and from I-295 to southbound MD 210. The ramp to southbound MD 210 also receives traffic from northbound I-95 and I-495 (Capital Beltway) just east of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and the ramp from northbound MD 210 also provides access to the northbound Beltway and the southbound express lanes of the Beltway, which bypass the exits for I-295 and U.S. Route 1 and Virginia State Route 241 in Alexandria. North of those ramps, MD 210 continues as a four-lane divided highway and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 414 (Oxon Hill Road), which provides access to the Oxon Hill Farm and National Harbor; access from the northbound direction of the Beltway to northbound MD 210 is via MD 414.  MD 210 becomes six lanes again, crosses the quad-carriageway Beltway, and completes the Beltway access with several ramps connecting with the local lanes of the southbound Beltway. MD 210 continues north as a four-lane divided highway through the town of Forest Heights; the frontage road on the southbound side of the highway is Sachem Drive. At the north end of the residential town, the state highway meets the northern end of the northernmost Maryland segment of Livingston Road. Southbound MD 210 gains a third lane and the highway continues through a commercial area. The state highway becomes undivided just south of its terminus at the District of Columbia boundary at Southern Avenue. The highway continues northwest as South Capitol Street]] through Anacostia. Just north of the intersection, the Washington segment of Livingston Road splits to the north.   HistoryThe main highway along the Washington–Indian Head corridor before the construction of Indian Head Highway was Livingston Road, which follows much of the course of a road that has connected Charles County and the District of Columbia parallel to the eastern shore of the Potomac River through Prince George's County since the late 18th century. The road became more important as the highway connecting Washington with both Fort Washington and Fort Foote and later the Indian Head Naval Proving Ground, a gunpowder factory and testing area started by the U.S. Navy in the late 19th century.  At its southern end at Mason Springs, Livingston Road was connected to Indian Head by the La Plata–Indian Head road that later became MD 225.  At the District of Columbia boundary in what is now Forest Heights, Livingston Road continued north to Atlantic Avenue, which connected with Nichols Avenue (now Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue), which headed north to a crossing of the Anacostia River at the site of the 11th Street Bridges.   The first segment of Livingston Road in Maryland to be paved as a modern highway was from the District of Columbia boundary south to Oxon Hill Road in Oxon Hill, which was paved by Prince George's County with state aid as a macadam road by 1910.   A part of this piece of highway later became the northernmost part of Indian Head Highway.  Construction of Livingston Road as a modern highway was completed in 1933, when the highway became part of MD 224.  Other segments of Livingston Road that were reconstructed as part of Indian Head Highway were from Kerby Hill Road south to Palmer Road and from the Charles–Prince George's county line west to Bryans Road, which were both constructed as gravel roads in 1923.  The westernmost portion of Indian Head Highway in the town of Indian Head was a reconstruction of Strauss Avenue, a part of which remains as a street that splits off and parallels MD 210 through the eastern part of the town.  By 1934, MD 224 was proposed to be widened from   from Oxon Hill to Piscataway.  The need for upgrades to Livingston Road became acute by 1940 with the greatly increased activity at Fort Washington and the Indian Head Naval Powder Factory in the years before the United States entered World War II. Indian Head Highway was constructed as a highway on a new alignment in several segments during World War II. Two portions of the highway in Charles County were built by 1944: from the Strauss Avenue split east to approximately the MD 225 intersection, and from the western intersection with Chapman Landing Road to Matthews Road just east of the MD 227 intersection at Bryans Road.    No portion of Indian Head Highway was constructed between Bryans Road and Henson Creek by 1944.    A section of the highway was built between MD 224 at Kerby Hill Road south of Oxon Hill and MD 224 north of Oxon Hill in 1945.   All of Indian Head Highway from Indian Head to Washington was complete by 1946.  MD 210 was assigned to the Indian Head–Bryans Road portion of Indian Head Highway by 1949.  The designation was applied to the remainder of the highway from Charles County to the District of Columbia in 1956.  In 1955, the Maryland State Roads Commission and the Bureau of Public Roads, the predecessor to the Federal Highway Administration, signed an agreement to transfer ownership of the highway from the federal government to the state roads commission.  That same year, the Livingston Road portion of MD 224 from Mason Springs to Washington was transferred to county maintenance.  The first segment of MD 210 to be expanded to a divided highway was from the District of Columbia boundary south to Livingston Road in Forest Heights, which was expanded to a divided highway by 1950.  The highway was expanded to a divided highway from Livingston Road south to MD 414 in Oxon Hill in 1963, the year MD 210's interchange with the Capital Beltway was completed.  This junction was originally a full cloverleaf interchange; the ramp from the northbound Beltway for southbound MD 210 and from southbound MD 210 to the northbound Beltway led to and from intersections with MD 414.  MD 210 was made a divided highway from Oxon Hill south to near Fort Foote Road in 1965. The portion of MD 210 in the town of Indian Head also was expanded to a divided highway that year.  The divided highway in Charles County was extended east to Bryans Road in 1969 and completed to the county line in 1971.   MD 210 was reconstructed as a divided highway from Fort Foote Road to MD 373 in 1983.  The last segment of two-lane road on MD 210 was eliminated with expansion of the portion between MD 373 and the Charles–Prince George's county line in 1987. A pair of long S-shaped ramps were constructed from southbound I-295 to southbound MD 210 and from northbound MD 210 to both northbound I-495 and northbound I-295 in Oxon Hill in 1989.  MD 210 had been widened to a six-lane highway from MD 228 to the Capital Beltway by 1999.  MD 228 was extended west from Charles County to MD 210 as a two-lane road in 1995.  That highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in 2000; in addition, the MD 210–MD 228 junction was reconstructed as the second continuous-flow intersection in the United States.    In 2004, MD 210 achieved its present southern terminus at Potomac Avenue when the highway from there west to the military reservation gate was transferred to the town of Indian Head.  MD 210 was reconstructed in Oxon Hill starting in 2006 in work related to the construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge.  The highway's new bridges over the Capital Beltway and MD 414 and the partial cloverleaf interchange between MD 210 and MD 414 were completed in 2007.   The Maryland State Highway Administration has long-term plans to upgrade the nine signalized intersections along MD 210 between MD 228 and MD 414. The agency completed an intermodal study and received federal approval for upgrades along that corridor in 2005.  The first intersection to be upgraded will be the junction with Livingston Road and Kerby Hill Road, which will be upgraded to a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. In addition, the intersection with Wilson Bridge Drive north of Kerby Hill Road will be closed and replaced with a right-in/right-out interchange with southbound MD 210.  , engineering plans are being developed for that project.  Partial cloverleaf interchanges will also be constructed at Livingston Road and Palmer Road, and at Swan Creek Road. For the Swan Creek Road project, there will be a pair of additional ramps constructed between northbound MD 210 and Livingston Road and the continuity of the latter road will be restored. Diamond interchanges will be built at Fort Washington Road and at both intersections with Old Fort Road. Interchanges will not be constructed at Farmington Road and MD 373; instead, those intersections will be improved with lengthened and additional auxiliary lanes at each intersection.  Junction list                      Auxiliary routesMD 210 has 18 auxiliary routes, most of which are frontage roads.  MD 210A is the designation for Service Road A, a frontage road that runs   from Kerby Hill Road north to a dead end on the southbound side of MD 210 south of Oxon Hill.  MD 210B is the designation for Service Road B, a frontage road that runs   from a barrier north to a dead end north of Barrett Road on the northbound side of MD 210 between Kerby Hill Road and Palmer Road south of Oxon Hill. Access to MD 210 is via a spur near the southern end of the frontage road. The pavement continues south but there is no access to that portion of the frontage.   MD 210C is the designation for Service Road C, a frontage road that runs   from Old Fort Road south to a dead end on the southbound side of MD 210 northeast of Fort Washington.  MD 210D is the designation for Service Road D, a frontage road that runs   between dead ends on either side of Fort Washington Road on the southbound side of MD 210 northeast of Fort Washington.

MD 210J is the designation for Gospel Union Church Road, a frontage road that runs   along the southbound side of MD 210 from Shiloh Church Road in Charles County to Livingston Road in Prince George's County.   MD 210J originally only existed in Prince George's County; it was extended into Charles County in 2004.  MD 210K is the designation for Beech Lane, a frontage road that runs   from MD 810A (Livingston Road) north to a dead end south of the MD 228 junction along the northbound side of MD 210 in Accokeek. MD 210K provides access to MD 810B (Spring Grove Drive), MD 810C (Dale Lane), MD 810D (Maple Lane), and MD 810E (Pine Drive).   MD 210L is the designation for Beretta Drive, a frontage road that runs   from a dead end north to MD 810E (Pine Drive) on the southbound side of MD 210 in Accokeek.   MD 210M is the designation for the   segment of Holly Road that parallels the southbound side of MD 210 from Accokeek Landing Drive north to the intersection of Holly Road and Holly Way in Accokeek. The road continues north as Holly Way, which is MD 810F.   MD 210N is the designation for the unnamed   frontage road that runs from MD 810G (Pine Lane) to MD 810H (Manning Road West) on the southbound side of MD 210 just south of the MD 228 junction in Accokeek.   MD 210P is the designation for the unnamed   frontage road that runs from MD 373 north to a dead end beyond Jennifer Drive on the northbound side of MD 210 in Accokeek.   MD 210R is the designation for Hickory Knoll Road, a frontage road that runs   from MD 810K (Bryan Point Road) north to Whistling Oak Way and Whistling Wood Court on the southbound side of MD 210 in Accokeek.   MD 210S is the designation for the   section of Biddle Road from MD 810J (Livingston Road) north to MD 810K (Bryan Point Road) in Accokeek.   MD 210T is the designation for the unnamed   frontage road that runs from a barrier north to Farmington Road on the northbound side of MD 210 in Accokeek.   MD 210T was truncated due to the placement of the barrier at its southern terminus in 2005.  MD 210U is the designation for the unnamed   frontage road that runs from Farmington Road north to a dead end on the southbound side of MD 210 in Accokeek.   MD 210U was constructed in 2002.  MD 210V is the designation for a   service road within MD 210's interchange with the Capital Beltway. The route begins as Bald Eagle Road as the north leg of the intersection between MD 414 and that state highway's ramps with southbound MD 210. MD 210V crosses the Beltway, then turns onto the Salt Barn Access Road while Bald Eagle Road continues straight toward the Oxon Hill Farm. The route passes a salt barn before reaching its northern terminus at MD 210's intersection with the southbound exit ramp from the Capital Beltway.   The Salt Barn Access Road portion of MD 210V was constructed in 2007.  The Bald Eagle Road part of the highway was added in 2009.

Maryland Route 32  Maryland Route 32 (MD 32) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The road runs   from Interstate 97 (I-97) and MD 3 in Millersville west and north to Washington Road in Westminster. The east–west portion of MD 32 is the Patuxent Freeway, a four- to six-lane freeway between I-97 and MD 108 in Clarksville. The freeway passes through Odenton and Fort Meade, the site of Fort George G. Meade and the National Security Agency (NSA), in western Anne Arundel County and along the southern part of Columbia in Howard County. Via I-97, MD 32 connects those communities with U.S. Route 50 and US 301 in Annapolis. The state highway also intersects the four primary highways connecting Baltimore and Washington: the Baltimore–Washington Parkway, US 1, I-95, and US 29. MD 32's north–south section, Sykesville Road, connects Clarksville and Westminster by way of Sykesville and Eldersburg in southern Carroll County.  MD 32 is a part of the National Highway System from its eastern terminus in Millersville to I-70 and US 40 in West Friendship. MD 32 was constructed as the original state road from West Friendship north to Westminster and from Westminster west to Taneytown in the early 1910s. The state highway was extended northwest to the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg in the late 1910s. The portion of MD 32 from Glenelg to US 1 in Savage was built as MD 106 in the 1920s and early 1930s. MD 32 was extended south from West Friendship and assumed all of MD 106 in the mid-1940s. In the mid-1950s, the section of MD 32 from Westminster west to Emmitsburg was renumbered as an extension of MD 97. MD 32 would later be restored to its old route through Westminster and west toward Taneytown when MD 97, which is now MD 140 west of Westminster, was relocated in the early 1960s. MD 32 was truncated to Westminster in the late 1970s and rolled back to its present northern terminus in 2001.Along its present course, MD 32 bypassed Sykesville and was relocated from Clarksville to Glenelg in the early 1960s. The state highway was also extended east from Savage to Fort Meade in the late 1960s. A disjoint segment of MD 32 was constructed on a new alignment from MD 175 in Odenton to MD 178 in Crownsville in the early 1970s. The Patuxent Freeway was built from Fort Meade to Columbia in the mid-1980s and from Fort Meade to Millersville in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The freeway was completed from Columbia to Clarksville in the mid-1990s and through Fort George G. Meade in 2005. Future plans call for MD 32 to be upgraded to a freeway from Clarksville to West Friendship. Route description Millersville to Fort MeadeMD 32 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-97 and MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway) in Millersville. MD 32 starts as a pair of two-lane flyover ramps that split west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD 32 ramps head northwest while I-97 curves to the northeast and settles into the wide median of the northern end of MD 3. After passing through its interchange with MD 3, MD 32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes to the north of the community of Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound ramps of MD 32 that is unsigned MD 32AA. The eastbound ramps connect with county-maintained Burns Crossing Road. MD 32 continues northwest along the northern edge of Odenton, where the freeway gradually curves to the southwest, has a diamond interchange with MD 170 (Telegraph Road) and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 175 (Annapolis Road), and crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line between the interchanges.  MD 32 heads west from Odenton along the southern edge of Fort George G. Meade. The freeway has a dumbbell interchange with MD 198 (Laurel Fort Meade Road) just north of Tipton Airport. MD 32 curves northwest and has an interchange with Samford Road, which is one of two interchanges that provide access to the NSA. The median of MD 32 widens at the interchange as the eastbound ramps enter and exit on the left to a roundabout, from which Samford Road crosses the westbound lanes of MD 32. The freeway is maintained by the U.S. government from Samford Road to its trumpet interchange with Canine Road, which provides access to the NSA, the National Vigilance Park, and the National Cryptologic Museum. Immediately to the north of the Canine Road interchange is a cloverleaf interchange with the Baltimore–Washington Parkway.   Fort Meade to Clarksville MD 32 traverses Dorsey Run into the industrial community of Annapolis Junction, where northbound MD 32 has an interchange with Guilford Road, which leads to National Business Parkway and the historic home Grassland. The state highway crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision into Howard County and immediately has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Dorsey Run Road. Dorsey Run Road, which is unsigned MD 732R, provides access to the Savage station on MARC's Camden Line and several industrial parks in Annapolis Junction. MD 32 continues northwest into Savage, where the highway has a cloverleaf interchange with US 1 (Washington Boulevard) that includes collector-distributor lanes in both directions.  North of Savage, the freeway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95 that has a pair of left-exiting ramps from westbound MD 32 to southbound I-95 and from eastbound MD 32 to northbound I-95.  MD 32 continues west as a six-lane freeway through the expansive new town of Columbia.  The freeway passes south and north of the villages of King's Contrivance and Owen Brown, respectively, where the highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Broken Land Parkway and a four-loop interchange with Eden Brook Drive and Shaker Drive. MD 32 crosses the Little Patuxent River between the two interchanges. Just south of Simpsonville, the state highway has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike), which provides access to Columbia Town Center. The freeway reduces to four lanes and crosses the Middle Patuxent River just east of its diamond interchange with Sanner Road and Cedar Lane. MD 32 continues along the southern edge of the village of River Hill, where the highway has a half-interchange with Great Star Drive, which is unsigned MD 732V, allowing access to and from the east. The state highway continues northwest to Clarksville, where the highway has a diamond interchange with MD 108 (Clarksville Pike).   Clarksville to WestminsterWest of its interchange with MD 108, MD 32's name changes to Sykesville Road, which continues northwest as a partially controlled-access two-lane highway through a mix of farmland and large-plot residential subdivisions. The state highway is paralleled to the west by its old alignment, Ten Oaks Road. East of the community of Dayton, the state highway passes by MDSHA's Dayton shops. In Glenelg, MD 32 passes under Triadelphia Road and expands to a two-lane divided highway for its dumbbell interchange with Burnt Woods Road, which also provides access to the northern end of Ten Oaks Road and Pfefferkorn Road. The state highway becomes undivided again and veers northeast and north toward West Friendship. MD 32 crosses the Middle Patuxent River and Terrapin Branch before its intersection with MD 144 (Frederick Road), where the highway expands to a four-lane divided highway. The state highway has a diamond interchange with I-70 and US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) before reducing to a four-lane undivided highway that continues north to MD 32's intersection with MD 99 (Old Frederick Road).  MD 32 continues north as a two-lane road to Sykesville. Just south of the town, the state highway intersects West Friendship Road, the old alignment of MD 32 that is now unsigned MD 851. MD 32 veers northeast and crosses the Patapsco River and CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision into Carroll County; immediately to the east of MD 32's crossing is the highway's old aluminum bridge. The state highway passes to the west of Springfield Hospital Center, whose original buildings are preserved as the Warfield Complex, Hubner, and T Buildings. MD 32 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with Springfield Avenue, which is the northern end of MD 851, and continues north into the suburban community of Eldersburg. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway at Piney Ridge Parkway and maintains that form through its intersection with MD 26 (Liberty Road). MD 32 continues through the suburban area as a four-lane undivided highway with two lanes northbound, one lane southbound, and a center turn lane. The state highway passes to the east of Liberty High School and reduces to two lanes north of Bennett Road.  MD 32 heads into a forested area and crosses the Morgan Run arm of Liberty Reservoir. The state highway passes through an S-curve before heading through the communities of Louisville and Gamber, where the highway meets the southern end of MD 91 (Gamber Road). MD 32 continues northwest through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions toward Fenby, where the highway intersects MD 97 (New Washington Road). Just north of MD 97 adjacent to Carroll Community College, the state highway meets MD 97's old alignment, Old Washington Road, which is unsigned MD 854B. MD 32 continues north as Washington Road through a suburban area; the highway parallels MD 97 and passes to the east of the historic Friendship Valley Farm and Carroll County Almshouse and Farm, which is now the Carroll County Farm Museum. Just north of Bennett Avenue, MD 32 reaches its northern terminus at the southern city limit of Westminster. The roadway continues north as a municipal street to Main Street, which heads northwest through the Westminster Historic District.   History Original constructionWhen the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC), the predecessor of the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA), laid out its original state road system in 1909, the commission included the roads from Westminster to Taneytown and from West Friendship to Westminster via Eldersburg. These highways already contained several stretches of improved highway; Main Street in Westminster and the highways for   on either side of Gamber and for   on either side of Sykesville were paved by 1910.  In addition, the designated state roads included two turnpikes: the Westminster and Meadow Branch Turnpike operated from the western city limit of Westminster northwest to Fountain Valley on the road to Taneytown; and the Westminster and Fenby Turnpike operated from the southern city limit of Westminster to Fenby.  In 1911, the whole highway from West Friendship to Eldersburg was completed after the addition of   wide macadam sections on either side of the existing paved road through Sykesville.   That same year, construction began on the state road between Eldersburg and Fenby.  The roads from Eldersburg to the existing paved road through Gamber and from Gamber to Fenby were completed with a   wide macadam surface in 1912 and 1913, respectively. The road from Fountain Valley to Taneytown was paved as a   wide concrete road from Fountain Valley through Frizzelburg in 1914 and from there to Taneytown in 1915.  The former turnpikes still remained to be improved in 1915; those roads were resurfaced with macadam by 1919 to complete the original state road from West Friendship to Taneytown.  The next portion of what was to become MD 32 to be constructed was an extension of the Taneytown road northwest through Emmitsburg, which was planned by 1915.  The sections from Taneytown to the Monocacy River and from the river   west toward Emmitsburg were completed as a   wide concrete road by 1919.  The remaining   to Emmitsburg were underway by 1920 and built as a   wide concrete road by 1921.   The highway was completed from Emmitsburg northwest to the Pennsylvania state line by 1923.  When MDSRC started assigning numbers to its state roads in 1927, the highway from US 40 in West Friendship to the Pennsylvania state line northwest of Emmitsburg was designated MD 32. The portion of MD 32 from Glenelg to Savage was originally designated MD 106.  This highway was paved in concrete from Dayton to Clarksville and from Clarksville to about   west of the Middle Patuxent River near Simpsonville by 1923. That same year, a concrete road was added south from West Friendship to the Middle Patuxent River.  The concrete road from Clarksville was extended to the Middle Patuxent River opposite Simpsonville in 1925.   A macadam road was built from Atholton to Oakland Mills Road in Guilford between 1924 and 1926.  Guilford was connected to US 1 near Savage with a gravel road by 1927.  The gap in MD 106 through Simpsonville was filled with a concrete road in 1929 and 1930.   MD 32 was extended southwest from the Middle Patuxent River to north of Glenelg around 1933.  MD 106 was extended north from Dayton to Glenelg as a macadam road in 1934.  The gap in the highway north of Glenelg was filled by 1946, by which time MD 32 had been extended south and east over the course of MD 106 to Savage.  ImprovementsThe first major improvement to the original course of MD 32 was the replacement of the highway's one-lane covered bridge over the Monocacy River with a wider triple-span concrete arch bridge in 1925.  The highway was widened to   from Westminster to just east of Taneytown by 1930 and from Taneytown to the Pennsylvania state line by 1934.   MD 32 was reconstructed and widened again from Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line in 1948 and through Taneytown in 1949.  When US 40 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway through West Friendship in 1951, the new highway was placed on a bridge over MD 32 and a two-way ramp added to connect the grade-separated highways.  MD 32 was relocated between Eldersburg and Louisville and a new bridge was constructed over Morgan Run in 1952 to replace the old road that would have been submerged by the filling of Liberty Reservoir.   In 1956, the portion of MD 32 from Fenby north to Westminster and from Westminster west through Taneytown and Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line was renumbered MD 97, which had been extended north from Howard County. The portion of MD 32 from MD 26 in Eldersburg to MD 97 in Fenby was transferred to county maintenance at the same time.  In 1960, the road from Eldersburg to Fenby returned to the state highway system. In addition, MD 97 was moved to a new alignment, New Washington Road; the new alignment ran from Fenby to US 140, which then connected Baltimore with Gettysburg, in Westminster. MD 97 then followed the Westminster Bypass to the northwest side of the city. Subsequently, MD 32 was extended along its original alignment through Westminster to MD 97 near Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College).  MD 32 would later be assigned to its original alignment from Fountain Valley to east of Taneytown when MD 97's new alignment between the two communities was completed in 1965.  The disjoint segment of MD 32 was renumbered MD 832 in 1978.  In 1979, US 140 was decommissioned; the highways from Baltimore to Westminster and from Westminster through Emmitsburg became MD 140. MD 97 was moved to its present course from Westminster toward Gettysburg.  MD 32's northern terminus was rolled back to MD 31 around 1987.   The state highway was truncated at the Westminster city limit in 2001 following the reconstruction of Main Street and its transfer to city maintenance. MD 32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg starting in 1957 and from West Friendship to just south of Sykesville in 1958.  The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road through the center of Sykesville became MD 851.   MD 32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges. In the 1990s, MDSHA discovered the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory.  The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and aluminum girder structure.   Because repairing the structure would have been extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately to the west of the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD 32 on both sides of the bridge.   The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was left in place as a historic landmark after MD 32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.  Patuxent FreewayIn 1956, MD 32 was extended east on Guilford Road from US 1 to the Howard – Anne Arundel county line at Annapolis Junction.  The state highway was relocated to its present alignment from Glenelg to Clarksville between 1961 and 1964, bypassing Ten Oaks Road.   MD 32 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in West Friendship when its interchange with I-70 was reconstructed as a diamond interchange in 1973.  MD 32 was extended east into Anne Arundel County in 1969 when the designation was extended to just east of the Baltimore–Washington Parkway on the edge of Fort George G. Meade.  The first two sections of what would become the Patuxent Freeway opened in 1972. A short section of divided highway opened from just west of Oakland Mills Road in Guilford to a turnaround just west of Vollmerhausen Road that included MD 32's modern interchange with I-95. The other section was a two-lane road from MD 175 in Odenton northeast along Sappington Station Road and then east along the current alignments of MD 32 and I-97 to MD 178 just east of I-97 Exit 5 in Crownsville. The eastern section, which from 1972 to 1977 was one of the three disjoint sections of mainline MD 32 between Crownsville and Taneytown, included an interchange with MD 3 in Millersville.  As of 1978, MD 32's interchange with the Baltimore–Washington Parkway was a partial cloverleaf interchange with four ramps on the north side of MD 32—due to the state highway closely paralleling the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's spur to the military base—and a fifth ramp from the northbound parkway to eastbound MD 32. The MD 3 interchange included the ramps to and from MD 32 in the direction of Fort Meade plus a ramp from westbound MD 32 to northbound MD 3. All other movements were made via MD 178 or Millersville Road. Construction on the Patuxent Freeway resumed in 1981 in Howard County.   The freeway opened from Dorsey Run Road to US 29 in 1985.  The freeway was extended across the Middle Patuxent River to tie into the existing two-lane road near Cedar Lane by 1987. The new highway was extended east from Dorsey Run Road to just west of the Baltimore–Washington Parkway as a four-lane divided highway that same year. Sections of MD 32's old alignment became part of MD 732.  The highway from Dorsey Run Road to the parkway was upgraded to a freeway with the completion of interchanges at Dorsey Run Road and a ramp to Guilford Road in 1991.  The interchange between MD 32 and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway was upgraded to a full cloverleaf around 1993.  The final section of the Patuxent Freeway in Howard County opened from west of US 29 to west of MD 108 in 1996.  I-97 was under construction from Annapolis to Millersville by 1987.   When that section of the Interstate was completed in 1989, the highway took over the portion of MD 32 from MD 178 to MD 3.  The easternmost portion of MD 32 became I-97's Exit 5 interchange ramps; the MD 3 interchange was upgraded to provide full access.  Also in 1989, construction began on MD 32 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and I-97. MD 32 was extended as a four-lane divided highway along the existing road from the parkway east to MD 198 and as a two-lane road on a new alignment from MD 198 to MD 175. The sections of MD 32 from MD 198 to MD 175 west of Odenton and from Burns Crossing Road to I-97 were under construction to expand them to a freeway; the freeway segment from MD 175 to Burns Crossing Road on the north side of Odenton was also under construction.  The freeway between MD 198 and MD 175 was complete by 1991.  The remainder of the Patuxent Freeway from Fort Meade to Millersville was completed in 1993. In 2000, construction began on the gap in the Patuxent Freeway through Fort George G. Meade.   MD 32's interchanges with MD 198 and Samford Road were completed in 2002.  The MD 198 project involved extending the latter highway east along the northern edge of Tipton Airport so MD 198 could tie into the fort's Mapes Road entrance; the Mapes Road intersection east of MD 198 was also eliminated by the construction.  The Patuxent Freeway through Fort Meade was finished when MD 32's interchange with Canine Road was completed in 2005.  Sykesville Road upgradeMDSHA has long-term plans to upgrade MD 32 to a four-lane freeway from MD 108 to I-70. The first project, which involved constructing a modified dumbbell interchange to connect MD 32 with Burnt Woods Road, Ten Oaks Road, Pfefferkorn Road, and Ivory Road in Glenelg, was completed in 2008.  The next project planned is to construct a diamond interchange at Linden Church Road, which presently meets MD 32 at a pair of signalized, three-way directional crossover intersections between Glenelg and Clarksville. The Linden Church Road interchange is expected to start construction in 2012.  Several other interchanges will be constructed or modified:  At MDSHA's Dayton Shop south of Glenelg, a half-diamond interchange will be built on the southbound side of MD 32 and a right-in/right-out interchange constructed for northbound MD 32 traffic to access the maintenance facility. North of Glenelg, Rosemary Lane will be extended west to cross over MD 32. The county highway will be connected to MD 32 via right-in/right-out interchanges between the state highway and frontage roads. In West Friendship, northbound MD 32 would have half of a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 144. Access between MD 144 and southbound MD 32 would be via a right-in/right-out interchange with a frontage road. MD 144's intersections with the frontage road and the ramps to and from northbound MD 32 will be roundabouts. MD 32's interchange with I-70 will be transformed from a diamond interchange to a partial cloverleaf interchange with free-flowing ramps from MD 32 to I-70.    Junction listMD 32 is signed east–west from I-97 in Millersville to MD 108 in Clarksville and north–south from MD 108 to Westminster.                                                                Auxiliary routesMD 32 has three existing auxiliary routes:  MD 32AA is the designation for Sappington Station Road, which runs   from westbound MD 32 west to MD 175 in Odenton. The state highway begins at the westbound MD 32 exit ramp for Exit 3. MD 32AA merges with the entrance ramp to westbound MD 32 and intersects the northern section of Burns Crossing Road before crossing over MD 32.  The state highway intersects the southern section of Burns Crossing Road and heads southwest to its terminus at a roundabout with MD 175 (Annapolis Road), Odenton Road, and Higgins Drive.   MD 32AH is the designation for Lodigiani Avenue, a   spur east from Gambrills Road just south of Gambrills Road's overpass of MD 32 in Gambrills.   MD 32B is the designation for the unnamed   connector between MD 32 and MD 851H, which is a spur of old alignment of MD 32 north of West Friendship.

Wye River (Maryland)   The Wye River is a   U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011  tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  It was named by the Lloyd family, Edward Lloyd (delegate), and Edward Lloyd (Governor of Maryland), after the River Wye in Wales. It falls within Queen Anne's County and Talbot County, and joins the Miles River near its mouth to the Eastern Bay.  The river is very popular with recreational boaters because of its many secluded anchorages, fishing, crabbing, natural beauty and proximity to the tourist attractions of St. Michaels, Maryland. Like many rivers on the Chesapeake Bay, the Wye is largely tidal.  The river's most notable feature is the   Wye Island, most of which is part of the Wye Island Natural Resources Management Area, managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources State Forest and Park Service.  William Paca, the third governor of Maryland and a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, once owned the island.The nearby Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Centers (sections of which were formerly known as the "Wye River plantation") hosted the 1998 Mideast Peace talks attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, and hosted by US President Bill Clinton. The watershed also includes the Wye Research and Education Center, operated by the University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station (MAES). They conduct agricultural research  and education, in cooperation with the nearby Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Centers.Elián González and his father stayed at the Wye River Plantation briefly in 2000.

Maryland Route 439  Maryland Route 439 (MD 439) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as Old York Road, the state highway runs   from MD 45 in Maryland Line east to MD 23 in Shawsville.  In conjunction with MD 23 and Interstate 83 (I-83), MD 439 connects Bel Air with York, Pennsylvania.  The state highway was constructed at both ends in the early 1930s.  The middle section of MD 439 was brought into the state highway system around 1980. Route descriptionMD 439 begins at an intersection with MD 45 (York Road) in Maryland Line a short distance south of the Pennsylvania state line.  The state highway heads east through a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with I-83 (Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway).  MD 439 heads southeast and passes through the hamlet of Shane as the highway follows the height of land between the drainage basins of Little Gunpowder Falls and Deer Creek.  Shortly after crossing the Baltimore–Harford county line, the state highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 23 (Norrisville Road) in Shawsville.   HistoryOld York Road was an alternate, less-direct route for traffic between Towson and Maryland Lane compared to York Road.  MD 439 is one of several extant stretches of the road; another segment is from south of Shawsville to MD 145 in Jacksonville, part of which is MD 562.   MD 439 was paved as a state highway in two segments between 1930 and 1933: from York Road east to Lentz Road, and from the Baltimore–Harford county line east to MD 23.    The state highway originally had an acute intersection with York Road north of the present terminal intersection.  MD 439 was relocated when I-83 was completed from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line in 1959.   The state highway remained in pieces until the intervening section of Old York Road was brought under state maintenance around 1981.

7th Regiment Maryland Volunteer Infantry   The 7th Regiment Maryland Volunteer Infantry was a regiment that participated in the American Civil War.  Edwin H. Webster was one of the regimental commanders.  This regiment was inducted into service on May 15, 1861.  After serving guard duty in the defenses of Washington, the regiment was sent to the Shenandoah Valley for operations.  Their first combat came on March 13, 1863 when they repulsed a charge by the 5th Virginia Infantry regiment.  They were sent to V Corps, Army of the Potomac.  At the Battle of Gettysburg, they were forced to withdraw from the Peach Orchard early on the second day.  They were among the units who repelled Pickett's charge.  Th unit was stationed for garrison duty in southern Pennsylvania and was involved in skirmishes against some of Jubal Early's infantry units.  Because of heavy losses at the Battle of Cold Harbor, they were sent as replacements to IV corps, Army of the Potomac.  They suffered heavy casualties during the Siege of Petersburg, having to repel six charges by counterattacking units of the 15th Georgia Volunteer Infantry.  They marched in the Grand review and were mustered out of service on June 3, 1865.This unit suffered the loss of 389 men, who were 23 officers and 366 enlisted men, and 65 of those men died of disease. 13 men were captured at Gettysburg, 5 of which perished at Libby Prison. Unit was noted by President Lincoln for being "very effective in combat and showing utmost loyalty to the cause of the great republic."  
Calvert, Maryland    Calvert is an unincorporated community in Cecil County, Maryland, United States, about 6 miles east of Rising Sun.  It is named for George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore.The center of the town is the Cross Keys Inn (Cross Keys Tavern) that was established there on the old Post Road (which is now Calvert Road) in 1774.  The Post Road was the main road that ran in between Philadelphia and Baltimore during Revolutionary times.  Directly next to the Cross Keys Inn (which is now a private brick residence), is the Calvert Elementary School, operated by Cecil County Public Schools.The main historical reference in Calvert is the "East Nottingham Friends House" at this intersection.  William Smallwood, a general during the Revolutionary War, used this building as a hospital for a short time in 1778, and several soldiers who died at the hospital are buried on its grounds.The John Churchman House and Elisha Kirk House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

1st Maryland Regiment            The 1st Maryland Regiment (Smallwood's Regiment) originated with the authorization of a Maryland Battalion of the Maryland State Troops on 14 January 1776. It was organized in the spring at Baltimore, Maryland (three companies) and Annapolis, Maryland (six companies) under the command of Colonel William Smallwood consisting of eight companies and one light infantry company from the northern and western counties of the colony of Maryland. HistoryOn 6 July 1776 the Maryland Battalion was assigned to the main Continental Army.  On 12 August 1776 it was assigned to Stirling's Brigade and five days later (17 August 1776) adopted into the main Continental Army. On 31 August the Maryland Battalion was re-assigned from Stirling's Brigade to McDougall's Brigade. On 19 September 1776 the Maryland Independent Companies were assigned to the Maryland Battalion. This element was relieved from McDougall's Brigade on 10 November 1776. From 10 December 1776 to January 1777 the element was assigned to Mercer's Brigade. In January 1777 this element was re-organized to eight companies and was re-designated as the 1st Maryland Regiment and assigned to the 1st Maryland Brigade on 22 May 1777 of the main continental Army. On 12 May 1779 the regiment was re-organized to nine companies. On 5 April 1780 the 1st Maryland Brigade was re-assigned to the Southern Department. On 1 January 1781 it was re-assigned to the Maryland Brigade of the Southern Department. The regiment would see action during the New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. The regiment was furloughed 27 July 1783 at Baltimore and disbanded on 15 November 1783.The Maryland Battalion distinguished itself at the Battle of Long Island by single-handedly covering the retreat of the American forces against numerically superior British and Hessian forces, with a group of men memorialized as the Maryland 400. Thereafter, General George Washington relied heavily upon the Marylanders as one of the few reliable fighting units in the early Continental Army.  For this reason, Maryland is sometimes known as "The Old Line State."    The lineage of this unit is perpetuated by the 175th Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard. Battle of BrooklynThe Maryland Regiment had joined the Continental Army barely two weeks before the Battle of Brooklyn. Unlike most of Washington's Army, the Maryland contingent had been well drilled at home and were so well equipped – they even had bayonets, a rarity for the Army – that the Regiment was known at home as the Dandy Fifth, and to the rest of the Army as "macaronis", the then current word for dandies. The Marylanders were put under Lord Stirling's brigade. When the British under Cornwallis surprised the Americans by circling around their rear, Stirling ordered all forces, other than the Marylanders, who were outside the fortified position on Brooklyn Heights to retreat there leaving behind himself and 4 companies of the 1st Maruyland. Stirling led these men who would come to be known as "The Maryland 400" men against Cornwallis' 2,000 British soldiers who were massed around the Old Stone House, a thick-walled fieldstone and brick fortification near today's Fifth Avenue and 3rd Street that had been built in 1699 to withstand Indian raids.In fierce fighting, the Marylanders charged the British forces six times to give their comrades time to make their way to safety with the rest of Washington's army in the Heights. Twice they managed to drive the British from the house, but as more British reinforcements arrived and the Marylanders casualties mounted, they finally had to give up the assault and try to get to safety themselves. Only Major Mordecai Gist and nine others managed to reach the American lines. Of the others, 256 lay dead in front of the Old Stone House and more than 100 were wounded/and or captured. The bravery of the Maryland Regiment earned them the name "immortals". The dead were buried in a mass grave comprised of six trenches in a farm field. The gravesite is located on what is now Third Avenue between 7th and 8th Streets. Until the widening of Third Avenue in 1910, the site was marked by a tablet that read: "Burial place of ye 256 Maryland soldiers who fell in ye combat at ye Cortelyou House on ye 27th day of August 1776." The result of the brief battle was stunning for the Americans. More than a thousand men were killed, captured, or missing. Generals Stirling and Sullivan were in the enemy's hands. The battalion had lost more than 250 of their number. Most of the Marylanders' casualties occurred in the retreat and desperate covering action at the Cortelyou House. Ultimately, of the original Maryland 400 muster, 96 returned, with only 35 fit for duty.Historian, Thomas Field, writing in 1869, "The Battle of Long Island," called the stand of the Marylanders "an hour more precious to liberty than any other in history." Four companies of the 1st Maryland stood as the final anchor of the crumbled American front line, and their heroic action not only saved many of their fellows but afforded Washington critical respite to regroup and withdraw his battered troops to Manhattan and continue the struggle for independence.Over time, the farm became the site of a Red Devil paint factory, and the burial grounds became part of a factory courtyard open to the sky because of a deed restriction relating to the grave. More time passed. The paint factory gave way to an auto repair shop and the courtyard was roofed over. Today the heroes whom Washington himself lamented lie under the floor of the building that had housed the auto repair shop. They lie in their unmarked grave miles from a Stanford White monument to their sacrifice in the form of a marble shaft topped with a sphere that stands at the foot of Lookout Hill in Prospect Park. It was erected in 1895 as a gift of the Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. The Old Stone House survived the battle and in later years became the first clubhouse of the baseball team that came to be known as the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was destroyed in the 1890s, and rebuilt in the 1930s.Source: The Battle of Brooklyn 1776 by John J.

2nd Maryland Regiment            The 2nd Maryland Regiment origins were authorized on 14 January 1776 in the Maryland State Troops as seven independent companies.From 7 to 14 March 1776 the companies were organized from various counties from the eastern region of the colony of Maryland. From 6 July to 15 August 1776 the companies were assigned to the main Continental Army and officially adopted on 17 August 1776.   In January 1777 the seven companies were organized as the 2nd Maryland Regiment with one additional company added.  On 22 May 1777 the regiment was assigned to the 2nd Maryland Brigade in the main Continental Army. On 12 May 1779 the regiment was re-organized to nine companies. The 2nd Maryland Brigade was re-assigned to the Southern Department on 5 April 1780. On 1 January 1781 the regiment was re-assigned to the Maryland Brigade of the Southern Department. The regiment would see action during the New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. the regiment was furloughed 1 January 1783 at Charleston, South Carolina and disbanded on 15 November 1783.

3rd Maryland Regiment        The 3rd Maryland Regiment was an infantry regiment of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. It served from 1776 to 1783, mostly in the Middle Atlantic Region of the conflict.  Background The 3rd Maryland Regiment was organized on 27 March 1776 of eight companies from Anne Arundel, Prince George's, Talbot, Harford and Somerset counties of the colony of Maryland.The regiment was authorized on 16 September 1776 for service with the Continental Army and was assigned on 27 December 1776 to the main element.    1st Maryland BrigadeOn 22 May 1777 it was assigned to the 1st Maryland Brigade.  The regiment was re-organized to nine companies on 12 May 1779.  On 5 April 1780 the 1st Maryland Brigade was re-assigned to the Southern Department.  The regiment was relieved from the 1st Maryland Brigade on 1 January 1781. It was assigned to Gist's Brigade on 24 September 1781 in the main Continental Army.  Three days later (27 September 1781) Gist's Brigade was re-assigned to the Southern Department. On 4 January 1782 the regiment was re-assigned from Gist's Brigade to the Maryland Brigade in the Southern Department. The regiment would see action during the  Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Camden, Battle of Guilford Court House, Battle of Eutaw Springs and the Battle of Yorktown. The regiment disbanded on 1 January 1783 at Charleston, South Carolina. Under Gist's commandGist became colonel in command of the 3rd Maryland on 10 December 1776.    On 22 May 1777, George Washington assigned the regiment to the 1st Maryland Brigade together with the 1st Delaware Regiment, and the 1st, 5th, 7th Maryland Regiments.  During the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777, both the popular brigade commander William Smallwood and Gist were on detached duty recruiting the Maryland militia. This left the disliked Frenchman Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre as the senior brigadier.  The regiment was in John Sullivan's division on the right flank, guarding Brinton's Ford while other elements of the division guarded three upstream fords.  Finding that the greater part of Sir William Howe's army had marched into the right rear of his division, Sullivan had to march cross country in an attempt to block the move. Finding his division in an awkward position, Sullivan rode off to confer with Adam Stephen and Lord Stirling and ordered De Borre to shift the division to the right. The inept Frenchman botched the evolution, throwing the troops into disorder just as they came under attack by the Brigade of Guards.  According to John Hoskins Stone, commander of the 1st Maryland, only his regiment and the 3rd put up a creditable fight. As they tried to resist the oncoming British, the confused 2nd Brigade mistakenly fired a volley into the two regiments from behind. The badly mishandled Marylanders then fled. Gist commanded the 3rd Maryland at the Battle of Germantown. He led the 3rd Maryland until 9 January 1779 when he was promoted brigadier general in command of the 2nd Maryland Brigade.    Battle of MonmouthAt Monmouth, the regiment was commanded by Colonel Mordecai Gist  while its second-in-command was Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Ramsey.  Ramsey was detached to Colonel James Wesson's detachment under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne. Early in the battle, Wesson was wounded and Ramsey assumed command of his detachment.   Presumably, part of the regiment was detached with Ramsey, but this is not directly stated by the source.  Surprised by a sudden British counterattack, the American advance guard began to retreat. Washington personally asked Ramsey and Colonel Walter Stewart to hold off the British while he arranged the main line of defense. The two officers agreed and Wayne deployed their soldiers in a nearby wood.  As the Brigade of Guards came up to their hidden position, the Americans opened fire into their flank. The Guards charged and cleared the wood after a tough fight in which they lost 40 casualties including Colonel Henry Trelawney wounded. Stewart was shot and carried off. The retreating Americans were set upon in the open by a troop of the 16th Light Dragoons.  A dragoon rode up to the unhorsed Ramsey and fired at him with his pistol. The weapon misfired and Ramsey attacked the trooper with his sword, dragged him from his horse, and tried to ride away. Surrounded by dragoons, Ramsey was badly wounded and left for dead. Later, the British picked him up as a prisoner. Impressed by his bravery, the British commander Sir Henry Clinton paroled Ramsey the next day. Ramsey was not exchanged until December 1780.

4th Maryland Regiment         The 4th Maryland Regiment was organized on 27 March 1776 with eight companies from Baltimore, Anne Arundel and Somerset counties in the colony of Maryland. It was authorized on 16 September 1776 for service with the Continental Army and assigned to the main on 27 December 1776. It was assigned to the 2d Maryland Brigade on 22 May 1777. The regiment was re-organized to nine companies on 12 May 1779. On 5 April 1780 the 2d Maryland Brigade was re-assigned to the Southern Department. On 1 January 1781 the regiment was relieved from the 2d Maryland Brigade. On 24 September 1781 the regiment was assigned to Gist's Brigade in the main Continental Army. Three days later, (27 September 1781) Gist's Brigade was re-assigned to the Southern Department. On 4 January 1782 the regiment was re-assigned to the Maryland Brigade in the Southern Department.

5th Maryland Regiment           The 5th Maryland Regiment is a designation which has been held by several units over the years, not all of which necessarily share the same lineage and honors. Although the first unit to carry the "5th Maryland" designation was organized in 1776 from volunteers in rural Maryland, the designation has been most often associated with militia units in Baltimore. The "5th Maryland" designation is the officially recognized traditional designation of the 175th Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard.  American RevolutionThe first 5th Maryland Regiment was organized on 27 March 1776 composing of eight companies of   from the counties of Queen Anne's, Kent, Caroline, and Dorchester of the colony of Maryland and was authorized on 16 September 1776 for service with the Continental Army. It was assigned to the main Continental Army on 27 December 1776.  On 22 May 1777, it was assigned to the 1st Maryland Brigade and re-organized on 12 May 1779 to nine companies. It was re-assigned to the Southern Department on 5 April 1780.  The regiment was re-assigned from the 1st Maryland Brigade to the Maryland Brigade on 1 January 1781. The regiment would see action during the Battle of Long Island (1776), the Battle of Brandywine (1777), the Battle of Germantown (1777), the Battle of Monmouth (1778), the Battle of Camden (1780), and the Battle of Guilford Court House (1781). The regiment was furloughed 1 January 1782, at Round O, South Carolina and disbanded on 1 January 1783.   War of 1812  The 5th Maryland Regiment saw action during the War of 1812 at both the Battle of Bladensberg   and the Battle of North Point. At Bladensberg the regiment was defeated, along with the rest of the army, by the advancing British, but at North Point they proved more effective. There, the Maryland Volunteers under General John Stricker bore the brunt of the British attack, holding off the enemy long enough for the defense of Baltimore to be successfully shored up. The battle formed part of the larger Battle of Baltimore and proved a turning point in the War of 1812. Not all the militia regiments performed with equal distinction. The 51st, and some members of 39th, broke and ran under fire. However, the 5th and 27th held their ground and were able to retreat in good order having inflicted significant casualties on the advancing enemy.   Corporal John McHenry of the 5th Regiment wrote an account of the battle:  "Our Regiment, the 5th, carried off the praise from the other regiments engaged, so did the company to which I have the honor to belong cover itself with glory. When compared to the [other] Regiments we were the last that left the ground...had our Regiment not retreated at the time it did we should have been cut off in two minutes."     Civil WarWith the outbreak of the Civil War, most members of the 5th Regiment travelled south to join for the Confederacy. The unit combined with the 53rd Maryland Infantry to reform as the 1st Maryland Infantry (CSA) and served under Stonewall Jackson.  Modern Fifth RegimentAnother 5th Maryland, nicknamed "The Dandy Fifth," was formed in 1867. The lineage of this unit is carried on today by the Maryland Army National Guard's 175th Infantry Regiment. This 5th Maryland also traces its lineage back to the American Revolution, but ironically, its lineage does not include the Revolutionary War 5th Regiment.  Instead, it traces its ancestry to militia raised in Baltimore, and its battle honors differ from those of the Revolutionary 5th Regiment. The 175th Infantry's lineage and honors does include the 5th Maryland Regiment of the War of 1812 and 1st Maryland Infantry (CSA) of the American Civil War.

Maryland Route 16    Maryland Route 16 (MD 16) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway runs   from Taylors Island east to the Delaware state line in Hickman, where the highway continues as Delaware Route 16 (DE 16).  MD 16 connects Cambridge with several communities in northern Dorchester County and southwestern Caroline, including East New Market and Preston.  The state highway runs concurrently with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Cambridge, MD 331 between East New Market and Preston, and both MD 404 and MD 313 near Andersontown.  The state highway is a part of the National Highway System along its concurrencies with US 50 and MD 404.   MD 16 was constructed between Church Creek and Preston as one of the original state roads in the early and mid-1910s.  The highway was extended in both directions in the late 1910s: north to what was to be designated MD 313 near Denton and west to Taylors Island.  MD 16 was extended through Andersontown to the Delaware state line in the early 1930s.  MD 16's bypass of Cambridge was constructed in the mid-1960s. Route description Dorchester CountyMD 16 begins on Taylors Island a short distance west of the bridge over Slaughter Creek to the mainland.  The roadway continues west as county-maintained Hoopers Neck Road, which provides access to the historic Ridgeton Farm, Grace Episcopal Church Complex, and Bethlehem Methodist Episcopal Church.  MD 16 heads northeast from the island as two-lane Taylors Island Road.  The state highway crosses Parsons Creek and passes through the hamlets of Madison and Woolford on its way to the town of Church Creek, where MD 16 intersects MD 335 (Golden Hill Road).  MD 16 continues northeast as Church Creek Road toward Cambridge, where the state highway intersects MD 341 (Race Street), which is the old alignment of MD 16, just beyond Cambridge-South Dorchester High School along the southern edge of the city.  MD 16 continues east and intersects the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, then curves north to US 50 (Ocean Gateway).  The state highway joins US 50 in a concurrency along the four-lane divided highway.  US 50 and MD 16 intersect Bucktown Road, which leads southeast to Cambridge-Dorchester Airport, and both ends of MD 750 (Old Route 50) before reaching the eastern end of the concurrency in the community of Whitehall, also known as Mount Holly.  MD 16 heads northeast from US 50 as two-lane Mount Holly Road.  As the state highway approaches East New Market, the western terminus of MD 14 (Secretary Road) heads north toward Secretary and MD 392 (East New Market Bypass) heads northeast toward Hurlock.  MD 16 turns north into the town, where the highway passes through the East New Market Historic District as Main Street.  The state highway intersects MD 14 (Railroad Avenue) before leaving town as East New Market Ellwood Road.  MD 16 crosses the Warwick River and Cabin Creek before meeting MD 331 (Waddells Corner Road) at Waddells Corner.  MD 16 joins MD 331 in a concurrency that crosses Gravel Creek and passes Beulah Road, the old alignment of MD 16 and MD 331 through Ellwood.  After an at-grade crossing of the Preston Branch of the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, the two state highways intersect MD 318 (Preston Road) and continue northwest as Preston Road, which passes near the Jacob and Hannah Leverton House before crossing Hunting Creek into Caroline County.   Caroline County The MD 16–MD 331 concurrency continues northwest through Linchester, where the highway passes both ends of MD 817 (Linchester Road), which provides access to the historic Linchester Mill.  The state highways continue through the town of Preston as Main Street.  Unsigned MD 324 (Maple Avenue) heads south from MD 16 and MD 331 before the two highways split on the west side of town.  MD 16 heads north as Harmony Road through the hamlet of Grove and intersects MD 578 (Bethlehem Road) in the community of Harmony.  The state highway crosses Fowling Creek and Robins Creek and passes through the hamlet of Two Johns, which is also known as Bureau.  As MD 16 passes to the west of Williston Lake, an impoundment of Mill Creek, the highway closely parallels its old alignment, MD 617.  The state highway passes through the Williston Mill Historic District just east of the community of Williston, which contains the historic homes Potter Hall and Memory Lane.  MD 16 continues northeast until reaching an intersection with MD 404 and MD 313 (Shore Highway) south of Denton.  MD 16 turns southeast onto Shore Highway, a four-lane divided highway that reduces to two lanes east of the intersection, to form a triple state highway concurrency.  The three state highways continue east to Andersontown, where MD 313 heads south as Federalsburg Highway.  A short distance to the east, MD 404 continues straight southeast while MD 16 turns northeast onto Greenwood Road.  Shortly thereafter, MD 16 reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line in Hickman.  The highway continues east as DE 16 (Hickman Road) toward Greenwood.   HistoryThe portion of MD 16 between Church Creek and East New Market via Cambridge was chosen as one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909.   The portion of the highway between Bureau and the western junction with MD 313 and MD 404 south of Denton was also included in the planned state road system; that piece of highway was the first part of modern MD 16 completed in 1910.    MD 16 was completed from Mount Holly to East New Market in 1911, from Cambridge to Mount Holly in 1913, from East New Market to Preston via Linchester in 1914, and from Church Creek to Cambridge in 1915.  The gap in the state highway within East New Market was closed in 1917.   The segment of highway between Preston and Grove was surfaced by 1915.   MD 16 between Grove and Bureau was under construction by 1919 and finished around 1920.  The state highway was constructed from the bridge to Taylor's Island to Church Creek between 1917 and 1919. When numbers were assigned to state highways in Maryland in 1927, MD 16 had a concurrency with US 213 between Waddell's Corner and Preston.   Greenwood Road from MD 404 in Andersontown to the Delaware state line was built between 1930 and 1933, concurrent with the completion of the connecting section of MD 404.    MD 16 was extended north and east through Andersontown to the Delaware state line by 1939, giving the state highway additional concurrencies with MD 313 and MD 404.  Also in 1939, US 213 between Easton and Vienna was transferred to a new route via Cambridge; the old portion of US 213 was designated MD 331 and the new section of US 213 became concurrent with MD 16 between Cambridge and Mount Holly.   Within Cambridge, MD 16 followed Race Street north to Washington Street, which the highway followed east toward Mount Holly. The next changes in MD 16 occurred in the 1950s.  MD 16 was extended west across Slaughter Creek to Taylors Island when a new bridge was completed in 1950.   MD 313 was moved to its present alignment between Federalsburg and Denton in 1954; as a result, MD 16 became the sole route from Bureau to MD 404 south of Denton and part of a triple concurrency from there to Andersontown.   US 50, which had replaced US 213 from Ocean City to Wye Mills in 1949, was expanded to a divided highway along its concurrency with MD 16 by 1955.     MD 331 and MD 16 were realigned around Ellwood and Linchester around 1960.    MD 16 was relocated to bypass Cambridge in 1967; the state highway's old route through the city was transferred to newly designated MD 341 and an extension of MD 343 east to US 50.   MD 16 was relocated at Williston Lake shortly after the construction of a new bridge across the lake's outlet, Mill Creek, in 1968.   The state highway was straightened out through Madison in 1970, leaving behind Old Madison Road.  Junction list                                              Auxiliary routeMD 16A is the designation for the   section of Beauchamp Branch Road between MD 16 and its old alignment, MD 617, just south of Williston Lake near Williston.

Maryland Route 480  Maryland Route 480 (MD 480) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as Ridgely Road, the state highway runs   from MD 404 in Hillsboro east to MD 313 in Greensboro.  MD 480 passes through Ridgely, where it has a concurrency with MD 312.  The state highway was constructed between Ridgely and Greensboro in the early 1930s.  MD 480 was rerouted in both towns in the early 1950s before being extended west to Hillsboro in the late 1950s. Route descriptionMD 480 begins at an intersection with MD 404 in Hillsboro.  Ridgely Road continues south toward the center of Hillsboro.  MD 480 heads northeast through farmland until it meets MD 312 (Downes Station Road) on the outskirts of Ridgely.  The two state highways continue northeast, with MD 776 (Sunset Boulevard) splitting to the north immediately before the road enters the town limits of Ridgely, where its name temporarily changes to Sixth Street and the highway passes Martin Sutton Memorial Park.  The concurrency of MD 480 and MD 312 ends where the latter highway heads north into the center of town on Central Avenue.  MD 480 heads east out of town, continuing straight through farmland.  After traversing Forge Branch, the state highway veers to the northeast, paralleling the Choptank River at a distance until the highway enters Greensboro, where its name changes again to Main Street.  MD 480 intersects MD 314 (Sunset Avenue) in the center of the town.  The state highway traverses an S-curve and passes Greensboro Elementary School before reaching its northern terminus at MD 313 (Greensboro Road).   HistoryMD 480 was under construction from Ridgely to Greensboro by 1932 and completed in 1933.     The state highway originally followed Central Avenue in Ridgely south from MD 312, then turned east onto Sixth Street toward Greensboro.  In Greensboro, MD 480 had its eastern terminus at present-day MD 314.  MD 480 north to its present eastern terminus and MD 314 east across the Choptank River were originally part of MD 313.   When MD 313 bypassed Greensboro in 1950, MD 480 was extended north through Greensboro to its present terminus.   When the Ridgely Cutoff was completed in 1953, MD 312 replaced MD 480 on Central Avenue.    MD 480's western terminus was the intersection of Central Avenue and Sixth Street until MD 480 was extended west to MD 404 in Hillsboro in 1959.

Maryland Route 328  Maryland Route 328 (MD 328) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway runs   from U.S. Route 50 (US 50) in Easton east to just north of MD 404 in West Denton.  MD 328 connects Easton with Denton, passing through eastern Talbot County and a neck of land in Caroline County between the Choptank River and Tuckahoe Creek.  MD 328 was constructed in Talbot County in the late 1910s between downtown Easton and a point west of Matthews.  The state highway was constructed in Caroline County in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and was originally designated MD 457.  The gap between the two highways was filled in the late 1940s and included a modern bridge over Tuckahoe Creek.  MD 328's western terminus was moved to US 50 in the early 1960s.  In West Denton, the highway was relocated and extended north to present MD 404 in the early 1980s. Route descriptionMD 328 begins at an intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway) in Easton.  The roadway continues west on the opposite side of the intersection as Goldsborough Street toward downtown Easton.  MD 328 heads northeast as Matthewstown Road, a two-lane road that passes by residential subdivisions before entering farmland.  After the intersection with Black Dog Alley, the state highway crosses Galloway Creek, Wootenaux Creek, and two unnamed tributaries of Kings Creek.  MD 328 passes Ewing Airport, then crosses Beaverdam Branch before intersecting Lewistown Road in the hamlet of Matthews.  A short distance east of Matthews, the state highway crosses Tuckahoe Creek on a bridge dedicated to Frederick Douglass.  MD 328 continues into Caroline County as New Bridge Road, passing through farmland until the highway reaches West Denton.  River Landing Road, the old alignment of MD 328 that approaches the Choptank River riverfront, splits to the northeast, while the state highway continues north past the Neck Meetinghouse and Yard to an intersection with MD 404 Business (Meeting House Road), which provides access to downtown Denton.  MD 328 passes the other end of River Landing Road before reaching an intersection with the Denton Bypass, MD 404 (Shore Highway).  The state highway ends just north of the intersection with MD 404; River Road continues north as a county highway toward Ridgely.   HistoryThe first section of MD 328 was paved from Easton to a point just east of Wootenaux Creek by 1919.   In addition, another section of present-day MD 328 was paved from MD 404 (now MD 404 Business) in West Denton southwest about   by 1921.   The Talbot County portion of the highway was extended to just west of Beaverdam Branch, about   west of Matthews, by 1923.   The Caroline County portion of the highway was extended southwest to Tuckahoe Creek in two sections in 1933 and 1935 and was designated MD 457.   After World War II, construction began to fill the   gap between the eastern end of MD 328 and the western end of MD 457.   The new bridge over Tuckahoe Creek and the remainder of the highway were completed in 1947 and by 1948 the MD 328 designation was applied to the whole highway from Easton to Denton.     By 1963, the western terminus had been rolled back from downtown Easton to US 50.   In West Denton, MD 328 was moved to a new alignment in 1981 since the old alignment had been overpassed by MD 404's new bridge over the Choptank River in 1980.    MD 328 was extended to its present terminus in 1985 ahead of the opening of the Denton bypass in 1987.  A new bridge over Tuckahoe Creek was built immediately downstream from the former MD 328 bridge.  The new bridge opened to traffic in October 2012.

Maryland Route 179  Maryland Route 179 (MD 179) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as St. Margarets Road, the highway runs   from MD 648 near Annapolis east to the end of state maintenance in Cape St. Claire. MD 179 serves a suburban area near the southern end of the Broadneck Peninsula of northeastern Anne Arundel County. The state highway was paved in the 1920s from its western end to Skidmore near Sandy Point. MD 179 was truncated at what is now U.S. Route 50 and US 301 when their predecessor highway replaced the stretch to Skidmore in the early 1940s. MD 179 was extended into Cape St. Claire in the early 1990s. Route descriptionMD 179 begins at an intersection with MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard) east of Annapolis. The state highway heads northeast as two-lane St. Margarets Road, which crosses Mill Creek and passes through the hamlet of St. Margarets, the site of St. Margaret's Episcopal Church. At Holly Drive, which is unsigned MD 931L, MD 179 expands to a two-lane divided highway with auxiliary lanes. The highway has an intersection with Buschs Frontage Road and Whitehall Road, which are unsigned MD 908A and MD 908C, respectively. Buschs Frontage Road leads to ramps to and from eastbound US 50 and US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). MD 179 receives a ramp from the eastbound freeway immediately before it crosses over the freeway, then intersects ramps to and from westbound US 50 and US 301. The highway continues northeast as Cape St. Claire Road and intersects College Parkway, which is unsigned MD 931Q. MD 179 reduces to two lanes for the final stretch before its eastern terminus at an arbitrary spot between Woodland Circle, which is unsigned MD 931U, and Forest Terrace. Cape St. Claire Road continues as a county highway into the center of the namesake community at the mouth of the Magothy River.   HistoryMD 179 was constructed from the Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard (later MD 2 and now MD 648) east to St. Margarets in 1920.   The highway was extended to the site of the US 50 interchange in 1928.  MD 179 was extended east to Skidmore, a hamlet just west of what is today Sandy Point State Park, in 1929 and 1930.    Between 1942 and 1944, a ferry terminal was constructed at Sandy Point as the new western end of the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry.   A   highway was constructed from MD 2 east to the new terminal along the alignment of the modern US 50 freeway.  This highway, which was designated a westward extension of MD 404 by 1946, replaced the portion of MD 179 east of the modern US 50 interchange.  MD 179's interchange with US 50 was constructed in 1991.   The state highway was expanded to a divided highway through the interchange and extended northeast to its present terminus in Cape St. Claire.

Maryland Route 7  Maryland Route 7 (MD 7) is a collection of state highways in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for much of their length as Philadelphia Road, there are five disjoint mainline sections of the highway totaling   that parallel U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Baltimore, Harford, and Cecil counties in northeastern Maryland. The longest section of MD 7 begins at US 40 just east of the city of Baltimore in Rosedale and extends through eastern Baltimore County and southern Harford County to US 40 in Aberdeen. The next segment of the state highway is a C-shaped route through Havre de Grace. The third mainline section of MD 7 begins in Perryville and ends at US 40 a short distance west of the start of the fourth section, which passes through Charlestown and North East before ending at US 40 just west of Elkton. The fifth segment of the highway begins at MD 213 and passes through downtown Elkton before reconnecting with US 40 west of the Delaware state line.MD 7 is the old alignment of US 40 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid out early in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between Baltimore and Philadelphia and between the northern and southern colonies. The highway in Baltimore and Harford counties became a turnpike in the 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission marked portions of what became known as the Philadelphia Road close to Baltimore and between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated US 40 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway between 1935 and 1941. Old sections of US 40 became segments of MD 7 between 1938 and 1941 as portions of the new four-lane divided highway opened from Baltimore to Elkton. Route descriptionThere are five mainline sections of MD 7:  MD 7 (without suffix) runs   from US 40 in Rosedale to US 40 and MD 159 in Aberdeen. MD 7A extends   from US 40 west of Havre de Grace to US 40 and MD 155 in the city. MD 7B has a length of   from Perry Point VA Medical Center in Perryville to US 40 east of Perryville. MD 7C runs   from US 40 west of Charlestown east to US 40 and MD 279 west of Elkton. MD 7D spans   from MD 213 east to US 40 within Elkton.    Baltimore–Aberdeen MD 7 begins at an intersection with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) in Rosedale just east of the Baltimore city line. The highway heads north then immediately turns east at a three-way intersection; the west leg of the intersection is Old Philadelphia Road, which is unsigned MD 7BA. MD 7 heads northeast as a two-lane street through a residential neighborhood with scattered businesses and industrial properties as well as a crossing of Redhouse Creek. The route intersects MD 588 (Golden Ring Road) and expands to a five-lane road with center turn lane before meeting Interstate 695 (I-695) (Baltimore Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. MD 7 continues east past The Centre at Golden Ring shopping center, crossing Stemmers Run before its intersection with Rossville Boulevard in Rossville. The state highway reduces to two lanes and continues northeast through residential subdivisions on the westbound side and industrial facilities on the eastbound side of the highway.  MD 7 expands to a five-lane highway with center turn lane as it approaches Campbell Boulevard in White Marsh. The road passes between a pair of shopping centers before crossing White Marsh Run. MD 7 continues northeast between industrial parks, intersecting Industrial Park Road (unsigned MD 7J) before reducing to two lanes and crossing MD 43 (White Marsh Boulevard). Westbound MD 43 is accessed via a ramp east of the overpass. The state highway crosses Honeygo Run and passes through a mix of forest and residential subdivisions, intersecting Cowenton Avenue and Joppa Road before crossing Gunpowder Falls. MD 7 passes through farmland and intersects Bradshaw Road in the hamlet of Bradshaw before crossing Little Gunpowder Falls and entering Harford County.   MD 7 heads east through forest and scattered residential subdivisions through the northern fringe of Joppatowne, where the highway intersects Old Mountain Road and MD 152 (Mountain Road). The route crosses Winters Run and intersects Edgewood Road and MD 24 (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway) in Edgewood. MD 7 crosses Haha Branch and meets Abingdon Road at Abingdon, which is home to the Nelson-Reardon-Kennard House. The highway intersects MD 136 (Calvary Road) in between crossings of Bynum Run and James Run, which flow into the Bush River. MD 7 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway as it passes through the commercial area of Riverside, where the highway meets MD 543 (Creswell Road) just south of that highway's interchange with I-95. The road passes through forest with isolated residential subdivisions, one of which is served by Holly Oak Circle, which meets MD 7 at a roundabout.  MD 7's name changes to Old Philadelphia Road as it crosses Grays Run. Beyond Stepney Road, the state highway curves to the southeast to cross over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, passing between industrial parks before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40 (Pulaski Highway) on the western edge of Aberdeen. Old Philadelphia Road continues east as MD 159 before becoming a county highway that serves an industrial area, intersects MD 715 (Short Lane), and passes the historic home Poplar Hill, after which the highway merges with US 40 just west of downtown Aberdeen.     Havre de Grace MD 7 begins at an intersection with US 40 just west of Havre de Grace. The highway heads northeast as two-lane Revolution Street, crossing the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and passing through an industrial area before entering a residential area upon entering the city limits. MD 7 veers east to enter the street grid at Bloomsbury Avenue. The state highway turns north onto Union Street, which heads south as MD 490, adjacent to Harford Memorial Hospital. The route heads through the Havre de Grace Historic District, passing through a residential area about four blocks from the Susquehanna River waterfront through Congress Street, where the highway begins to approach the waterfront. Immediately after passing under the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge, MD 7 turns west onto Otsego Street. The highway reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with Otsego Street, MD 155 (Ohio Street), and US 40 (Pulaski Highway), which crosses the Susquehanna River a short distance to the east on the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge.   Perryville MD 7 begins at the entrance to the Perry Point VA Medical Center just north and east of the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge adjacent to Rodgers Tavern in the town of Perryville. The highway heads east as municipally maintained Broad Street, passing under both railtoad tracks of the wye of Norfolk Southern Railway's Columbia & Port Deposit line with the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, within which is the Perryville MARC station. Maintenance responsibility transfers from the town of Perryville to the state at MD 222 (Aiken Avenue). MD 7 heads east over Mill Creek, past MD 327 (Ikea Way), and leaves the town limits after an intersection with Coudon Boulevard, which leads to US 40. The route continues east as Principio Furnace Road through farmland, passing the historic home Woodlands and Furnace Bay Golf Course. MD 7 passes the remains of Principio Furnace and crosses Principio Creek before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40.   Charlestown–Elkton MD 7 begins at US 40 (Pulaski Highway) northwest of Charlestown, a short distance east of the terminus of MD 7B. The highway heads southeast as two-lane Old Philadelphia Road in a forested area between a pair of quarries. As MD 7 approaches the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, MD 267 (Baltimore Street) splits to the southeast and crosses the tracks to pass through Charlestown, while MD 7 begins to closely parallel the tracks along the northern edge of the town. The state highway receives the other end of MD 267 (Bladen Street) as it curves away from the railroad. MD 7 crosses Broad Creek and Stony Run before passing under the Amtrak line.  MD 7 crosses North East Creek and enters the town of North East, where the highway is known as Cecil Avenue. The highway intersects MD 272, which follows a one-way pair, Main Street southbound and Mauldin Avenue northbound. MD 7 leaves the town and passes through a forested area with scattered residences. The route passes through an S-curve during which it crosses to the north side of the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. On the north side of the bridge is a stub of old alignment, MD 7H. MD 7 continues east, passing Old Elk Neck Road before turning north and reaching its eastern terminus at US 40. The roadway continues beyond the intersection as MD 279 (Elkton Road).   Elkton MD 7 begins at MD 213 (Bridge Street) at the west end of downtown Elkton. Main Street continues west as a two-lane street through a mixed residential and industrial area beyond Landing Lane, which leads to Elk Landing and US 40 (Pulaski Highway), to a dead end at the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. MD 7 heads east as a one-lane, one-way street maintained by the town of Elkton. Westbound traffic can follow High Street, which passes by Union Hospital, around the downtown area. Within downtown, MD 7 intersects MD 268 (North Street) and passes by the Mitchell House and the Cecil County Circuit Courthouse. The highway becomes two-way and state-maintained at South Street. East of downtown, Main Street continues east as MD 281 while MD 7 turns southeast onto Delaware Avenue. The state highway crosses Big Elk Creek and passes through a residential area before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40 (Pulaski Highway) about   west of the Delaware state line.   History Predecessor roads and state road construction The rough alignment of what is now MD 7 in Baltimore and Harford counties existed by 1695 as a rudimentary road; Baltimore County ordered that the road be widened to   in width to allow easy passage for carts and for bridges to replace ferries at the numerous creeks along the route. In 1717, the route from Baltimore to Elkton became part of a new overland post road between Philadelphia and Williamsburg. The highway between Baltimore and Havre de Grace was maintained as a turnpike, the Baltimore and Havre-de-Grace Turnpike, by 1825.  This turnpike later became known as the Baltimore and Philadelphia Turnpike and, after collection of tolls had ceased on the highway, the Philadelphia Road or the Post Road.   The final ferry along the route to be eliminated was the Susquehanna River crossing. The first vehicular bridge was a converted railroad bridge built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1873, replaced with the current Amtrak bridge immediately to the north in 1904, and converted into a tolled vehicular bridge owned by several citizens of Harford and Cecil counties in 1910. The Maryland State Roads Commission purchased the bridge in 1923 and removed the tolls in 1928. In 1926, the commission double-decked the bridge to increase the bridge's capacity. When the Maryland State Roads Commission laid out a proposed state road system in 1909, two sections of the Philadelphia Road were included: from the eastern city limit of Baltimore, then at Elwood Avenue, east to Rossville in Baltimore County, and from Perryville to Elkton. The highway was paved as an   wide tarred macadam road from Elwood Avenue to Herring Run in 1910.  The remainder of the road from Herring Run to Rossville was completed in concrete by 1921.  In Cecil County, the Philadelphia Road was paved with a   wide macadam surface from the eastern town limit of North East to the western town limit of Elkton in 1913. The highway was paved in concrete from Perryville to Principio Creek and in macadam from there through Charlestown in 1914. The state road was paved in macadam from Charlestown to North East, including Cecil Avenue within the latter, in 1915.  The section of the state road through Charlestown, which is now MD 267, was bypassed with a concrete road that remained on the north side of the Pennsylvania Railroad by 1921. The section of the Post Road between Bel Air Avenue in Aberdeen and the former racetrack in Havre de Grace, much of which is now MD 132, was paved under the state aid system as a   wide macadam road by 1911.   The first section of the gap between Rossville and Aberdeen was filled with a concrete road from Bradshaw to Winters Run by 1921.  The remainder of the highway in Baltimore County and the section from Winters Run to Bynum Run were paved in concrete by 1923.  The final piece of Philadelphia Road in Harford County was completed as a concrete road from Bynum Run to Aberdeen in 1926.  The highway was paved in concrete along Main Street and Delaware Avenue through Elkton, with the exception of a gap at the west end of town, by 1923.  The gap between Elkton and the Delaware state line was filled in 1925. The   gap at the west end of Elkton was left in inferior condition in anticipation of a grade separation of the Pennsylvania Railroad.  This grade separation and its approaches was completed in 1929, completing US 40, which had been assigned to the length of the Philadelphia Road in 1927.   Improvements and construction of Pulaski HighwayImprovements to US 40 began shortly after its designation. The highway was widened to   in width from Baltimore to Rosedale and from Aberdeen to Havre de Grace, and to   between Rosedale and Aberdeen, by 1930.  US 40 was also widened to   from Perryville to the Delaware state line by 1934.  The Cecil County section of the highway was widened again with a pair of   shoulders in 1937 and 1938.  The U.S. Highway was relocated to its present alignment through Aberdeen to eliminate a pair of crossings of the Pennsylvania Railroad between 1930 and 1933; the old highway south of the railroad tracks became an extension of MD 22.    However, the very high levels of traffic due to being the main highway between Baltimore and Philadelphia led to calls for the highway to be expanded to   in width along its entire length by 1934.  Rather than widen the existing road further, the Maryland State Roads Commission decided to build a new Philadelphia Road, later known as Pulaski Highway, as a divided highway on a new alignment between Baltimore and Aberdeen and to expand the newly relocated highway through Aberdeen to Havre de Grace to a four-lane divided highway.  The new US 40 was started in 1935 and completed in 1938.   The original Philadelphia Road between Baltimore and Aberdeen became the first section of MD 7.  The next sections of the old highway to be bypassed were in Havre de Grace and Perryville when the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge and its approaches opened in August 1940, replacing the double-decked converted railroad bridge.  The portions of the old highway on either side of the river became additional sections of MD 7.  Construction on the new Philadelphia Road in Cecil County began in 1938 and was completed in 1941.   Transfer of US 40 to its new alignment resulted in the addition of two more sections of MD 7 from west of Charlestown through North East to west of Elkton and through Elkton. Despite the bypassing of the original Philadelphia Road, improvements continued to be made to MD 7. The state highway was widened with dual   shoulders from the Baltimore city limit to Rossville in 1938.  MD 7 was widened through Havre de Grace in 1953 and through Elkton in 1954.  The highway was relocated and became a divided highway on both sides of its intersection with MD 543 in Riverside concurrent with the construction of MD 543's interchange with I-95 in 1989.  MD 7's roundabout at Holly Oak Circle in Riverside was installed in 2000.  Several portions of the state highway have been transferred to local maintenance. The portion of MD 7 to the south of US 40 in the southern portion of Aberdeen was removed in 1950; MD 159 was extended north to MD 7's new eastern terminus and the remainder of Old Philadelphia Road became the responsibility of Harford County and Aberdeen.  MD 7 between MD 213 and South Street in Elkton became one-way eastbound in 2001 and municipally maintained in 2003.   The western terminus of that section of MD 7 was truncated at MD 213 in 2010, resulting in the portion of Main Street from a dead end at the Amtrak Northeast Corridor to MD 213 also becoming the responsibility of Elkton.

Sherwood High School (Maryland)     Sherwood High School is a secondary school in Sandy Spring in unincorporated Montgomery County, Maryland. Sherwood's program of interest is the international studies program, and is also known for its music and athletic programs.  Sherwood draws students from Farquhar and Rosa Parks Middle Schools.Sherwood serves the towns of Olney, Ashton, and Brookeville. HistorySherwood Academy was built on a piece of land donated in 1883, that was once part of Sherwood Farm – named because the abundance of trees was reminiscent of Robin Hood's Sherwood Forest.   In 1906, Sherwood became the third public high school in Montgomery County, after Richard Montgomery High School and Gaithersburg High School. The original school building was replaced in 1950,    and the one thousand seat Ertzman theatre was added in 1974. The school was renovated in 1989-1991, during which students were temporarily moved to the Northwood High School building in Wheaton. During the summer of 2007, a new wing was added to the school, creating new class rooms for science and English. Student bodySherwood High School has 2240 students enrolled for the 2005-2006 school year. The school's student body is 63% Caucasian, 15.6% African American, 11.1% Asian, 9.9% Hispanic, and 0.4% American Indian.   The graduation rate for the school is 93.6%, with 79.3% planning to go on to college.   In SAT testing, students have an average score of 553 (math), 532 (verbal), and 1085 (total), which places Sherwood under the Montgomery County average of 1102 (total), but above the national average of 1028 (total).  AcademicsThe International Studies Program distinguishes the school by providing a uniquely focused program. The program was established in 1998, coinciding with broader restructuring that occurred with the opening of the nearby James Hubert Blake High School. Blake High School, along with Paint Branch High School and Springbrook High School formed the Northeast Consortium of schools. The consortium provides each with a uniquely specialized program which students can opt for instead of attending their local school. While Sherwood is not a member of the consortium, it established the International Studies Program. Sherwood is a member of the International Studies Schools Association, a national network of schools dedicated to improving students' understanding of the world. In 2006, Sherwood High School was listed in the Newsweeks top 1200 American High Schools, as the 388th highest-rated school in the country, up 61 places from its 2005 ranking of 449. In 2008 the Columbia Scholastic Press Association awarded gold medals to the Leaves yearbook and the Warrior newspaper.  The theme of the 2008 Leaves was "What Does It Take To Be a Warrior?"A new system of academies has been implemented beginning with the class of 2013. There are four academies that students can choose from: Business and Hospitality, Engineering and Technology, Science, and Arts and Humanities. The academies allow students to specialize in their area of interest. MusicSherwood High School has a music programs, including the annual Rock 'n Roll Revival show, which was established in 1971.  The original concept for the show was conceived by a group of Sherwood students who were inspired after seeing a concert at Madison Square Garden in October 1971. Faculty members also appeared in the first show in 1972.   The show includes the performance of a mix of songs from the late 1950s to the late 1980s. Each March, Rock 'n' Roll Revival has performances over two weekends  at Ertzman Theatre, with a seventh performance for students in area middle and elementary schools.Sherwood High School also has an Instrumental Music Department and offers jazz band, jazz lab, concert band, and symphonic orchestra. The Chambers Chorus performs many times during the year at area venues, and in March 2009 they toured Italy and performed in three different cathedrals in Rome and Tuscany.  Also offered are choruses including jazz choir, show choir, and a women's chorus. AthleticsThe Sherwood Warriors varsity football team has won a several Maryland state championships, including 1995, 1996 and most recently, 2008.  The Warriors also made it to the state finals but lost to Suitland High School in 2006, Damascus High School in 2005, to Parkdale High School in 2002, and to Gaithersburg High School in 2000.   O n December 5, 2008, they defeating Linganore High School 21-3 and won the 4A state title with the first undefeated record in school history at 14-0. The boys soccer team won the 2004 and 2005 Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association championships.  The boys varsity lacrosse team has won several divisional titles, and they won the 2003 regional championship. In the 2008 baseball season, Sherwood was the Maryland 4A State Champions, after finishing runner-up in 2007 to Eleanor Roosevelt High School.  In fall 2003, the boys varsity cross-country team won the state championship for the first time in nearly 25 years. In 2006 they placed second in the state meet. The Sherwood varsity basketball team won the 4A Maryland State Championship, held at the Comcast Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, on March 10, 2007. On February 9, 2008, Warriors' Pom Squad won the Division I-West title. On November 22, 2008, the varsity cheerleaders placed first in the MCPS Cheerleading Competition.

Western Maryland Rail Trail  The Western Maryland Rail Trail (WMRT) is a   long shared-use asphalt-paved rail trail from Fort Frederick to Pearre Station, Maryland, United States, that is suitable for walkers, joggers, bikers, rollerbladers and, weather permitting, cross country skiing and snowshoeing.The trail runs on the abandoned right-of-way of the Western Maryland Railroad. The track was closed in stages. The last train ran through the Indigo Tunnel in 1975 and the last train on any part of track in 1987. In August 1990, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources purchased the right-of-way from 1/2 mile west of Fort Frederick State Park to Little Orleans through Hancock from CSX Transportation. Construction began on the first ten-mile (16 km) section from Fort Frederick to Hancock opened in 1997 and was completed in 1998. The second section, running   from Hancock to Pollypon, a small body of water where canal boats would winter, began in 2001 and opened on June 10, 2002. Construction began on the third section, a   extension from Pollypon to Pearre Station in 2003 and it opened in 2005. An additional   extension to Little Orleans has been funded.  The project is set to begin construction in the summer of 2012.  The $4.6 million planned extension would take the trail to the   Indigo Tunnel, but not through it, because an environmental impact study determined it houses the largest known bat refuge in Maryland.  The tunnel is one of the largest hibernaculum of five species of bats, including the Eastern Small-footed bat and the Indiana bat (both currently listed as endangered) as well as numerous other bats. The trail will instead use the C&O Canal towpath to bypass the tunnel within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. In the longer term, Maryland and West Virginia aspire to extend the trail 10 additional miles to Paw Paw, West Virginia. The extension will cross the Potomac six times and pass through the old Stickpile and Kessler tunnels.

Northwestern High School (Hyattsville, Maryland)    Northwestern High School (NHS) is a public comprehensive secondary school located in Hyattsville, Maryland in Prince George's County, less than a mile from the internationally known University of Maryland, College Park. It is part of the Prince George's County Public Schools system. Two middle schools (Hyattsville Middle School and Nicholas Orem Middle School) feed into Northwestern, as well as twelve elementary schools, which are part of the Northwestern Cluster of Schools.Established in 1951 at its current location off Adelphi Road, the original building was demolished in the Summer of 2000, and a new facility now stands in its place. Opening in August 2000, at   and a capacity of 2,700 students, Garcia, German and Bryant, Kevina. "New Northwestern Ready for 2000!". The Paw Print, October 1999. Page 1.  Northwestern is the second largest high school in the state of Maryland when measured by total square footage, and it became the first of the county's current high schools to be replaced with a new facility.In December 2009, Northwestern was recognized as a Silver Medal School amongst "America's Best High Schools" by U.S. News & World Report.  In 2005, The Washington Post cited Northwestern as being the second highest ranking high school―amongst all district high schools―for students scoring highest on the nationally administered AP tests.    Northwestern is accredited by the Commission on Secondary Schools  which is a division of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.Jim Henson, creator of The Muppets, graduated from Northwestern in 1954.  On 5 October 2002, during an official building dedication ceremony attended by Jane and Heather Henson, as well as representatives from The Jim Henson Legacy, Inc., Northwestern was given permission to rename the D/E/F-Wing at Northwestern, in honor of the late Jim Henson. Jim Henson School of Arts, Media & Communications The Jim Henson Legacy, Inc.     History  About NorthwesternEdgar Batenga is the current principal at Northwestern,  having joined the faculty in the Fall of 2011.  Batenga replaced Jerome Thomas, who was principal from 2004 until July 2011.  Thomas succeeded former principal, William T. Ritter, who was the schools Dean of Students until 2000 when then principal, Kevin M. Maxwell, left the Prince George's County Public Schools system to head Walter Johnson High School,    in Montgomery County. Maxwell is currently serving as superintendent of schools for the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system,  also in Maryland. William Ritter, himself, was eventually appointed head of the Region 5 District in 2004 (and later, head of the school systems FIRST-Financial Incentive Rewards for Supervisors & Teachers program), where Jerome Thomas—who was a longtime vice-principal at Northwestern—took his position.Northwestern houses a branch of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington  and operates an Evening High School  for the Northern half of the county, as well as a Saturday High School program.  Northwestern hosts a very popular Saturday-run "ISP Flea Market" that is sponsored by the school's International Studies Program (ISP). Northwestern is home to the county-wide COLOURS Performing Arts Program  and, it is also the Northern county host school for the annual district High School Band & Orchestra Assessments,  which showcases county bands and orchestras who are adjudicated by renowned music directors from around the country. Northwestern also used to be a host school for the districts' Middle School & High School Chorus Festival, and it is currently used as a secondary site for the Superiors Concert  which is the district festival for all choirs rated superior during county assessments. Northwestern also served as host school for Gateway Music Festival's Washington, DC national choir competition in 2003, and hosted the 2004 Maryland All-State Band Festival. Building and facilities Northwestern Campus (1951-2000)Northwestern Senior High School was founded in 1951 as a public secondary school. Northwestern was the consolidation of three schools: Hyattsville High School, Greenbelt High School, and Mount Rainier High School. Beginning in the 1960s, several additions were added to the original school in different stages, including what was called the "new" art wing. By the year 2000, Northwestern consisted of a long "main wing" with three "wings" branching out like fingers attached to it. These wings were referred to as the A-wing, B-wing, and C-wing. The cafeteria was located at the rear of the school on the second floor and attached to the C-wing.The boys gymnasium, girls auxiliary gymnasium, band, choir, and orchestra rooms, were all located at the rear of the building, as well. The C-wing was accessible to the B-wing by a long suspended enclosed bridge that could only be reached from the second floor. A large field of space was located between wings B & C and was dubbed, "The Senior Courtyard." Originally reserved exclusively for seniors to provide their own special area to converge during their assigned lunch, the Senior Courtyard was eventually opened to the entire student body. Northwestern was one of the few schools to allow students outside during lunch, as most schools didn't have the proper accommodations to allow this. The Justice Memorial Auditorium was another add-on and was part of the A-wing, which was the final addition to the original building. The A-wing was the only section of the old facility that had air conditioning. Northwestern was converted from a grades 10-12 "senior high school" to a grades 9-12 "high school" configuration, in 1981. The new building By the mid-1990s, Northwestern was beginning to show its age. A plan to replace the structure with a brand new $45 million dollar facility was proposed. Prince George's County Public Schools contracted the SHW Group LLP  to design and build the new Northwestern. Construction of the new school began in late summer of 1998, the new facility located directly behind the old building. Students attended classes in the old building while construction of the new facility took place only yards away from the rear of the old school. In fact, the new school was physically connected to the old building at the rear (stage area) of the auditorium. The new building officially opened to students and staff in August 2000, just in time for the new school year, thus becoming the first new high school constructed in Prince George's County since Eleanor Roosevelt High School was completed, back in 1976. While it took two years to construct the new facility, the building was not actually fully completed until midway through the 2001-02 school year. Classes commenced at the new Northwestern before the former facility had been torn down. The large bus lot, which is located directly in front of the new building, and the expansive main parking lot, had yet to be paved prior to the opening of the new building because the old facility stood where these new areas were to be made. In addition, there were a few exterior portions of the new facility which weren't finally constructed to finalize the building, until 2002. Except for the auditorium, which was retained from the old building and completely overhauled and transformed into D-Wing of the new school, the old Northwestern was razed while classes were ongoing in the new building. The main parking lot for the new school lies where the former facility once stood. Northwestern Campus (2000-Present)      At  , Northwestern High School has a capacity of 2,700 students  with a Fall 2011 enrollment of approximately 2,274 students. Northwestern's largest student enrollment was reached during the 2006-2007 school year, in which over 3,000 students were registered. Northwestern had over twenty portable classrooms, to accommodate the over-enrollment. Northwestern had never had portable trailers until, ironically, after the new facility was built. Even though Northwestern's Fall 2011 enrollment is under capacity, the school currently houses twenty portable classrooms, all of which are located at the rear of the facility spanning one end of the building to the other. The additional classroom space is primarily needed to accommodate the expansive course offerings at the school, although, they also serve for slight control of overcrowding.Until 2006, Northwestern was officially the largest high school in Maryland  when measured by square footage, a distinction that has since been given up to the brand new  . Dr. Henry A. Wise, Jr. High School,  located in Southern Prince George's County. However, with Wise having a capacity of 2,600 students and Northwestern having a capacity of 2,700 students, Northwestern is still the largest high school in Prince George's County in terms of building capacity. There was controversy for a time for the distinction of, what was then, "the largest high school in Maryland," between Northwestern and neighboring Montgomery Blair High School in Montgomery County, over which of the two schools was physically larger—in square footage—over the other. Both schools were designed by the same architectural firm, both schools were constructed around the same time (Blair in 1998 and Northwestern in 2000), both schools share a very similar design both internally and externally, and both schools are of similar size. Blair was constructed for   originally and Northwestern for  . Through certain technicalities, Blair's total square footage was upped to around  . But, it was decided that Northwestern—with the addition of its greenhouse to the second floor of the A-Wing in 2001—retains its slightly larger physical size over Blair, despite Blair having a larger maximum student capacity.On the exterior, Northwestern's campus features three courtyards,  all of which are located between the four wings of the building. The school has a total of five parking lots: the large main parking lot (located in front of the facility and in place of where the former facility once stood) which is designated for staff, students, and visitors; another parking lot adjacent to the main parking lot and located in front of the auditorium, which is reserved for staff and students; two smaller parking lots located at the rear of the facility, both of which are reserved for staff or visitors attending athletic events; and a large bus bay capable of accommodating forty-four school buses, which is located directly in front of the facility and also doubles as another parking lot for staff and visitors, during and after the regular school day. The school has six tennis courts located just outside the auditorium to the east of the building and it has several basketball courts located at the rear of the building outside the food court, which have been decommissioned and now serves as an area which houses several of the schools portable classrooms. There are a total of three athletic fields,  all located in the rear of the building: the football/soccer stadium which also encompasses the running track which surrounds the football/soccer field; a softball field, and a baseball field.Northwestern is divided into four distinct "sub-schools" referred to as: the A-Wing, B/G-Wing, C-Wing, and D/E/F-Wing.  Each sub-school can house between 600 to 700 students. The original plan for Northwestern, was to physically divide the school into four smaller schools, hence the design theme of the building. Hummer, Alex. "A New Look at School Registration". The Paw Print, December 1999. Page 1.  Sub-School A was intended to be the "School of Fine, Creative, and Performing Arts"; Sub-School B was to be the "School of Career and Consumer Education"; Sub-School C was to be a general facility that housed mainly elective courses, in addition the schools main offices, security office, and health center; and Sub-School D was to be "The School of Intensive and Specialized Instruction," which would house the schools honors and advanced placement program as well as the schools ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages) program and Vocational Development (Special Education) program.  Students were not to be permitted to interact with students from other sub-schools,  and students from each sub-school were to be isolated within their sub-school, for the majority of the school day.  Due to scheduling conflicts and feasibility issues with this type of sub-school concept, the idea for restrictive sub-schools was dropped before the new building ever opened, while the idea of smaller learning communities was retained and revised to become less restrictive and isolating.The sub-schools are connected by a large, uniquely architectural main hallway called, the skywalk, which features a tiered three-story design. A person overlooking the third floor Skywalk can see straight down to the first floor main hallway. The building features an artistic, colorful design theme using multiple variations of the colors: blue, purple, teal, gray, and white. The colors were inspired largely by the official school colors which are navy blue and white. The four main academic sections of the building house specialized programs as part of Northwestern's initiative to provide smaller learning environments in which students can specialize in specific areas of study, similar to a college. Across the main hallway from the sub-buildings are other facilities encompassing the H, J, & K-Wings (there is no "I-Wing"), which includes the main gymnasium, auxiliary gymnasium, main cafeteria/food court (H-Wing), NJROTC unit and Child Development wing (K-Wing), and library/media center. The H, J, and K-Wings aren't separate buildings like Wings A-F. Another unique design feature of Northwestern, is its three satellite cafeterias or commissary's, which supplement the main food court. There is a commissary in Wings A, B/G, and D/E/F. These commissary's were generally intended for seniors, only, but students for all grade levels use the facilities. Northwestern features three "lecture halls" with stadium seating which resemble classrooms typically found at large universities. These lecture halls can seat 30-50 students. The auditorium—which comprises the entire portion of the building referred to as the D-Wing—has a maximum capacity of 1,100 spectators. Northwestern also has two high capacity elevators that are restricted for personnel use, only. Northwestern in a technologically advanced school and has over six computer labs, in addition to the media center. Northwestern currently has over 1,100 computers, one of the largest of any high school in Maryland. Each classroom at Northwestern has a bank of at least five computers,  all of which have internet access. All of the lavatories at Northwestern feature automatic flush toilets, automatic on/off sinks, and automatic hand dryers. As an energy conservation effort, the lighting in the hallways have an auto-on/off feature, where sensors will automatically shutoff the lights if people movement is not detected within a certain period of time, and conversely will turn-on the lights when people movement is detected. Athletic facilities Northwestern was planned with enhanced emphasis on athletics.  The football and soccer stadium (previously known as the Prince George's County Memorial Stadium) can accommodate the entire student population and features a modern, air-conditioned press box. There are also two softball/baseball fields (one at either side of the football field) and six tennis courts. The new baseball field was dedicated to longtime baseball coach, football coach, gym teacher, athletic director and alumnus Martin "Marty" Gallagher. This honor was organized by Coach Gallagher's former athletes from the 60's, 70's and 80's. The gymnasium is currently the second largest gymnasium in Prince George's County; the facility is able to seat over half the school's population. When the bleachers are retracted, the gymnasium is able to provide three full-sized basketball courts for practice and play. It was widely rumored that the new school was to feature, amongst other things, an indoor swimming pool, but it did not come to fruition for various reasons. Northwestern Health & Wellness CenterThe Health & Wellness Center is a joint venture between Northwestern High School and the Prince George's Hospital Center in Cheverly, Maryland. When the original Health & Wellness Center was founded back in the mid-90s in the old building, it was the first of its kind in PGCPS. Two other centers have since been established, more recently, in other area schools.The Health Center is located across from the Main Administrative Offices (Room C207) and combines the Health and Wellness Center and the Health Suite in one location. The Health and Wellness Center provides basic health, counseling, education and prevention services in support of Northwestern students' academic and social success.    Services include physical examinations,  tests and treatment for infections and transmittable diseases,  immunizations,  gynecological care,  dental care,  and mental health counseling.  All students and infant/toddlers of teen parents enrolled in the Adolescent Teen Parenting Program are eligible to receive confidential primary health care services and treatment. The emphasis is on health promotion, disease prevention and self-care.Services are provided at no direct charge to students or parents/guardians, except when appropriate to bill enrollees insurance company or medical assistance.     The student body EnrollmentAs of Fall 2011, Northwestern High School has an enrollment of approximately 2,274 students.  The demographics of the student body (as of 2009) was 96.5% minority, of which 44.2% are African-American/Black including those from African or Caribbean nations; 45.04% Hispanic; 6.8% Asian; and 3.4 Caucasian.  Of these students, 1270 are male and 1183 are female. Northwestern High School Profile & Statistics, Northwestern High School.  About 400 students are "Limited English Proficient" (LEP) or ESOL School Improvement Plan, Northwestern High School.  and over 200 are in Special Education.  More than half of Northwestern’s students qualify for Free and Reduced Meal (FARM) status.  Feeder patterns and admissions  AdmissionsThere is no admissions process (i.e. pre-entrance examination) for students to attend Northwestern. Students must live in the designated zoned attendance area for Northwestern. In 8th grade, middle school students who will be attending Northwestern freshman year must complete a pre-registration form  which reflects which of the Northwestern academy programs they will be interested in enrolling in. Certain academies have specific requirements that students need to satisfy in order to apply for that program. Communities served by NorthwesternNorthwestern High School serves students from almost all of the city of Hyattsville    and all of the city of Mount Rainier, the towns of Avondale, Brentwood, North Brentwood, and University Park,  and the communities of Lewisdale and West Hyattsville.  Students from portions of the city of College Park, Langley Park, Riverdale Park, and some areas considered to be Adelphi,  also attend Northwestern. It was not until 1965 that Northwestern received its first multi-cultural students who were bused in from the adjacent area of Bladensburg, Maryland. Northwestern feeder schoolsHyattsville is fed directly by Hyattsville Middle School and Nicholas Orem Middle School, both of which are located in Hyattsville.  Elementary schools which feed into Northwestern include Carole Highlands, César Chávez, Chillum, Hyattsville, Lewsidale, Mount Rainier, Rosa L. Parks, Ridgecrest, Riverdale, Thomas S. Stone, and University Park.  Dress code  In 2005, Northwestern was the first high school in Prince George's County to implement a mandatory school uniform policy. Northwestern High School Uniform Policy  Academics  Sub-schools and academy programsAs part of adopting a "smaller learning communities" program of instruction, Northwestern High School offers several specialized programs in addition to the core curriculum mandated by the Prince George's County Public Schools system. 2008-2009 Northwestern High School Course Guide. Northwestern Guidance Department. Pages 5-8.  A career academy operates as a "school-within-a-school" model, that provides a college preparatory curriculum with a career-related theme. The curriculum organizes instruction in academic subjects around an industry or career theme and enables students to fulfill requirements for college entrance in addition to acquiring work-related knowledge and skill.All students are provided a core set or curricula and experiences in the ninth and tenth grades. Ninth graders will become a part of the Ninth Grade Academy to provide greater structure and focus with the goal of enhancing basic skills and preparing them for more intensive study after their selection of a career academy by the end of sophomore year. During the eleventh and twelfth grades, students will be exposed to more specific or specialized instruction and participate in various work-based learning experiences. Since all students take a "core foundation" of academic courses, career pathways overlap enough to allow the flexibility to change academies, if interests change or new knowledge and skills are acquired.Northwestern has identified nine career clusters,    which are organized around broad career fields. Of the nine career clusters, Northwestern has implemented four sub-schools.    Each wing at Northwestern hosts at least one sub-school and one or more "academy programs." The various programs are:   The Jim Henson School of Arts, Media, and Communications  Academy of Arts & Humanities  Academy of Vocal Music  Academy of Instrumental Music  Academy of Visual Arts  School of Business Management and Finance  Academy of Business Management  National Academy of Finance  School of Human Resource Services  International Studies Program (ISP)  NJROTC Academy of Military Science  School of Manufacturing, Engineering, and Technology  Project Lead the Way Academy of Engineering   Northwestern also features the America's Choice School Design Signature Program, a whole-school program which promotes reading and the language arts.  Academy of Arts, Media & CommunicationsThe Jim Henson School of Arts, Media, and Communications offers academies in three arts disciplines: Arts & Humanities, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts.  The school was granted the exclusive rights to use Jim Henson's name, by the family of Mr. Henson.  The school is the largest sub-school at Northwestern. Students enrolled in the Jim Henson School, receive extensive instruction in either: vocal music, instrumental music, general music, drama, journalism, dance, fine arts, and television production, or a combination of the arts disciplines.  The vocal and instrumental music programs at Northwestern, as well as the Advanced Placement Art program, have collectively received numerous awards throughout the years for their work.  Project Lead the Way Academy of Engineering (PLTW/AOE)The Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Academy of Engineering (AOE) educates high school students in the principles of engineering,    and provides content in the fields of electronics, biotechnology, aerospace, civil engineering, and architecture.  The Academy of Engineering is a partnership with Project Lead The Way, Inc. (PLTW) and The STEM Academy.  The program is a four-year sequence of courses which, when combined with traditional mathematics and science courses in high school, introduces students to the scope, rigor and discipline of engineering prior to entering college.    Students in the Academy of Engineering take specialized courses, specific to the academy, such as:  Principles of Engineering; Introduction to Engineering Design; and Digital Electronics.  Specialization Courses include: Computer Integrated Manufacturing; Biotechnical Engineering; Civil Engineering and Architecture; Aerospace Engineering; and Capstone Course: Engineering Design and Development.  Academy of Finance (AOF)The National Academy of Finance (AOF) is an academy program that connects high school students with the world of financial services, offering a curriculum that covers banking and credit, financial planning, international finance, securities, insurance, accounting, and economics.    The AOF is a national program that was established to develop students with the skills and knowledge to succeed in this fast-paced growth area of business.    The NJROTC Academy of Military ScienceThe Naval Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NJROTC) Academy of Military Science,    provides secondary school students the opportunity to become informed, responsible citizens prepared for high school graduation.  Program highlight include: a focus on academics including United States military history;  exploration of national security issues;  the study of meteorology and astronomy;  communications and advanced technologies employed by the Armed Services;  navigation and survival skills;  healthy lifestyles and physical fitness;  organizational skills and financial management;  career exploration in a wide variety of fields (both military and nonmilitary) and the foundations of responsible leadership.  Cadets learn and continue to develop leadership skills and application of military courtesies and customs as they complete each year of their NJROTC programs.  The curriculum is structured for success in high school and beyond.  Through the demonstration of discipline, honor, self-respect, and commitment cadets gain increasing responsibilities within their programs.  NJROTC cadets and units must complete civic action projects and community service.  The program also provides field trips to historical military sites and institutions;  visits to colleges/universities and military academies to increase awareness and opportunities;  and participation on one of the various Drill Teams could include travels to neighboring counties, states, and possibly to competitions held nationwide.  The programs provide college scholarships and Military Academy appointment opportunities for qualified cadets.  With the completion of specific requirements, several courses within the NJROTC curriculum can earn cadets college credits through the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.  Students who successfully complete a minimum of three years of the NJROTC program and qualify to enter the active duty military service, receive pay/rank increases of two grades above non-NJROTC recruits.  International Studies AcademyThe International Studies Academy (also known as The International Studies Program) at Northwestern High School, is an interdisciplinary honors program    which affords students the opportunity to choose a curriculum offering a focus in global education and technology.  ISP students are also strongly encouraged to participate in international travel.  This component of the ISP greatly enhances participating students’ understanding of their world and enriches their ability to interact successfully with a broad range of peoples and regions.  Similarly, the experiences offered within ISP reinforce students’ capacity for viewing career paths in technology-related professions,  as well as in foreign policy,  international affairs  and foreign exchange.  General AcademicsNorthwestern students generally undertake a college preparatory curriculum that follows the graduation requirement guidelines set forth by the state of Maryland,    that includes: four years of English; three years of mathematics, science, and social studies (U.S. History, L/S/N Government, and World History are required); one credit in fine arts and Foundations of Technology; and a ½ credit of Personal Fitness (Physical Education) and Health.  There are variety of completer electives a student must choose from, as well as a combination of ways they can earn those elective credits. Two credits of a foreign language (both credits must be of the same language) are required, as well as three additional credits is miscellaneous electives.  Optionally, a student may elect to complete two credits in Advanced Technology Education and three credits in miscellaneous electives.  As another option, a student could complete a state-approved technology program and any remaining credits in electives. Northwestern students can also choose from 20 Advanced Placement courses, with at least one AP course offered in every major humanities discipline.   Northwestern students enrolled in the School of Business Management have a variety of completer courses to choose from. Academy of Finance electives include: Introduction to Financial Services 1/2; Banking & Credit; Business Law; College Accounting; Introduction to Investment & Insurance; Financial Planning; International Finance; Economics & World of Finance; Computer Applications; and Advanced Accounting.    Academy of Business Management electives include: Entrepreneurship 1 and Entrepreneurship 2 courses.

Northwestern students enrolled in the PLTW Academy of Engineering can choose from a variety of completer courses such as: Introduction to Engineering Design; Principles of Engineering; Digital Electronics; Civil Engineering & Architecture; and Engineering Design & Development. There are a host of other academy-specific electives offered at Northwestern such as: Career Research & Development courses; NJROTC courses; Child Growth & Development courses; Television Production courses; and Computer Graphics courses. Northwestern offers foreign language course offerings in French, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish.    Advanced Placement foreign language offerings include AP French Language 5, AP Italian Language and Culture, AP Japanese Language and Culture, AP Spanish Language 5, AP Spanish Literature 6. Students interested in computer graphics can choose from courses such as Computer Graphics 1, Computer Graphics 2, and AP Computer Graphics. Northwestern students are required to complete a biology course before graduation.  Non-traditional science courses include: Integrating the Sciences; Anatomy & Physiology;  Microbiology; Introduction to Environmental Relationships & Problems; Plants & People; Forensic Lab Science 1/2; and Medical Science. There are a wide array of electives offered in the humanities, which include: African American Studies; African Area Studies; Drama; Economic Issues; Practical Law; Journalism/Yearbook; Psychology; Public Policy Issues; SAT Preparation; Social Studies Research Seminar; and Student Government.  Northwestern's award-winning music program offers students twelve performance ensembles ranging from Marching Band and Steel Drum Band to Concert Choir.  There are non-performance elective courses offered such as Music Survey, Musicianship and AP Music Theory.  Release-time/work study programNorthwestern has three groups of 12th grade students that have an abbreviated class schedule.  Most of these students take two classes per day before leaving school.  These groups include:  Released Time students  Marketing Work Study students  COE/Government Connection Work Study students.   Released Time students are allowed to leave school prior to the end of the normal school day to pursue a non-credit program of activities approved but not sponsored or supervised by the school.  Most of these students leave after their second period class.  While released time students have school privileges, such as participation in athletic and other extracurricular activities, they must exit the school building at the conclusion of their normal day and return at the time their scheduled activity begins.  The Guidance Counselors discuss the terms of release time with students, and the students and their parents must complete the necessary paperwork for students to be on released time. Marketing Work Study students are seniors participating in the Marketing Completer program.  These students take their scheduled classes and, in most cases, are dismissed from school at the end of second period.  These students are not permitted to leave school before the conclusion of their second period class.  While these students have jobs, their work schedules should not conflict with their normal school day. The Cooperative Office Experience (COE)/Government Connection Work Study students participate in a school sponsored work-based learning experience in partnership with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington, DC.  Students must report to their work site by a specified time.  Prince George's County school buses transport these students to the Prince George's Plaza Metro Station.  Advanced Placement program rankingsNorthwestern High School was cited in The Washington Post for its achievements in its Advanced Placement (AP) program, for 2005. Northwestern was ranked second in the county (out of 24 high schools) for students scoring highest on the nationally administered Advanced Placement Tests,  by College Board, the association which governs AP programs and its related courses throughout the country.In January 2006, the College Board reported that 17.9% of Northwestern's 2005 graduates earned a passing score of 3 or higher  (the highest being a 5) which is above the national average of 14.1%.  This achievement ranked Northwestern behind only the county's leading high school, Eleanor Roosevelt,  which has consistently ranked first in the county due largely in part to its specialized, Science and Technology Center magnet program.  This was the first time that Northwestern had achieved this distinction.Northwestern offers one of the largest AP programs in Prince George's County, offering courses such as AP Calculus, AP Physics, AP U.S. History, AP English Literature, AP Studio Art, and AP Spanish, just to name a few. Northwestern's rating of 17.9% surpasses the national average of 14.1%.  Northwestern's closest contender in the county is academically notable, Bowie High School, which received a rating of 13.2%.    Center for the Visual & Performing Arts magnet programIn 2003, Northwestern was slated (by former school district superintendent Iris T. Metts) to become a "Center for the Visual and Performing Arts" (VPA) Magnet School  in the Fall of 2004, for the northern area of the county. This decision was based largely on (1) the new building and its huge fine/performing arts wing, (2) the tremendous successes of NHS's award-winning choirs, bands, and orchestra, and (3) feeder school Hyattsville Middle becoming a "Creative and Performing Arts" Magnet that same year. This announcement was made during the official naming ceremony for the schools D/E/F Building in honor of Jim Henson.  Northwestern would have joined Suitland High School in the Southern part of the county as a VPA Magnet School.However, the addition of the VPA Magnet at Northwestern has been delayed indefinitely. This delay was partly due to severe budget constraints on the school system. Further, the system under Metts' successor, Dr. Andre J. Hornsby, faced increasing pressure from the state to overhaul the county's hallmark magnet programs, which were created in the 1980s by a court mandate to end racial segregation in Prince George's County schools, since racial segregation was ruled no longer an issue in the now predominantly African-American county. Since 2004, Northwestern has still been actively pursing having a performing arts magnet program, implemented within the school. There has been no official public announcement as to when or if the school will ever gain an arts magnet program. University of Maryland Collaborative Project magnet programDuring the 1990s and extending into the beginning of the 21st century, Northwestern housed the University of Maryland Collaborative Project continuation magnet program, Prince George's County Public Schools. "University of Maryland Collaborative Project", Magnet Schools 1999-2004, 10 October 2012.  for students who were enrolled in a middle school Science, Mathematics, and Technology Magnet Program, primarily serving students from the magnet at Nicholas Orem Middle School.  The educational programs within the magnet were also open to all attendance-area students at Northwestern.  It was a highly-challenging program that had as its focus and objective, the preparation of students to achieve success in Advanced Placement courses  and for entry into college.  The magnet included differentiated instruction and a competency-based curriculum.  The magnet program served as an educational partnership linking the personnel and resources of the University of Maryland, College Park and Northwestern.  Students had access to Pre-Advanced Placement courses and Advanced Placement Government at the ninth grade level;  major emphasis on analytical writing in English classes,  computer-intensive mathematics classes;  scientific research in trigonometry and calculus classes;  and a host of other magnet exclusive instructional methods.  Due to the court-ordered restructuring of PGCPS magnet programs, several magnets were eliminated in between 2003 and 2004, including the programs at Northwestern and Nicholas Orem.  Extracurricular activities  BandThe Northwestern High School Instrumental Music Program has been rated superior and received first place, as well as grand championship rankings, at local, state, and national levels. Also went to Nationals ( event for best bands in the country). ChoirThe vocal music program has become a nationally and internationally recognized program, that consists of five performance ensembles, which include: the Concert Choir (Full Chorus), Advanced Ensemble, Women's Chorale, Encore!, and Gospel Choir. The Concert, Advanced, Women's, and Gospel Choirs, have all received numerous superior ratings at the local and state level, as well as national and international venues.    In the Fall of 2010, the Choir formed the Friends of the Northwestern Choral Society (FNCS), which is a legal non-profit organization, that serves as the managerial and operating division of the Choir.  The FNCS is primarily responsible for the fundraising endeavors of the Choir, managing the Choirs expenditures and finances, and promoting the Choir and its events. The largest choir has typically been the Concert Choir.  Enrollment in this Choir has been as high as 130-members in the past.  Currently, the Concert Choir has approximately 100-members.  The vocal music program at Northwestern is not considered extra-curricular. All Choirs at Northwestern are offered as credit courses during the academic school day. The Concert Choir is the beginning to intermediate-level choir and the main vocal performing group at Northwestern, for students in grades nine through twelve.  All choristers are members of the ensemble. There is an open-enrollment for the Concert Choir. Students sing many genres of music such as: classical, spiritual, international, secular, sacred, jazz, and show tunes.  The Choir has performed classical works from Mozart and Schubert to challenging spirituals from William L. Dawson and Moses Hogan. The Advanced Ensemble is a select choir of approximately 65-students in Grades 9-12, and is the primary touring/performing choir. Members are either hand-selected or auditioned from the main Concert Choir, for participation.  The Advanced Ensemble performs music of the same genre, as the main Concert Choir, but the music tends to be more challenging, including more foreign language repertoire.  The Advanced Choir travels and performs the most extensively of all the performing groups. The Gospel Choir is currently taught as an after-school ensemble. The Gospel Choir has performed gospel music works from contemporary gospel greats such as Kirk Franklin, Hezekiah Walker, and Donnie McClurkin.  The Women's Choir is a beginning to intermediate-level, all-female SSA ensemble. This group is the equivalent of the main Concert Choir. Encore! is a new a cappella jazz tunes and pop variety choir, formed from members of the Advanced Ensemble. Encore! performs at the more prestigious events the choirs are requested to participate in.The Choirs participate yearly in nationwide and international choral competitions, consistently bringing home multiple 1st place/Superior honors for eight of the last twelve years.  The Concert Choir recently was awarded the highest honors, a "Superior" rating, at the 2011 Festival of Gold invitational in New York City.  The entire Choir and several Choir alumni members, have been invited overseas to participate in a the prestigious Ihlombe! South African Festival, a 10-day concert tour of South Africa, in 2013.     The choirs have also had a prominent presence at the state-level, Maryland All-State Chorus Festival. The Choirs have been featured on the national television network, NBC;  a PBS network broadcast special, Celebrate America with Tim Janis;  the University of Maryland television network;  and have performed with the Towson State University Choir and the University of Maryland Chamber Singers.  The Choirs have performed two world premiers—Many Voices, One World with original poetry by Northwestern students  and Undisclosed Locations  with Northwestern's award-winning Jazz Band. Both collaboration projects were in conjunction with the University of Maryland School of Music, with songs written exclusively for the Choir by the late composer, Christopher Patton.

Aberdeen High School (Aberdeen, Maryland)   Aberdeen High School is a public high school in Aberdeen, Maryland.The school is a part of the Harford County Public Schools. Test PerformanceAberdeen High School's performance on the Maryland High School Assessment test is close to equivalent to the state average.  In algebra, the average proficiency was 3.1 out of five, the same as the average in the state.  In English, the average proficiency was 2.9 out of five, while the state's average proficieny was 3.0.   Science and Mathematics AcademyThe Science and Mathematics Academy (SMA) is a magnet program located at Aberdeen High School in Aberdeen, Maryland available to Harford County residents entering high school with high academic achievement.       It was founded in 2004 by its first coordinator Donna Clem and in association with Dennis Kirkwood.  The school is an active member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology and part of Harford County Public Schools.      School Information"The program provides students with the opportunity to experience challenging coursework in science, mathematics, and technology with an emphasis on research applications. Regular  with practicing scientists and mathematicians is a cornerstone of the program and seniors will complete a capstone project of original research under the mentorship of professionals in their chosen area of investigation."  Classes and ProgramsWithin the SMA schedule, many honors classes are integrated.  These classes include Honors English 9, Honors English 10, Advance Placement Government 9, Honors Biology, Honors Earth Science, Honors Chemistry, Honors Physics, and Honors Algebra II.  A.P. classes are also strongly encouraged including A.P. World History, A.P. U.S. History, A.P. English 11, A.P. English 12, a required A.P. Math (A.P. Calculus AB, A.P. Statistics), and a required A.P. Science (A.P. Biology, A.P. Chemistry, A.P. Environmental, A.P. Physics).Electives in the SMA also add to the program's uniqueness.  Electives are based on interest and may not be available every year.  The SMA electives in previous years have included Astrophysics, Bacteriology, Biotechnology, Computer Aided Drafting and Design (C.A.D.D.), Cryptology, Design Engineering and Patents, Ecology, Forensic Chemistry, Fundamentals of Kinesiology, Genetics, Linear Algebra, Materials Science, Mathematical Logic, Microcontrollers with Application of Fuzzy Logic, Organic Chemistry, Plant Physiology (proposed), Principles of Engineering, Robotics, and Sports Physiology.

The first three years of the SRT curriculum teach students about various academic fields and prepare them for their fourth and final year of SRT, in which they complete capstone projects.     Students are paired with professionals in their fields of choice to mentor them for their projects.  Seniors have two one and a half hour long periods every other school day to complete their projects, which they present at the end of the year.  They make posters to present their projects to the students, teachers, family, and professionals that come to the gallery walk that is held near the end of the school year.    Throughout the process they have to perform research, write papers, and present their projects multiple times.  All qualified Aberdeen High students can take part in the SMA Electives listed in the previous paragraph, but only SMA students can take SRT.

Allegany College of Maryland  Allegany College of Maryland (or ACM) is a two-year public community college located in Cumberland, Maryland. It was previously known as Allegany Community College (or ACC). HistoryAllegany College of Maryland began operations in 1961 as "Allegany Community College" in an old public school facility (the segregationist era all-black Carver Community School) that had been closed by the Allegany County Board of Education. The College opened with an enrollment of 122 students from Allegany County. In 1969, the College moved to a new campus consisting of seven buildings on a 316 acre (1.3 km²) tract in suburban Cumberland that was partially funded by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Enrollment reached the 1000 mark in credit programs during the first year on the new campus and community service and continuing education courses and programs began. Since that time, the campus has expanded to include 15 buildings, which provide modern facilities for both credit and non-credit students.The College opened two Pennsylvania campuses in 1989 (Somerset County Campus in Somerset, Pennsylvania) and 1990 (Bedford County Campus in Everett, Pennsylvania). It expanded its Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts programs into the Gateway Center located in downtown Cumberland in 2002. The College now serves over 3,700 credit students and over 15,000 continuing education registrations. Over 1,000 of these credit students are served at the Pennsylvania campuses. ProgramsThe College offers over 53 associate degrees, 23 certificates, and 21 letters of recognition. AthleticsThe College's men's baseball and basketball teams have been consistently ranked in the top 20 of their respective National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Divisions. The baseball team participated in the NJCAA national tournaments nine times, including a four-year run from 1994-1997. The men's basketball team has participated twelve times in the NJCAA national tournament in 1995-96 (finished 2nd), 1997–98, 2000–01 (finished 2nd), 2001–02, 2003–04 and 2007–08.  GovernanceThe Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) oversees and coordinates higher education in the State of Maryland including academic and financial policies at the College. An eight member Board of Trustees, appointed by the Governor of the State of Maryland, governs the College. The College also has an advisory board for each of its two Pennsylvania Campuses—the Bedford County Campus Advisory Committee and the Somerset County Campus Advisory Committee. The college is a member of the Maryland Association of Community Colleges (MACC). AccreditationThe College is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education, Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104-2680; 215-662-5606. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education is an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The College is also accredited and approved for operation by the Maryland Higher Education Commission. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has granted certification to Allegany College of Maryland campuses in Bedford and Somserset counties and to the academic programs they offer.

U.S. Route 50 in Maryland    U.S. Route 50 (US 50) is a major east–west route of the U.S. Highway system, stretching just over   from Ocean City, Maryland on the Atlantic Ocean to West Sacramento, California. In the U.S. state of Maryland, US 50 exists in two sections. The longer of these serves as a major route connecting Washington, D.C. with Ocean City; the latter is the eastern terminus of the highway. The other section passes through the southern end of Garrett County for less than   as part of the Northwestern Turnpike, entering West Virginia at both ends. One notable section of US 50 is the dual-span Chesapeake Bay Bridge across Chesapeake Bay, which links central Maryland with the Eastern Shore region, allowing motorists to reach the beaches of Ocean City and Delaware.  US 50 has received numerous upgrades during its existence in Maryland, including the building of the John Hanson Highway (which is also the unsigned Interstate 595), its extension onto the Eastern Shore and replacement of U.S. Route 213 due to the construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and the full dualization of the eastern segment of the route. Many of the older alignments of US 50 are still part of the Maryland and US highway systems, such as U.S. Route 50 Business in Salisbury, Maryland. US 50 continues to be upgraded on the Eastern Shore to better accommodate beach travelers and locals alike. Route description George Washington HighwayUS 50 leaves Preston County in West Virginia and enters the state of Maryland in Garrett County.  US 50 is routed along the old Northwestern Turnpike, presently named George Washington Highway after George Washington.  This section of US 50 is a quiet, rural highway with little traffic, which stands in sharp contrast to the other, longer section.  US 50 intersects only two numbered highways along this stretch: US 219 in Red House, and MD 560 east of there.Near the West Virginia community of Gormania, US 50 crosses the Potomac River and exits Maryland.  It then passes through West Virginia, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, before reentering Maryland.===John Hanson Highway===     US 50 exits the District as the John Hanson Highway, a freeway alignment extended from the east end of New York Avenue in Prince George's County.  It instantly interchanges with the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at a hybrid interchange with a full cloverleaf and partial-Y elements.  The B-W Parkway also allows access to MD 201 (Kenilworth Avenue).  MD 450, a former alignment of US 50, runs parallel to the highway to the north for the entire trip between the District of Columbia and Annapolis.  The freeway parallels the Orange Line of the Washington Metro and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor as it weaves through the suburban area, interchanging with MD 202 (Landover Road) and MD 410 (Veterans Parkway).  It passes over the Orange Line and the Northeast Corridor before meeting a hybrid turbine interchange with Interstates 95 and 495, the Capital Beltway.East of the Beltway, US 50 enters the Interstate Highway System as the unsigned I-595.  The route is 10 lanes wide; beyond the MD 704 interchange, it narrows to eight lanes, with the innermost two being HOV lanes.  Up to and slightly beyond the US 301/MD 3 interchange, the road surface is concrete; the roadway beyond there is asphalt.  Within the US 301 interchange, the HOV lanes that began at the Capital Beltway come to an end, and US 301 joins US 50 and I-595, forming a three-route concurrency.The central portion of the route runs through undeveloped forest and parkland, meeting MD 424 (Davidsonville Road) three miles (5 km) east of US 301.  After meeting Interstate 97 at a directional-T interchange, the carriageways from I-97 straddle US 50 for a short distance before becoming MD 665, continuing toward downtown Annapolis as a direct freeway spur.The route now runs through the Annapolis urban area where it meets MD 450 (West Street), which leads into downtown Annapolis, and MD 2 (Solomons Island Road), which joins the highway.  Continuing southeast, the highway (now a four-route concurrency of US 50, US 301, I-595 and MD 2) eventually reaches the MD 70 (Rowe Boulevard) interchange, where I-595 silently terminates. Blue Star Memorial HighwayUS 50 now becomes a Blue Star Memorial Highway, bearing this as its official name past MD 70.  The route utilizes the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge to cross the Severn River and interchanges with the eastern end of MD 450 (Governor Ritchie Highway).  This interchanges also releases MD 2 from the concurrency, which continues Governor Ritchie Highway northward to Baltimore.  The US 50/US 301 freeway passes through a heavily wooded area, interchanging with few routes and offering rest stops along its final stretch through the Western Shore region.  The freeway then interchanges with Oceanic Road, which passes over the toll plaza for the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.Officially the William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge, the bridge connects Sandy Point on the Western Shore with Kent Island on the Eastern Shore, raising US 50 and US 301 over two shipping channels marked by the suspension and through-truss spans of the structure.  The bridge's asymmetrical dual spans are also a point of traffic congestion.  The bridge brings the two routes down on Kent Island, and shortly after it meets MD 8 (Romancoke Road) at a diamond interchange.  The freeway portion on the island continues, interchanging with many streets with sharp right-in/right-out ramps, until it meets the Kent Narrows Bridge, raising the routes over the Kent Narrows and bringing them down on the Eastern Shore's mainland.Most of the interchanges along the final stretch of the freeway give access to Maryland Route 18, which parallels US 50/US 301 as a local route and a former alignment of the highway.  After interchanging with Nesbit Road at another diamond interchange and approaching Queenstown, development ceases, and US 50 and US 301 separate at a half-trumpet interchange.  US 301 continues straight along the carriageways, retaining the Blue Star Memorial Highway designation all the way to the Delaware state line.  US 50 exits the highway, turning south as the Ocean Gateway. Queen Anne's County The Ocean Gateway name for US 50 is retained mostly for the remainder of its routing, changing only twice more for short distances.  Continuing east from the US 50 and US 301 split, the highway becomes a four-lane, dual highway and immediately intersects MD 18 (Main Street) for the last time.  It continues through open farmland, bearing southeast as it passes the northern terminus of MD 662 (Wye Mills Road) and MD 213, both former alignments of the highway, which surround Chesapeake College.  US 50 then makes a curve, aiming almost perfectly south as it meets MD 404 (Shore Highway), which forms the Queen Anne's–Talbot border. Talbot County US 50 continues to be signed as east–west, although it follows a north–south path.  MD 662 weaves back and forth across this alignment through open farmlands in Talbot County as it approaches Easton, sometimes merging with it as well.  North of Easton, MD 322 (Easton Parkway) leaves US 50 to the west, which functions as a bypass of the town.  US 50 passes east of the center of town, the speed limit dropping from   to   as it passes through the commercial sector.  Outside of town, the speed limit returns to  , and MD 322 meets US 50 again.  MD 565 silently joins US 50 at this intersection, running concurrent for a short distance and exiting at Old Trappe Road.  MD 565 is another former alignment of US 50, possessing the residential development in the southern Talbot area.  US 50 continues by Trappe, meeting the southern end of MD 565 before continuing to the Choptank River. Dorchester CountyUS 50 then passes over the Senator Frederick C. Malkus Bridge and enters Cambridge and Dorchester County, the speed limit once again dropping to  , as the route starts bearing east once more.  The entirety of US 50 in the city of Cambridge is named Sunburst Highway; this name is carried until the corporate boundaries at Woods Road.  Here, the route's name returns to The Ocean Gateway, and later it intersects MD 16 (Church Creek Road), which travels with US 50 for a short while until East New Market, where it leaves to the north as Mount Holly Road.  From here, US 50 travels through mostly rural countryside in Dorchester County with several loops of older alignments of US 50 crossing the highway.  As it dodges around Vienna on the Nanticoke River, the route intersects Old Route 50 as a direct spur into the town.  This road, formerly US 50 and then formerly MD 731, was the original crossing of the Nanticoke River, utilizing a drawbridge, until 1991.  US 50 then interchanges with MD 331 (Rhodesdale–Vienna Road) at a partial cloverleaf and rises onto the Nanticoke Memorial Bridge, passing over the Nanticoke River. Wicomico CountyUS 50 then enters Wicomico County, and soon after passes by Mardela Springs.  As it does so, it intersects MD 313 (Main Street)/MD 54 (Delmar Road).  The route continues through open farmland in a general southeastern alignment, passing by Hebron and MD 347 (Quantico Road) and MD 670 (East Lillian Street), both of which grant access.  Northwest of Salisbury, US 50 becomes the Salisbury Bypass, a freeway bypass forming a 3/4 beltway around the city.  US 50 Business, which goes directly through downtown Salisbury and is a former alignment of US 50, exits at a partial-Y interchange.  The Salisbury Bypass soon after interchanges with Naylor Mill Road, providing missing movements from the US 50 Business split.  The Bypass passes through the Northwood business park on an earthen viaduct within the city limits, interchanging partially with Northwood Drive to grant access.  Soon after this, US 50 interchanges with US 13/US 13 Business (Salisbury Boulevard), picking up a concurrency with mainline US 13.The two routes circle the city to the northeast and eventually meet US 50 Business at a partial cloverleaf.  Here, US 50 leaves the Bypass, bearing east along a wide four-lane, divided alignment; US 13 continues southward, alone, on the Salisbury Bypass.  US 50 passes by the campus of Wor-Wic Community College and continues through woods and farmland once more, intersecting various routes as it parallels MD 346 (Old Ocean City Road) and bypasses Parsonsburg, Pittsville, and Willards, until it crosses the Pocomoke River, where the route leaves the county. Worcester County  MD 610 (Whaleyville Road) intersects US 50 just beyond the border, bound for Whaleyville.  Shortly after, MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) branches off to the north, bypassing the town of Berlin and bearing toward northern Ocean City.  Past this interchange, MD 346 crosses US 50 and heads into downtown Berlin.  US 50 passes north of Berlin, where it meets a full cloverleaf interchange with US 113 (Worcester Highway).  US 50 and two ramps cross the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, which parallels US 113, at-grade.  The route meets the eastern terminus of MD 346 and continues through the heavily developed West Ocean City, with MD 707, yet another former alignment, paralleling and weaving across the highway.  MD 589 (Racetrack Road) also intersects the route, which leads to Ocean Pines.  Just before the bridge, MD 611 (Stephen Decatur Highway) intersects the route, bound south for Assateague Island and the Ocean City Municipal Airport.  US 50 finally passes over the Sinepuxent Bay on the Harry W. Kelly Memorial Bridge, touching down in the town of Ocean City, where U.S. Route 50 meets its national eastern terminus.Although the route's ceremonial eastern terminus is at MD 528 (Philadelphia Avenue), eastbound US 50 actually continues beyond MD 528 as North Division Street and ends at MD 378 (Baltimore Avenue), a short distance from the Atlantic Ocean and Ocean City Boardwalk.  As with most long-distance U.S. Routes and Interstate highways, a sign displaying the distance to its opposite terminus in Sacramento, California is posted; however, the measurement of 3,073 miles, shared on California's end of US 50, is outdated. HistoryWhile the portion of US 50 in Garrett County has remained largely unchanged, the eastern portion has changed significantly since the route was established in 1926. Original 1926 planOn the Western Shore, US 50 was on the alignment currently known as MD 450.  It ended at Church Circle in Annapolis, near St. Anne's Church.     Beyond the end of US 50 was a ferry which connected the route to what was then Maryland Route 17 on the Eastern Shore, in Talbot County. Extension to the Eastern Shore  Just before the Chesapeake Bay Bridge's completion, in 1948, the route was extended to Ocean City.  This extension brought the route across the bay via an existing ferry service, and US 50 replaced much of US 213 and portions of MD 404 on the Eastern Shore.  As a result of US 50 being routed onto the Eastern Shore, US 213 north of what is now US 50 was removed from the U.S. Highway system, and became the current MD 213 by the late 1970s.  Once the original two-lane span of the bridge was completed in 1952, it replaced the ferry, which had been in service since the 1930s.The John Hanson Highway, named for John Hanson, was the first section of US 50 to be upgraded to a freeway in Maryland.  It was completed soon after the Bay Bridge was built, and the older alignment was redesignated MD 450.  A slight extension of MD 450 was then built to reconnect it with US 50 near the present-day intersection with MD 2. Dualization of US 50High volumes of beach traffic as a result of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge made further upgrades to the route necessary.  A very straight alignment south through Talbot County was built, the former alignment becoming MD 662.  In Salisbury, US 50 was moved from Main Street to Church Street.  In Worcester County, its present-day alignment was built, though only dualized east of US 113 in Berlin.  Following this, in the mid-1960s, the present four-lane section of US 50 was completed between Salisbury at then-US 13 and Berlin at US 113, its old alignment east of East Main Street becoming MD 346, and Church Street was returned to the city.  The rest of US 50 on the Eastern Shore was in the process of being dualized at this time.  This included the adjacent span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge built in 1973, widening the thoroughfare to an asymmetrical five lanes.In 1991, just as the final two-lane section of US 50 was falling into severe disrepair, Vienna was bypassed to the northeast, completing the dualization of the eastern section of US 50.  The drawbridge was then dismantled, and portions of the old road were designated MD 731.  The designations have been rolled back over time, however, and MD 731 is no longer signed.  The 1990s also saw two extra lanes added to the John Hanson Highway in both directions as it was upgraded to enter the Interstate Highway System, being granted the Interstate 595 designation.  However, the Interstate 595 shields were never installed on the highway; although the sign gantries installed during the upgrade contain space for the I-595 shields to be installed, this never happened to prevent motorist confusion, and as a result the designation is only used internally.     The freeway portion was extended to the Eastern Shore, from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge east to the US 50/301 split in Queenstown.  The US 50/301 portion of the Blue Star Memorial Highway was upgraded to a freeway mostly during the late 1980s and early 1990s; prior to this it was only a divided highway with several local roads intersecting it.  After being upgraded, many of these intersections became sharp right-in/right-out ramps.The most recent upgrade to US 50 came in October 2002, when the Salisbury Bypass was extended to circle the north side of the city.  US 50 was rerouted onto this, and the alignment within the city, already bypassed numerous times, became present-day US 50 Business. FutureThere are currently plans to upgrade US 50 in Queen Anne's County to a full limited access freeway, the freeway portion ending at an interchange with Maryland Route 404 atop the Queen Anne's/Talbot County border.  This comes along with plans to fully dualize the latter highway in the state of Maryland.

Woodland, Maryland   Woodland is a small unincorporated community located in Allegany County, Maryland, U.S. about three miles outside of Frostburg. Woodland feeds directly into another community called Klondike. It started as a coal town sometime around the beginning of the 20th century. Many years ago, the town had a community church and a convenience store. Both buildings have since been converted into residences. Woodland is not incorporated as a town, legally, due to its lack of an operational post office or any sort of municipal government.

Annapolis High School (Maryland)    Annapolis High School is an American high school located in the Parole census-designated place in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, near Annapolis.   It is part of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. HistoryFounded in 1896,      Annapolis High was the first public high school to open in Anne Arundel County and among the first in the state of Maryland. The school originally occupied a brick building in historic, downtown Annapolis, but the post-World War I population surge led to the construction of a new school that stood on the outskirts of downtown Annapolis within a short distance from Wiley H. Bates "Colored" High School. In the mid-1960s — more than a decade after the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education — Annapolis High and Bates High were desegregated.   Soon thereafter, the Wiley H. Bates High School was renamed/repurposed into Annapolis Middle School for grades 9 and 10 in 1966-67, and then into Bates Junior High School for grades 7 to 9 in 1968.  The original Wiley H. Bates High School building at 1101 Smithville Street served as a public school until early 1981 when Bates Middle School moved to the former Annapolis Senior High School campus. In 1979, Annapolis High moved to its present location on Riva Road outside the city limits.  Its former buildings now house Bates Middle School and the Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts. AcademicsIn 2010, Annapolis High was ranked as the 16th best high school in the state of Maryland (3rd in Anne Arundel County; 297th overall) in Newsweek's America's Best High Schools list.   Annapolis is noted for its International Baccalaureate (I.B.) program  — one of three county schools with the program (the other two being Meade and Old Mill).  The I.B. program is a rigorous college-preparatory curriculum for grades 11 and 12 that emphasizes critical thinking and features a strong international focus.  The school also offers nearly every Advanced Placement (A.P.) class approved by the College Board as well as an English for Speakers of Other Languages program.Recently, the Annapolis High math team has won the Anne Arundel County High School Mathematics Competition four years straight (2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010). Annapolis High publishes a school newspaper (The Anchor), a yearbook (The Wake), a literary & arts magazine (Perception), and produces a newscast (Pantherama/P:tv). AthleticsAnnapolis High has a long and storied athletic history, including a football program dating back to 1896  that has won state titles  and has an all-time winning percentage of nearly 70%; a boys' basketball program — led by the all-time winningest coach in the history of Maryland public schools, John Brady  — that has won several state titles, has made more state "Final Four" appearances than any other high school in Maryland, and has won a state-record 26 regional titles;    and boys' and girls' lacrosse programs dating back to 1929  that have won numerous state championships.         Annapolis has also won state championships in wrestling (2008),  boys' indoor track (2002),  tennis (2000),  and girls' gymnastics (1989). Zero-basing controversy & academic turnaroundAfter the school's standardized test scores failed to meet federal Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) standards, Anne Arundel County Schools Superintendent Kevin M. Maxwell required the school's entire staff — including the principal, administrators, teachers, secretaries, and custodians — to reapply for their positions in the fall of 2007, a controversial move termed "zero-basing" that is one of several reform options authorized by the Maryland Department of Education and the federal No Child Left Behind law.  As a result, around half of the teachers and staff did not return in 2008.   The school also hired a group of "AYP Specialists" and other support staff to focus primarily on ensuring that the school's standardized test scores reached state and federal standards. Within 30 months of zero-basing, the school successfully made an academic turnaround and met AYP standards in two consecutive years    and increased the number of students who passed the Maryland School Assessment 34 percentage points in English and 19 points in math.

Maryland darter   The Maryland darter (Etheostoma sellare) is freshwater fish species that has been found only in Deer Creek, Maryland. It is now a thought to be extinct. It was long known only by two specimens until it was rediscovered in 1962. From 1965 to the 1980s, it was only confined to a single riffle in Deer Creek. The species may have fallen victim to habitat destruction.  It was last observed in 1988. While the IUCN has declared the species extinct, World Conservation Monitoring Centre. 1996.

Maryland Route 97      Maryland Route 97 (MD 97) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The route runs   from U.S. Route 29 in Silver Spring, Montgomery County north to the Pennsylvania border in Carroll County, where the road continues into that state as Pennsylvania Route 97. Throughout most of Montgomery County, MD 97 is known as  Georgia Avenue, which continues south from the southern terminus along US 29 into Washington, D.C. It is a suburban four- to six-lane divided highway from Silver Spring north to Olney. From here, the route continues as a rural two-lane road north through Brookeville and into Howard County. MD 97 continues through Carroll County where it passes through the county seat of Westminster. The route intersects many major roads, including Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway) north of Silver Spring, Maryland Route 200 (Intercounty Connector) in Aspen Hill, Maryland Route 28 in Norbeck, Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40 in Cooksville, Maryland Route 26 in Dorsey Crossroads, and Maryland Route 27, Maryland Route 32, and Maryland Route 140 in the Westminster area.With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, present-day MD 97 north of Westminster became a part of U.S. Route 140. The designation MD 97 was first used by 1940 for the road running from US 29 in Silver Spring to north of US 40 in Cooksville. An extension of the route by 1960 took it to the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg, Frederick County. It replaced Maryland Route 570, which ran from MD 26 to just north of the Carroll-Howard county line, paralled MD 32 between Westminster and Taneytown, and replaced MD 32 from Taneytown to the Pennsylvania border. By 1979, MD 97 was shifted onto its current alignment north of Westminster with the removal of US 140 from the U.S. Highway System; the MD 140 designation was applied to the former MD 97 that ran northwest from Westminster. Route descriptionMaryland Route 97 runs through the Washington, D.C. suburbs in Montgomery County, connecting several communities including Silver Spring, Wheaton, Glenmont, Norbeck, and Olney. It continues north from there into rural areas of Howard and Carroll counties, passing through the Carroll County seat of Westminster, before reaching the Pennsylvania border.    Montgomery CountyMaryland Route 97 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 29 and Maryland Route 384 (Colesville Road) in downtown Silver Spring in Montgomery County, heading north on Georgia Avenue, a six-lane divided highway with a   speed limit. Washington Metro's Red Line runs below the route at this point.   From the route’s southern terminus, Georgia Avenue continues south as part of US 29 toward Washington, D.C. MD 97 passes commercial areas of high-rise buildings in Silver Spring before heading into residential neighborhoods. The route intersects the northern terminus of Maryland Route 390 (16th Street), which heads south and becomes 16th Street Northwest upon entering the District of Columbia. It continues north as a six-lane undivided road with reversible lanes through commercial areas before coming to a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway).  Past this interchange, the road becomes a divided highway again and intersects Maryland Route 192 (Forest Glen Road). MD 97 passes more residences as a   road that continues toward Wheaton. The road heads into business areas again as it intersects Maryland Route 586 (Veirs Mill Road) near the Westfield Wheaton shopping mall.

The route heads into a mix of residential and commercial areas as it heads toward Glenmont, where it crosses Randolph Road.   A short distance later, MD 97 intersects the southern terminus of Maryland Route 182 (Layhill Road).  From here, MD 97 turns northwest through residential neighborhoods, where as a   road it passes the Glenmont station terminus of Washington Metro's Red Line, before reaching some businesses near the intersection with the northern terminus of Maryland Route 185 (Connecticut Avenue) in Aspen Hill. It turns north again past this intersection and crosses Bel Pre Road. After crossing Bel Pre Road, the route heads into wooded neighborhoods before it passes through a mix of businesses and houses, with Maryland Route 655 running to the west of the road. MD 97 crosses Maryland Route 28 (Norbeck Road) in Norbeck, and continues past some residences where it intersects Maryland Route 655A, a short connector that provides access to westbound MD 28.   MD 97 enters more wooded areas and narrows to four lanes, interchanging with Maryland Route 200 (Intercounty Connector).     The route eventually passes parkland and residential areas as it crosses Emory Lane.    The road approaches Olney and passes by residential neighborhoods before heading into a business district at the intersection with Maryland Route 108 (Olney Sandy Spring Road).  After this intersection, the road heads into wooded residential areas as a two-lane undivided road, with the speed limit dropping to   and then to   as the road enters Brookeville. Upon entering Brookeville, MD 97 becomes High Street and passes more residences. The route makes a left turn onto Market Street and continues through wooded residential areas. It heads out of Brookeville, with the name changing back to Georgia Avenue and the speed limit increasing to  .    The road heads into a more rural setting, with areas of farms, woods, and some residences.   MD 97 reaches Sunshine, where the speed limit decreases to   and the road crosses Maryland Route 650 (New Hampshire Avenue/Damascus Road).   Past Sunshine, MD 97 resumes through rural areas and enters woodland within Patuxent River State Park, with the speed limit increasing to   as it approaches the Patuxent River.   Howard CountyMD 97 crosses the Patuxent River into Howard County, where it becomes Roxbury Mills Road.  It continues north, passing areas of woods and farms along with suburban residential developments.   The road passes through the community of Glenwood, where the speed limit drops to  . Upon leaving Glenwood, the speed limit climbs back to   and MD 97 passes through agricultural areas before intersecting Maryland Route 144 (Frederick Road) in Cooksville.   A short distance later, the route interchanges with Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40. Past this interchange, MD 97 becomes Hoods Mill Road and passes rural residential areas, intersecting Old Frederick Road.   From here, the speed limit drops to   as the road winds through a mix of woods, farm fields, and residences before crossing the South Branch of the Patapsco River.   Carroll CountyUpon crossing the river, MD 97 enters Carroll County and becomes Old Washington Road.   The road crosses CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision railroad and the speed limit drops to   as it passes wooded areas with some residences before increasing to   again.   It runs through a mix of woods and farms with some residences along the road.  The number of residences increases as the route crosses Streaker Road in Berrett as a   road. From here, MD 97 passes more residences as a   road before intersecting Maryland Route 850 (Old Liberty Road) at a roundabout; a short distance later, it intersects Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) at a folded diamond interchange in Dorsey Crossroads.   Past MD 26, MD 97 becomes New Washington Road and heads north through a mix of farmland, woodland, and residential neighborhoods, paralleled to the west by Maryland Route 854 (Old Washington Road).  The road passes through woodland before intersecting Nicodemus Road, where it continues past farms and woods before crossing Maryland Route 32 (Sykesville Road) in Fenby.  Past this intersection, MD 97 passes to the east of Carroll Community College and heads into residential areas as it approaches Westminster, bypassing the center of the town to the east.   The route becomes Malcolm Drive past the intersection with Main Street/Old Westminster Road and continues to an intersection with Maryland Route 140 (Baltimore Boulevard). Here, MD 97 makes a left turn to form a concurrency with MD 140 on Baltimore Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway.   The two routes head through commercial areas on the outskirts of Westminster, passing by the TownMall of Westminster before interchanging with Maryland Route 27 (Manchester Road) at a folded-diamond interchange.  Past this interchange, the road passes over the Maryland Midland Railway and passes more businesses. At the Sullivan Road intersection, the road becomes College View Boulevard and a short distance later, MD 97 splits from MD 140 at an interchange near McDaniel College.  MD 97 continues north on Littlestown Pike, a two-lane undivided road. The road passes Carroll County Regional Airport before heading into a mix of farmland and residences, with the speed limit increasing to  . MD 97 intersects the southern terminus of Maryland Route 496 (Bachmans Valley Road), and continues northwest through agricultural and wooded areas with intermittent residences, with the speed limit eventually dropping to  . It passes through Union Mills, where the speed limit drops to   and the road intersects Old Hanover Road. The speed limit rises to   upon leaving Union Mills before dropping to   again as MD 97 enters Silver Run, a community of residences. Upon leaving this community, the speed limit on the route increases to   as it continues through woods and farm fields.   A short distance later, MD 97 reaches the Pennsylvania border, where it becomes Pennsylvania Route 97 and continues north into Adams County.  HistoryFollowing the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the portion of present-day MD 97 north of Westminster was designated as part of U.S. Route 140, a U.S. Highway that ran from Baltimore to Gettysburg .     The designation MD 97 was first used by 1940 for the road running from US 29 in Silver Spring to north of US 40 in Cooksville, while the present-day route from MD 26 to just north of the Howard-Carroll county line was designated as Maryland Route 570.  MD 97 was extended to the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg, Frederick County by 1960, running north from Cooksville to Westminster, replacing MD 570 in its entirety, and continuing northwest from Westminster through Taneytown and Emmitsburg, paralleling a portion of MD 32 to Taneytown and replacing the route past there.       Also by this time, MD 97 was widened into a divided highway between Silver Spring and Maryland Route 183 (Randolph Road) in Glenmont.  The divided highway portion of MD 97 was extended further north to MD 28 by 1975.  By 1979, U.S. Route 140 disappeared and MD 97 was moved to its current alignment north of Westminster, with the portion of the route that ran northwest from Westminster becoming a part of MD 140. MD 32 from Westminster to Taneytown became Maryland Route 832 by this time as well.    Dualization of MD 97 in Montgomery County was extended further north from MD 28 to MD 108 by the 1990s.    There are plans to build an interchange at the route’s intersection with Randolph Road in order to improve movements for automobiles as well as for pedestrians and bicycles accessing the nearby Glenmont Metro station.    Another new interchange was built with Maryland Route 200 (Intercounty Connector) north of MD 28 and opened on February 23, 2011.

List of BSA local councils and districts in Maryland 
Maryland's 3rd congressional district     Maryland's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district in the state of Maryland. It comprises portions of Baltimore, Howard and Anne Arundel counties, as well as a significant part of the independent city of Baltimore. The seat is currently represented by John Sarbanes, a Democrat. Landmarks in the district include Fort McHenry and the Maryland Science Center.The last three people to represent Maryland in the United States Senate were all former representatives of the 3rd district. Those include the two current Maryland senators, Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski, as well as retired senator Paul Sarbanes.The district's odd shape is attributed to gerrymandering in order to favor Democratic candidates following the 2000 Census.  In 2012 the district was found to be the third least compact congressional district in the United States.   However, the district was heavily Democratic even before then; a Republican hasn't held it since 1927.  Recent elections  United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006   Historical boundaries and compositionMaryland's 3rd district was one of the 50 or so districts that elected a representative to the 1st United States Congress. It also has the distinction of being one of the few congressional districts that once included areas not currently in the state they are in.  The 3rd congressional district originally was composed of Prince George's County, Maryland and Anne Arundel County, Maryland.   At that point what is now Howard County, Maryland was in Anne Arundel County, and Prince George's County included the eastern half of the District of Columbia. In 1792 the Maryland 3rd Congressional District was moved to include Montgomery County, Maryland and the eastern half of Frederick County, Maryland.  The population was about 33,000.   However, the western portion of what is today Carroll County, Maryland was at this point in Frederick County, and the western half of the District of Columbia was in Montgomery County.  This latter fact explains why the district lost population even though it in theory did not experience redistricting after the 1800 census.  With the population of Georgetown, D. C. no longer in the district, its 1800 population was about 31,000.   At this point the 3rd was Maryland's least populous district, barely having half the population of the Baltimore City and County 5th district, which in 1800 had just above 59,000 inhabitants. The boundaries remained the same after the 1810, 1820 and 1830 censuses.  While in 1820 the district had about 36,000 inhabitants its population had risen to 53,622 in 1830.   With the formation of Carroll County in the 1830s as well as Maryland falling from 8 to 6 congressional seats, the boundaries of the 3rd Congressional District were drastically redrawn.  The only area that remained in the 3rd Congressional District was the part of Carroll County that had been in Frederick County.  The 3rd also included Baltimore County and the western half of the city of Baltimore.  Its new population was 69,923, 24.5% of whom were black. In 1853 the 3rd district was redrawn again.  The new district consisted of Baltimore County except for the northern and western parts of the county and about the eastern third of the City of Baltimore.  The district now had a population of 95,729.   In the redistricting following the 1860 census, Maryland was reduced to five congressional districts.  The 3rd was moved so that it contained the part of Baltimore that had not been in the 3rd before 1863.  It now a population of 130,040.   In 1873 the 3rd district was moved again, to be the east side of Baltimore.  It now had a population of 120,978.

Maryland and Delaware Railroad    The Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company   is a Class III short-line railroad, formed in 1977 to operate several branch lines of the former Penn Central Railroad in both Maryland and Delaware. These branches were omitted from the system plan for Conrail in 1976 and would have been discontinued without state subsidies. As an alternative to the higher cost of subsidizing Conrail as operator of the branch lines, the Maryland and Delaware governments selected Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company (MDDE) to serve as the designated operator.  The railroad did not actually own any of the track it uses until 2000 when it acquired a line, between Frankford, Delaware and Snow Hill, Maryland, from the Snow Hill Shippers Association.  Today, the railroad operates on more than 120 miles of track and runs out of a restored station in Federalsburg, Maryland.  HistoryMDDE incorporated in the State of Maryland on June 20, 1977 as a closely held, small railroad company.  At that time, the states of Maryland and Delaware were paying subsidies to Conrail for branch lines, still owned by Penn Central, serving rural communities. "History". Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company (February 2, 2010). Retrieved 2010-06-04 The Maryland Department of Transportation selected MDDE to operate three of the rural branch lines in August 1977. These included the current Northern and Seaford Lines, and the discontinued branch between Clayton, Delaware and Easton, Maryland. Maryland purchased the two branches served by the MDDE Northern and Seaford Lines. Snow Hill Shippers Association purchased the branch currently known as the Snow Hill Line in 1982 and hired MDDE to serve as operator.  MDDE became owner of the branch in 2000. MDDE was awarded a five-year contract by Delaware in 1994 to operate a branch between Ellendale, Delaware and Milton, Delaware, and another branch between Georgetown, Delaware and Lewes, Delaware. These branches were part of the former Queen Anne's Railroad, which began providing rail service between Queenstown, Maryland and Lewes, Delaware in 1894, and extended its track to Love Point, Maryland in 1902. MDDE did not seek renewal of the Delaware contract and operation of the two lines was returned to the previous contractor, Delaware Coast Line Railroad, in 1999.  The current 5-year operating contract with the Maryland Department of Transportation for the North Line and Seaford Line became effective in 2008. Two 5-year renewal options allow the contract to be extended until 2023.  Lines operated The Maryland and Delaware Railroad operates on three distinct segments of track throughout the Delmarva Peninsula. Each segment intersects the Norfolk Southern Railway.   The Northern Line intersects Norfolk Southern in Townsend, Delaware and heads west towards Massey, Maryland, where the line splits into two branches, one destined for Chestertown, Maryland and the other destined for Centreville, Maryland. The Seaford Line intersects Norfolk Southern in Seaford, Delaware and continues west towards Cambridge, Maryland, passing through Federalsburg, Maryland and Hurlock, Maryland. The Snow Hill Line intersects Norfolk Southern in Frankford, Delaware and continues south towards Snow Hill, Maryland.

Chicken Maryland  The term "Chicken Maryland" or "Maryland Chicken" is a historic dish associated with the U.S. state of Maryland, but has other meanings from other nations. In its home base, the food dish consists of fried chicken served with a cream gravy.  History and preparation Many Maryland families have their own heirloom recipes for this dish, and it remains a regional specialty in Eastern Shore restaurants.The primary factor which distinguishes Maryland fried chicken from other Southern fried chicken is that rather than cooking the chicken in several inches of oil or shortening, the chicken is pan-fried in a heavy (traditionally cast-iron) skillet and covered tightly after the initial browning so that the chicken steams as well as fries.  Milk or cream is then added to the pan juices to create a white cream gravy, another Maryland characteristic. Escoffier had a recipe for "Chicken à la Maryland" in his landmark cookbook Ma Cuisine, but there is no canonical version of the recipe. Often the chicken is marinated in a buttermilk marinade. Breading recipes vary in use of egg or buttermilk and the seasoning of the flour; the seasoning of the cream gravy also varies widely, although gravy is a signature aspect of the dish.  Australia In Australia the term 'Chicken Maryland' simply refers to a butcher's cut consisting of the entire leg of thigh and drumstick, rather than any specific dish.  UK The dish known in the UK as Chicken Maryland, popular in the 1960s, consisted of fried chicken (often in breadcrumbs) served with sweetcorn fritters and fried bananas. It is likely that it was derived as an alternative for the American version of the dish.In England, there is a small chain of stores known as Maryland Chicken, mostly found in Leicestershire. There is no connection between the store name and the traditional dish, however. Their menu consists of normal fried-chicken cuisine, similar to KFC.  Elsewhere Other reported versions include: a fried chicken leg with ham and hush puppies (a batter made with flour, egg, oil, and milk or water, to which corn is added, then deep-fried); batter-fried chicken with hush-puppies and batter-fried bananas and pineapple rings; and bread-crumbed and fried chicken wings & drumsticks with sautéed bananas. Apparently some Southeast-Asian variations exist, such as one with breaded chicken thighs, hush puppies, and gravy, served with deep-fried potato slices, baby carrots, fried tomato halves, and fried bananas. In Argentina, Suprema de Pollo Maryland is a pounded thin breast of chicken, breaded and fried, served with creamed corn, peas, bacon (panceta), French fries and a fried banana. The final first-class lunch menu on RMS Titanic included a dish called "Chicken à la Maryland".  References  External links  Recipes at ChickenMaryland.com

Woodside Park (Silver Spring, Maryland)   Woodside Park is a neighborhood located in Silver Spring, Maryland, in the United States. Early historyWoodside Park began as the Alton Farm, country estate of Crosby Noyes, a prominent Washingtonian and owner of the Washington Evening Star newspaper. Upon his death in 1908, his will gave the land to his children with a provision that his widow could live on the estate until her death. She survived until 1914.  The Noyes children eventually sold the property to the Woodside Development Corporation in 1922.  The corporation divided the farm into lots of approximately one acre each, though most original lots were later subdivided into half acre or smaller parcels.  LocationWoodside Park is located just north of downtown of Silver Spring, one of the oldest suburbs of Washington, DC. Its boundaries are Georgia Avenue (State Route 97) on the west, Spring Street to the South, Colesville Road (US Route 29) to the east, and Dale Drive and Columbia Boulevard on the north. It also includes one block of Clement Road north of Dale Drive and Clement Place.  It borders the neighborhoods of Woodside, Woodside Forest, North Woodside, and Seven Oaks-Evanswood. It also shares a boundary with the Silver Spring business district. The ParkWoodside Park is characterized by its park-like setting, including roads that followed the contours of the land, and not a grid, as well as a number of streams. Most of these streams, however, have been moved underground into pipes. The styles of homes in the neighborhood vary, with examples of most of the styles of residential architecture popular through the 20th century.The neighborhood maintains the Woodside Park Civic Association (WPCA), which publishes a monthly newsletter, called The Vo!ce from September through June. It also sponsors an "Oktoberfest" and Halloween with pumpkin carving and costumes in October, as well as an annual picnic in June. References    Woodside Park History Page Woodside Synagogue

Maryland Route 17    Maryland Route 17 (MD 17) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway begins at the Virginia state line at the Potomac River in Brunswick, where the highway continues south as Virginia State Route 287 (SR 287).  MD 17 runs   north from the Brunswick Bridge to the Frederick–Washington county line near Wolfsville.  The state highway serves as the main north–south highway of the Middletown Valley of western Frederick County.  MD 17 connects Brunswick and Wolfsville with Rosemont, Burkittsville, Middletown, and Myersville.  The state highway also connects those communities with the valley's main east–west highways, which include U.S. Route 340, US 40 Alternate, Interstate 70 (I-70), and US 40.What is now MD 17 was originally designated MD 33.  The first sections of the state highway were constructed in Brunswick and Rosemont in 1916.  MD 33 was mostly constructed south of Myersville in the early 1920s; the last pieces of the Brunswick–Myersville highway were filled in by 1927.  MD 33 was completed from Myersville to Wolfsville in the early 1930s.  MD 33 swapped numbers with the original MD 17, a highway on the Eastern Shore, in 1940.  The portion of MD 17 north of Wolfsville was brought into the state highway system in 1956, the same year the Myersville–Middletown Road was transferred to county control.  The state highway north of Myersville was designated MD 153.  In the mid 1980s, MD 17 was extended north from Middletown, assuming all of MD 153 to its present northern terminus.  The modern Brunswick Bridge was constructed in the early 1950s, replacing a bridge constructed in the early 1890s at the same site. Route descriptionMD 17 begins at the Virginia state line at the Potomac River in the city of Brunswick.  The roadway continues into Loudoun County, Virginia as SR 287 (Berlin Pike), which heads south toward Lovettsville.  MD 17 crosses the river on the Brunswick Bridge, a two-lane steel girder bridge that also passes over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision, Walnut Street, Virginia Avenue, and Potomac Street.  The bridge's northern end lands just south of a roundabout that connects MD 17 with Petersville Road, Maryland Avenue, and both directions of B Street.  Petersville Road, the old alignment of MD 17, heads south into the Brunswick Historic District and becomes Maple Avenue, which provides access to Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park and the historic Brunswick train station, which is served by MARC's Brunswick Line.  MD 17 heads north from the Brunswick Roundabout as two-lane Petersville Road, which climbs out of the narrow Potomac River valley.  At the top of the hill, the state highway leaves the city of Brunswick and enters the village of Rosemont, where the highway intersects MD 79 and MD 464 (Souder Road).  Petersville Road continues north as MD 79 while MD 17 turns northwest onto Burkittsville Road.  The state highway leaves the village of Rosemont and intersects the western end of Rosemont Drive, the old alignment of MD 17 that is unsigned MD 871G.  MD 17 intersects MD 180 (Jefferson Pike) at a roundabout before meeting US 340 (Jefferson National Pike) at a diamond interchange.  North of US 340, the state highway runs mostly straight through farmland parallel to the upper reaches of Little Catoctin Creek and South Mountain to the hamlet of Coatsville, where the highway passes through a pair of right-angle curves.   MD 17 curves to the northeast and enters the town of Burkittsville, where the highway's name becomes Potomac Street.  Within the Burkittsville Historic District, the state highway intersects Main Street, which heads west to Crampton's Gap, a low point in South Mountain that contains Gathland State Park.  MD 17 leaves Burkittsville and crosses Broad Run in the hamlet of Arnoldtown, then meets the northern end of MD 383 (Broad Run Road) and the west end of Bennies Hill Road, which leads to the Bennies Hill Road Bridge and historic Shafer's Mill.  The state highway continues across Middle Creek and parallels Catoctin Creek before crossing the latter stream on a through truss bridge.  MD 17 enters the town of Middletown just south of its intersection with Jefferson Street and Old Middletown Road.  The state highway passes through town as Church Street and meets US 40 Business (Main Street) in the center of the Middletown Historic District.  MD 17 leaves Middletown as Myersville Middletown Road, which heads northeast then curves northwest to parallel I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway).  The two highways cross Little Catoctin Creek—this creek being a tributary of Catoctin Creek rather than the Potomac River-feeding creek near Brunswick—near the state highway's intersection with Harmony Road, then MD 17 veers west away from the Interstate.  The state highway intersects Old Hagerstown Road at an oblique angle and crosses Catoctin Creek again before veering north and temporarily expanding to a four-lane divided highway for its diamond interchange with I-70 at the town limit of Myersville.  After reducing to two lanes, MD 17 continues as Main Street toward the center of town, where the state highway turns east onto Wolfsville Road.  The state highway crosses Catoctin Creek just north of its confluence with Middle Creek and intersects US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) at the Myersville town limits.  MD 17 heads north into a mountainous area with a mix of farmland and forest at the northern end of the Middletown Valley.  The state highway parallels Middle Creek, which it crosses twice, the second time at the hamlet of Ellerton, where the highway intersects Harmony Road, crosses the creek, then immediately turns east to remain on Wolfsville Road at its intersection with Harp Hill Road.  Harp Hill Road is a straighter but much steeper alternate route between Ellerton and Wolfsville compared to MD 17, which parallels Middle Creek and crosses the creek thrice as it winds through the communities of Crossnickel and Middlepoint and passes the historic Peter of P. Grossnickel Farm.  The state highway meets the northern end of Harp Mill Road and intersects Pleasant Walk Road and Stottlemeyer Road in Wolfsville.  MD 17 leaves Middle Creek and ascends South Mountain to its northern terminus at its intersection with Garfield Road and Loy Wolfe Road at the Frederick–Washington county line.  Wolfsville Road continues north as a county highway that descends South Mountain to MD 77 (Foxville Road) in Smithsburg on the eastern edge of the Hagerstown Valley.   HistoryThe first two sections of MD 17 to be constructed were Petersville Road from downtown Brunswick to what is now Rosemont Drive in Rosemont and Burkittsville Road from what is now MD 180 to Coatsville, which were completed as   wide macadam roads in 1916.   By 1921, sections of concrete road were completed from the National Pike in Middletown to Valley View Road and from Myersville south to Catoctin Creek.  Another section of the highway was planned to followed the alignment of Old Hagerstown Road south from the Myersville segment to the National Pike west of Middletown.   By 1923, the gap between Middletown and Myersville was completed in concrete following the present alignment instead of Old Hagerstown Road.  Other segments completed that year included a macadam stretch from Coatsville to Burkittsville and a concrete road from Arnoldtown to the National Pike in Middletown. In 1927, what is now MD 17 became one of the original state-numbered highways when it was marked as MD 33.  By that year, the gap between Burkittsville and Arnoldtown, Main Street in Myersville, and Wolfsville Road from Ellerton to Grossnickel had been paved with concrete.  In addition, a macadam road was constructed from Main Street in Myersville to the first crossing of Middle Creek north of the town.   The gap between that crossing of Middle Creek and Ellerton was filled by a concrete road in 1928.   Wolfsville Road from Grossnickel to Middlepoint was started in 1930.   That segment and the portion from Middlepoint to Wolfsville were completed in 1933.    MD 33's through truss bridge over Catoctin Creek between Burkittsville and Middletown was replaced with the modern through truss bridge on a new alignment in 1934.    All of MD 33 between Brunswick and Wolfsville was redesignated MD 17 in 1940, swapping numbers with modern MD 33 in Talbot County. The portion of Wolfsville Road from Wolfsville north to the Washington County line was brought into the state highway system in 1956.  That same year, the portion of MD 17 between US 40 Alternate in Middletown and US 40 in Myersville was transferred to county maintenance.  MD 17 north of Myersville was renumbered MD 153.   MD 17 was placed on its present alignment in Rosemont from MD 79 to Rosemont Drive in 1968; MD 79 was extended south to the new four-way intersection with MD 17 and MD 464 and the old alignment of MD 17 along Rosemont Drive became MD 871G.   MD 153 was extended south of US 40 through Myersville to the I-70 interchange in 1979.   MD 17 achieved its present course in 1985 when the highway between Middletown and I-70 was returned to the state highway system; MD 17 was extended along what had been MD 153 to the Washington County line.   MD 17's roundabouts at the northern end of the Brunswick Bridge and at the MD 180 intersection were installed in 1999 and 2000, respectively.  The first ferry at the German Crossing of the Potomac River, named for the German settlement at Lovettsville, began at the site of Brunswick in 1731.   The first fixed crossing of the river was a covered bridge constructed between 1854 and 1857 by the Loudoun and Berlin Bridge Company; this bridge was burned by Confederate forces in June 1861.  In 1893, the Loudoun Berlin Bridge Company constructed an iron through truss bridge across the river on the abutments of the covered bridge.    Both the covered bridge and the iron bridge were located in line with Virginia Avenue, immediately to the east of the modern bridge.   Later, the access road to the bridge would follow Maple Avenue south from Petersville Road, cross the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, turn west onto what is now the access road for the C&O Canal Historical Park, then turn south to cross the river.   Construction on the modern Brunswick Bridge began in 1952 with preliminary engineering work and construction of the bridge's substructure and superstructure, which were completed in 1953.    Work on the bridge's deck and the Maryland approaches began in 1953 and continued through 1954.   The Brunswick Bridge was dedicated July 30, 1955.  Junction list                            Auxiliary routeMD 17A is the designation for Petersville Road, a   section of old alignment of MD 17 immediately northeast of the Brunswick Roundabout.

Maryland Route 193  Maryland Route 193 (MD 193) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as University Boulevard and Greenbelt Road, the state highway runs   from MD 185 in Kensington east to MD 202 north of Upper Marlboro.  MD 193 serves as a major east-west commuter route in eastern Montgomery County and northern Prince George's County, connecting Wheaton, Silver Spring, Langley Park, College Park, and Greenbelt.  The state highway also provides the primary access to the University of Maryland and Goddard Space Flight Center.  In central Prince George's County, MD 193 is the main north-south highway connecting Glenn Dale and Greater Upper Marlboro with the affluent suburbs of Woodmore and Kettering.MD 193 originally consisted of Connecticut Avenue between Chevy Chase and Kensington and University Lane between Kensington and College Park.  While MD 185 replaced MD 193 on the Connecticut Avenue portion in the 1970s, MD 193 grew on its eastern end by taking over the routing of MD 430 between College Park and Greenbelt and MD 199 in Glenn Dale in the early 1960s.  MD 193 reached its final extent by taking over MD 556 between Glenn Dale and Greater Upper Marlboro in the late 1980s.  The state highway's expansion from a two-lane road to a divided highway with four to six lanes began in the 1950s and continued through the 1990s. Route description Montgomery CountyMD 193 begins at an acute intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue) in Kensington.  There is no access between southbound MD 185 and eastbound MD 193, as well as between westbound MD 193 and northbound MD 185; those movements use Perry Avenue.  The state highway, named University Boulevard, heads northeast as a six-lane divided highway with a speed limit of   through a commercial area.  After leaving the town limits of Kensington, the speed limit increases to   and MD 193 passes through a mix of apartment complexes and single family homes  The state highway enters the commercial district of Wheaton, where the road passes the Wheaton Plaza shopping mall and intersects MD 586 (Veirs Mill Road).  MD 586 south is used to access the Wheaton station of the Washington Metro.  MD 193 continues east through the commercial area to meet MD 97 (Georgia Avenue).  There are no left turns allowed from MD 193 to MD 97; instead, the eastbound and westbound directions use Grandview Avenue and Amherst Avenue, respectively, to complete the missing movements.  After passing the WTOP-FM radio transmitter, MD 193 heads southeast through suburban residential areas.  The state highway descends into the valley of Sligo Creek, where the highway meets the northern end of Sligo Creek Parkway and crosses the Sligo Creek Trail.  MD 193 passes a cluster of high-rise apartment buildings and Northwood High School around the intersection with Arcola Avenue and turns south, passing Dennis Avenue.  MD 193 splits into a one-way pair upon entering the Four Corners commercial area, where the highway intersects U.S. Route 29 (US 29) and passes Montgomery Blair High School.  The state highway then meets the Capital Beltway at a partial cloverleaf interchange that is missing the movements between I-495 west and MD 193 west.  The missing movements are completed by using US 29 south of Four Corners.  After crossing the Capital Beltway, MD 193 continues south through residential suburban areas of Silver Spring, intersecting Franklin Avenue.  After meeting MD 320 and passing Quebec Terrace Park, the state highway turns southeast and enters an area of garden apartments and duplexes.  After crossing MD 195 at an oblique angle, the speed limit falls to   and MD 193 enters Prince George's County. Prince George's CountyMD 193 continues east into Langley Park, an area with multiple shopping centers, garden apartments, and heavy pedestrian cross-traffic.  MD 193 meets MD 650 at Takoma-Langley Crossroads, an intersection with a shopping center on all four corners.  The state highway continues straight southeast toward its junction with MD 212, where MD 193 turns east.  After passing Lane Manor Recreation Center, the state highway leaves the commercial area and crosses Northwest Branch.  Here the highway reduces to four lanes and the speed limit increases to  .  MD 193 continues east through a forested area toward College Park.  Campus Drive continues straight toward the University of Maryland campus as well as University of Maryland University College, while MD 193 veers left and intersects Adelphi Road.  Movements between MD 193 east and Adelphi Road south are made via Campus Drive.  After passing Adelphi Road, the state highway heads northeast past the intersection with Stadium Drive, which is used to access Byrd Stadium and the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center.  After turning east again, MD 193 intersects Paint Branch Drive, which serves the Comcast Center.  The state highway passes Paint Branch Golf Course and crosses Paint Branch, after which the speed limit drops to   and the highway intersects US 1 at a partial interchange.  The missing movements are made via a right-in/right-out interchange on the eastbound side just to the east of the partial interchange, and through Greenbelt Road (unsigned MD 430) just to the east of Rhode Island Avenue, which has a westbound at-grade exit and eastbound entrance.  After passing Greenbelt Road, MD 193 expands to six lanes and its name changes to Greenbelt Road. The state highway crosses CSX's Capital Subdivision, MARC's Camden Line, and the Green Line (Washington Metro) of the Washington Metro and Indian Creek, then enters a commercial area as the highway straddles the northern boundary of Berwyn Heights.  After passing Cherrywood Drive, which leads to the Greenbelt (Washington Metro) Metro station, MD 193 passes Beltway Plaza shopping mall.  The state highway then meets MD 201 (Kenilworth Avenue) at a diamond interchange.  MD 193 continues east into Greenbelt as an eight-lane divided highway with a speed limit of   past Greenbelt Park until right before passing under the Capital Beltway, where the right lane eastbound exits for the southbound Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  Both directions of MD 193 access the southbound parkway via Southway, which heads north into the Greenbelt Historic District.  After crossing the parkway, MD 193 has an intersection with the northbound ramps to the parkway, after which the speed limit drops to  .  After passing Eleanor Roosevelt High School, the speed limit returns to  , the road reduces to four lanes, and the state highway passes a series of apartment complexes on the south and the campus of Goddard Space Flight Center on the north.  Beyond Goddard, MD 193 passes Good Luck Road and some more apartments and shopping centers in Glenn Dale before meeting MD 564 (Lanham Severn Road).  MD 193 heads southeast from MD 564 as Glenn Dale Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway with a wide median through scattered residential subdivisions.  The state highway immediately crosses the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line as well as Folly Branch.  MD 193 passes Marietta, a historic home and museum, before its intersection with MD 450 (Annapolis Road), where the name of the highway changes to Enterprise Road.  Beyond MD 450, the state highway slims down to two lanes and passes through residential subdivisions.  After an intersection with the old alignment, MD 953 (Glenn Dale Road), MD 193 temporarily becomes a divided highway as it passes under the US 50 freeway.  The state highway enters the affluent suburb of Woodmore, where it passes the Country Club at Woodmore and Enterprise Golf Course, which features the Newton White Mansion, before intersecting Lottsford Road and Woodmore Road.  MD 193 continues south and temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway with a speed limit of   prior to crossing the Northeast Branch of the Western Branch of the Patuxent River and meeting MD 214 (Central Avenue) in Kettering.  Beyond MD 214, the state highway becomes a two-lane road with a speed limit of   and changes its name to Watkins Park Drive.  MD 193 passes Watkins Regional Park and First Baptist Church of Glenarden before encountering Oak Grove Drive at a roundabout.  From there, the state highway turns southwest and meets its eastern terminus at MD 202 (Largo Road) at the boundary between the census-designated places of Kettering and Brock Hall.   HistoryMD 193 originally consisted of two named portions, Connecticut Avenue from Chevy Chase to Kensington and University Lane from Kensington to College Park.     The Connecticut Avenue segment is now MD 185; that portion's history is covered in more detail in the Maryland Route 185 article.  University Lane was paved from Kensington to Wheaton and from Four Corners to MD 320 in Silver Spring by 1927.     The pavement extended from MD 320 to MD 212 in 1930; the segment of road on the University of Maryland campus was also paved.     By 1933, MD 193 was fully paved from Kensington to US 1 in College Park when the portion between MD 212 and the university was completed on a new alignment.   The roads over which MD 193 would later be extended east consisted of three state highways:  MD 430 (Greenbelt Road) was completed on a new alignment in 1942 between US 1 in College Park and MD 205 (now MD 201) in Greenbelt.   Greenbelt Road continued east as a county-maintained highway towards Glenn Dale.    MD 199 (Glenn Dale Road) was paved from US 50 (now MD 450) north to the Penn Line in 1927.   The MD 199 designation was extended north to MD 564 in 1950, then removed from the entire road in 1954.       MD 556 (Enterprise Road) was paved from MD 214 north to near Woodmore Road in 1933.   A second segment of MD 556 was signed from US 50 south to the present intersection of MD 193 and MD 953 by 1939.   The two segments were connected by a county-maintained segment that was brought under state control by 1946.   MD 556 was extended south along Enterprise Road to MD 202 in 1955.     The four-lane divided bypass of the University of Maryland was started by 1955 and completed in 1956.        At that time, MD 193 turned south at the right-in/right-out ramps just east of the US 1 overpass to a right angle intersection with MD 430.   The four-lane divided highway was extended west from College Park in stages, reaching MD 650 in 1957, Franklin Avenue (then MD 516) in 1959, US 29 in Four Corners in 1960, and Kensington in the early 1960s.               MD 193's western terminus was moved from Chevy Chase to Kensington in the 1970s.     MD 193 was expanded to six lanes between Kensington and Langley Park beginning in 1972. Between 1962 and 1964, MD 193 was extended east as a four-lane divided highway from College Park along MD 430 and the remainder of Greenbelt Road to Glenn Dale.    The state highway then headed south along Glenn Dale Road (former MD 199) to MD 450, then south along the part of Glenn Dale Road that had never been state-maintained to an intersection with MD 556 just north of the US 50 freeway.  MD 193 was expanded to six lanes between MD 430 and just east of MD 201 in 1988, when the MD 201 interchange was completed.   The six lane section was extended to the east edge of Greenbelt in 1994. Glenn Dale Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway, was finished in 1986 when its bridge over the Penn Line was completed, replacing a grade crossing at Glenn Dale Road.      Glenn Dale Boulevard extended south to the intersection of MD 450 and MD 556.  MD 193 was extended south on Glenn Dale Boulevard then replaced MD 556 on Enterprise Road south to MD 214.   Finally, Watkins Park Drive was built in 1988 on a new alignment, replacing Enterprise Road south of MD 214.   MD 193 was extended along Watkins Park Drive and replaced the remaining segment of MD 556.

Maryland Route 104    Maryland Route 104 (MD 104) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as Waterloo Road, the state highway runs   from MD 108 in Columbia north to MD 103 in Ellicott City.  MD 104 connects MD 108, MD 103, and MD 100 in northeastern Howard County.  The state highway was originally constructed as MD 531 in the early 1930s and became part of MD 175 in the mid-1940s.  After MD 175 was rerouted through Columbia in the late 1970s, MD 104 was assigned to its present course. Route descriptionMD 104 begins at a three-way intersection with MD 108 in the hamlet of Jonestown on the northern edge of the Columbia village of Long Reach.  MD 108 heads southeast as a continuation of Waterloo Road toward Jessup and west as Old Annapolis Road, which provides access to Howard High School and ramps to and from eastbound MD 100.  MD 104 heads north as a four-lane undivided highway across MD 100 to a roundabout where the state highway intersects ramps to and from westbound MD 100.  MD 104 reduces to two lanes and passes through a suburban area on the southern edge of Ellicott City, where the highway reaches its northern terminus at MD 103 (Montgomery Road), which heads southeast toward Elkridge and northwest toward downtown Ellicott City.   HistoryWaterloo Road was built as a macadam road in 1932 from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Jessup north to MD 103 in Ellicott City; the highway was designated MD 531.     MD 531 was replaced with a northern extension of MD 175 from Jessup to Ellicott City by 1946.   Old Annapolis Road was designated MD 539 in 1956; that highway became part of an extended MD 108 in 1960 when US 29 was moved to Columbia Pike from Silver Spring to Ellicott City.  After MD 175 was rerouted along Little Patuxent Parkway (now named Rouse Parkway) from west of Interstate 95 to Columbia Town Center around 1977, MD 108 was extended east to its present terminus near I-95.   The portion of Waterloo Road between MD 108 and MD 103 was designated MD 104 by 1979.   When MD 100 was under construction between MD 104 and I-95 in the late 1990s, a standard intersection with MD 104 served as the eastern terminus of the two-lane, disjoint section of MD 100 between US 29 and MD 104.   MD 104's interchange with MD 100 was completed in 1998 concurrent with the portion of the freeway from MD 104 to I-95.   Junction list          Auxiliary routeMD 104A is the designation for the   section of Oak Run Way between MD 104 and the residential subdivision the street serves immediately north of MD 104's interchange with MD 100.

Maryland Route 103  Maryland Route 103 (MD 103) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs   from St. Johns Lane in Ellicott City east to Parkway Drive South in Hanover. MD 103 serves as the local complement to MD 100 from Ellicott City in northeastern Howard County through Dorsey to Hanover in northwestern Anne Arundel County. The state highway was constructed from U.S. Route 1 in Elkridge to US 29 in Ellicott City in the 1920s.  MD 103's eastern terminus was relocated from Elkridge to US 1 near Dorsey in 1956.  When MD 100 was constructed between Glen Burnie and Ellicott City in the 1990s, the state highway was extended to its present western and eastern termini. MD 103 replaced MD 176 from US 1 east to near MD 295. Route descriptionMD 103 begins at a point on St. Johns Lane just west of its intersection with High Point Road in Ellicott City. St. Johns Lane. St. Johns Lane continues west to Columbia Road, where the county highway turns north toward US 40. MD 103 heads east as Montgomery Road, a four-lane undivided highway, through a three-quarter diamond interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). Access to MD 103 from northbound US 29 is via MD 100 and Long Gate Parkway, which the state highway intersects east of Old Columbia Pike, which heads northeast into the Ellicott City Historic District. East of Long Gate Parkway, MD 103 reduces to two lanes and has a sporadic center left turn lane. Before leaving Ellicott City, the highway intersects MD 104 (Waterloo Road) and Ilchester Road, which heads east to the hamlet of Ilchester on the Patapsco River, where the county highway provides access to Patapsco Valley State Park and the ruins of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's Patterson Viaduct. On the western edge of Elkridge at Miller's Corner, MD 103 intersects the county-maintained portion of Montgomery Road, which heads east to the center of Elkridge.  MD 103 continues southeast along Meadowridge Road, which meets MD 100 at a dumbbell interchange. The highway passes under Interstate 95 (I-95) with no access and passes between Meadow Ridge Memorial Park on the north and an industrial park to the south before its intersection with US 1 (Washington Boulevard). MD 103 continues east as Dorsey Road, which curves northeast and then southeast again and intersects Douglas Legum Drive, which leads to the Dorsey station on MARC's Camden Line. The state highway is part of the National Highway System from US 1 east to Douglas Legum Drive as an intermodal connector to the Dorsey MARC station.  MD 103 crosses Deep Run and passes through the community of Dorsey, where the highway enters Anne Arundel County by passing under CSX's Capital Subdivision, which carries the MARC Camden Line. The highway crosses a branch of Deep Run and begins to parallel the eastbound side of MD 100. MD 103's name changes to Parkway Drive South at its intersection with Coca Cola Drive, which is unsigned MD 100M and has an interchange with MD 100 immediately to the north. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at an arbitrary point east of Race Road in a business park adjacent to MD 100's interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway) in Hanover.   HistoryMD 103 originally followed all of Montgomery Road from US 1 in Elkridge, which followed Old Washington Road, to US 29 (Old Columbia Pike) in Ellicott City.   The first section of MD 103 was paved in concrete from US 1 to west of Landing Road by 1923.   The next section was constructed as a concrete road from there west to the highway's intersection with Meadowridge Road at Miller's Corner in 1924 and 1925.    A disjoint section of MD 103 was built from US 29 east to near New Cut Road in 1928.   Montgomery Road was completed from near New Cut Road east to Miller's Corner by 1930. The portion of MD 103 east of US 1 was originally part of MD 176, which was completed as a concrete road from Glen Burnie west to the B&O Railroad in Dorsey on the Howard–Anne Arundel county line by 1930.   The portion between the county line and US 1 was constructed around 1936;  MD 176 originally met US 1 at an intersection just south of the modern US 1–MD 100 interchange.   The Howard County portion of MD 176 was widened in 1949.  MD 103 was widened from US 1 to Waterloo Road, which was then part of MD 175, in 1950.   The state highway was widened from Waterloo Road to US 29 starting in 1953.   In 1956, MD 103 was removed from Montgomery Road from Miller's Corner to Elkridge and instead placed on Meadowridge Road from Miller's Corner to US 1 near Dorsey. Several changes occurred in the route of MD 103 due to the construction of MD 100 in the 1990s.  MD 103 was extended to its present western terminus when its interchange with US 29 was built in 1992.    The western end of MD 176 was relocated to the double-curve alignment in Dorsey to tie into the eastern end of MD 103 by 1995.  MD 176 was cut in two when MD 100 took over the former highway's interchange with the Baltimore–Washington Parkway.   By 1997, MD 103 replaced MD 176 on Dorsey Road west of the parkway.  That same year, the intersection of Montgomery Road and Meadowridge Road was reconstructed to make MD 103 the through route instead of Montgomery Road.   MD 103's interchange with MD 100 was completed in 1998 when MD 100 opened from MD 104 to I-95.   Junction list                      Auxiliary routes  MD 103A is the designation for the   segment of Montgomery Road between US 1 and Old Washington Road in Elkridge.   MD 103C is the designation for the unnamed   service road that serves a shopping center at MD 103's intersection with MD 104 near Ellicott City.

Maryland Route 176  Maryland Route 176 (MD 176) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Dorsey Road, the highway runs   from the end of state maintenance in Hanover east to MD 648 in Glen Burnie. MD 176 is a mostly four-lane highway that parallels MD 100 and forms the southern portion of the Airport Loop, a circumferential highway around Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport) that connects the airport with various airport-related services. The highway provides the main connection between the airport and Interstate 97 (I-97); as such, the highway is part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector between I-97 and MD 162. MD 176 was constructed in the late 1920s between Glen Burnie and Dorsey at the Anne Arundel–Howard county line. The state highway was extended west to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) near Elkridge in the late 1930s concurrent with the construction of railroad grade separations at Dorsey and Harmans. MD 176 was widened over much of its length in the late 1940s and in Anne Arundel County in the 1970s and 1980s. MD 100 became the primary highway connecting Elkridge and Glen Burnie in the mid-1990s; MD 176 was subsequently truncated at Hanover. The portion of MD 176 west of MD 295 became an eastern extension of MD 103. Route descriptionMD 176 begins at the west end of state maintenance adjacent to the cloverleaf interchange between MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway) with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway) in Hanover. Dorsey Road continues north as a county highway through an industrial park. MD 176 heads east as a two-lane road that crosses Piney Run. The highway meets the northern edge of MD 713 (Arundel Mills Boulevard) just north of the highway's interchange with MD 100 northeast of Arundel Mills. MD 176 continues east as a four-lane undivided highway between a residential area to the south and industrial parks to the north. The highway parallels its old alignment, part of which is MD 645, through the hamlet of Harmans. There, the highway crosses over Stoney Run and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, which also carries MARC's Penn Line. Just east of the railroad crossing, MD 176 intersects MD 170, which heads south as Telegraph Road and north as Aviation Boulevard.  MD 176 continues east along the southern portion of the Airport Loop surrounding BWI Airport on the northern edge of Severn. The highway passes between the airport property to the north and a residential area on the south. MD 176 intersects MD 652 (Old Telegraph Road) and WB&A Road and passes the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area. The highway gains a median and reaches the eastern end of its portion of Airport Loop at its junction with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard) at the southern edge of Ferndale. East of MD 162, MD 176 has an incomplete partial cloverleaf interchange with I-97. The missing movement, from southbound I-97 to MD 176, is handled via MD 162. The state highway becomes undivided just before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard) in Glen Burnie. This intersection is adjacent to one of two southern ends of the Baltimore Light Rail; the terminal station, Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie, is accessed via MD 648. The junction is also next to the northern end of the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail. The eastern leg of the intersection is 8th Avenue N.W.   HistoryMD 176 was constructed as a concrete road from MD 3 (later US 301 and now MD 648) in Glen Burnie west to the B&O Railroad crossing at Dorsey at the Anne Arundel–Howard county line in 1929.   The connection between the railroad crossing and US 1—the highway intersected US 1 just south of the modern US 1–MD 100 interchange—remained a county highway until 1936.  Work on MD 176's grade separations of the B&O Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad at Dorsey and Harmans, respectively, were underway by 1936.  MD 176's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was finished in 1936 and its underpass of the B&O Railroad was complete by 1938.   The old alignment of MD 176 at Harmans became MD 645. MD 176 has also had two other railroad crossings. The highway crossed over the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway on a "weak and narrow wooden bridge" until 1944, when the bridge over the abandoned railroad was removed and the railroad embankment was filled.  By 1951, MD 176 had an underpass of the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad immediately to the west of US 301 that has since been removed. MD 176 was widened and resurfaced over its whole length between 1947 and 1950.    The highway was expanded to a width of   from Dorsey to Harmans and to   from Harmans to Glen Burnie.  The MD 295–MD 176 interchange was built as a diamond interchange between 1950 and 1953; a loop ramp from eastbound MD 176 to northbound MD 295 was added in 1956.   The highway's interchange with the Glen Burnie Bypass, which started as US 301, became MD 3, and is now I-97, was constructed as a diamond interchange between 1954 and 1956.   MD 176 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of its interchange with MD 3 (now I-97) by 1978.  The remainder of MD 176 from the west end of the divided highway to just east of MD 295 was expanded to four lanes in the late 1980s, with the bridge of Piney Run between MD 295 and MD 713 rebuilt in 1987 and the railroad overpass at Harmans rebuilt in 1989.  MD 176 was superseded by MD 100 in the early to mid-1990s. MD 176 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of its interchange with MD 295, which was rebuilt as a cloverleaf interchange, in 1992 and 1993. By the latter year, MD 100 was under construction from US 1 to I-97.   MD 100 was completed in 1995; the freeway took over as the east–west highway through the MD 295 interchange. MD 176 was temporarily assigned to Wright Road, Race Road, and Faulkner Road to connect the portions of the highway on either side of the interchange. Also in 1995, the highway was relocated to the current double-curve roadway to the US 1–MD 103 intersection.  MD 103 was extended over that relocation east to its present eastern terminus and MD 176 was truncated at its present western terminus by 1997.  The portion of this detour on Wright Road over MD 295 was retained in the state system and designated MD 176B.   The highway's interchange with I-97 was reconstructed to its present form by 1999.   Junction list                  Auxiliary routes  MD 176B is the designation for the   section of Wright Road from Race Road east to a right-angle turn north; this segment includes the highway's bridge over MD 295.   This section of highway was part of MD 176's detour along Wright Road, Race Road, and Faulkner Road when MD 100 assumed MD 176's interchange with MD 295 around 1995.  All but what is now MD 176B and the bridge over MD 100, which became MD 100N, were transferred back to county maintenance by 1997.   MD 176C is the designation for Binder Lane, a   section of the old alignment of MD 176 from MD 103 northwest to a dead end adjacent to US 1's interchange with MD 100 west of Dorsey in Howard County.   MD 176C was assigned by 1999 after MD 176 (now MD 103) was relocated to the double-curve section east of US 1 in 1995.     See also      References  External links   MDRoads: MD 176    
Maryland Route 14  Maryland Route 14 (MD 14) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway runs   from MD 16 near Secretary east to MD 313 in Eldorado.  MD 14 connects those two towns with the towns of East New Market and Brookview in northern Dorchester County.  The state highway also shares a concurrency with MD 331 between the communities of Rhodesdale and Shiloh Church.  The sections of MD 14 between East New Market and Eldorado were constructed between 1911 and 1914.  The highway through Secretary was constructed in the late 1920s.  The portion of MD 14 east of Shiloh Church was first marked as part of U.S. Route 213 (US 213) in 1927.  In the early 1930s, US 213 was rerouted through Vienna; as a result, MD 14 was extended to its present eastern terminus in Eldorado. Route descriptionMD 14 begins at an intersection with MD 16 (Mt. Holly Road) a short distance west of East New Market.  The state highway heads north as Secretary Road in a straight line before curving to the east and crossing the Warwick River, where the highway's name changes to Main Street and the route enters the town of Secretary.  MD 14 intersects Poplar Street, which leads to the Suicide bridge over Cabin Creek, before leaving the town.   The state highway's name changes to Secretary East New Market Road as the road turns southeast toward the second town.  MD 14 passes through East New Market on Academy Road and Railroad Avenue, with the name change occurring at the center of town at the highway's second intersection with MD 16, known at this point as Main Street.  After intersecting MD 392 (East New Market Bypass) and crossing the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, MD 14 leaves the town limits of East New Market.  MD 14 continues east as East New Market Rhodesdale Road.  The state highway passes North Dorchester High School before the western intersection with MD 331 (Shiloh Church Hurlock Road) in the hamlet of Shiloh Church.  MD 14 and MD 331 head east in a concurrency to the community of Rhodesdale, where MD 331 splits to the southeast toward Vienna as Rhodesdale Vienna Road.  MD 14 crosses an unused rail line owned by Delmarva Power and Light Company and continues east as Rhodesdale Eldorado Road.  The state highway curves northeast and briefly passes through the town of Brookview before crossing Marshyhope Creek.  Shortly after crossing the creek, MD 14 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 313 in the town of Eldorado.  MD 313 continues northeast as Eldorado Road and southeast as Sharptown Road.   HistoryThe first section of MD 14 to be constructed as a modern highway was between East New Market and Shiloh Church in 1911.  The next two sections were constructed as part of the major north–south highway of the Eastern Shore; the Shiloh Church–Brookview segment was built in 1912 and the Brookview–Eldorado portion was completed in 1914.   When route numbers were first assigned in 1927, MD 14 was placed on the western section and US 213 was marked on the two eastern sections.   MD 14 between Secretary and East New Market was constructed in 1926 and 1927.    The final section between the western junction with MD 16 and Secretary was paved in 1929 and 1930.    While the modern bridge over Marshyhope Creek at Brookview was completed in 1932, it served a lighter traffic load than the previous bridge because of the opening of a new bridge over the Nanticoke River at Vienna the previous year.   By 1933, US 213 was relocated through Vienna and MD 14's eastern terminus was moved from Shiloh Church to Eldorado.   MD 14's concurrency with US 213 became a concurrency with MD 331 in 1939 when the two latter highways swapped corridors due to the completion of the new Choptank River Bridge in 1935.

Maryland Route 313  Maryland Route 313 is a state highway located on the  Eastern Shore of Maryland in the United States. The   route runs from U.S. Route 50 in Mardela Springs, Wicomico County north to Maryland Route 213 and Maryland Route 290 in Galena, Kent County. It is predominantly a rural two-lane road that runs through agricultural areas a short distance west of the Delaware border, with the exception of a four-lane divided bypass of Denton shared with Maryland Route 404. MD 313 serves many communities, including Sharptown, Eldorado, Federalsburg,  Denton, Greensboro, Goldsboro, Barclay, Sudlersville, Millington, and Massey. The route intersects many major roads, including Maryland Route 54 in Mardela Springs, Maryland Route 404 in the Denton area, Maryland Route 302 in Barclay, Maryland Route 300 in Sudlersville, and U.S. Route 301 near Massey.The designation MD 313 was first used prior to 1927 for the road running from Eldorado to Galena, while the portion south to Mardela Springs was designated a part of U.S. Route 213. By 1940, the route was extended to Mardela Springs following a realignment of US 213. A few realignments to MD 313 had occurred by 1960 including one that moved the route to a new road between Federalsburg and Denton. In the 1980s, a four-lane divided bypass of Denton was built and the former alignment of MD 313 in the town became Maryland Route 619. This divided highway was extended further south of Denton in the early 2000s. The remaining two-lane portions of MD 313 that are concurrent with MD 404 are slated to be upgraded to a four-lane divided highway to provide relief to beach traffic along MD 404, a part of the main route between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware beaches. Route descriptionMD 313 runs through rural areas of woods and farms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, generally a short distance west of the Delaware border. The route heads through five counties in Maryland from south to north: Wicomico, Dorchester, Caroline, Queen Anne's, and Kent. It connects several towns including Mardela Springs and Sharptown in Wicomico County, Eldorado in Dorchester County, Federalsburg, Denton, Greensboro and Goldsboro in Caroline County, Barclay and Sudlersville in Queen Anne's County, and Millington and Galena in Kent County.    Wicomico County Maryland Route 313 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 50 in Mardela Springs, Wicomico County, where the route heads east past residences along Delmar Road, a   two-lane undivided road. A short distance past US 50, the route turns north onto Sharptown Road, with Maryland Route 54 continuing east on Delmar Road toward the Delaware-Maryland state border town of Delmar.   The route continues north past more residences, with the speed limit increasing to   and then to   as it leaves Mardela Springs and heads into farmland a short distance west of the Delaware border.   It continues through a mix of woods and farms with some residences before reaching Sharptown.  Here, the road intersects Maryland Route 813F (Twiford Road). MD 313 bypasses Sharptown to the south and intersects Maryland Route 348 (Laurel Road).   Past this intersection, the route turns north and runs along the eastern edge of the town before crossing over the Nanticoke River.  Dorchester CountyUpon crossing the Nanticoke River, MD 313 enters Dorchester County and heads northwest through wooded areas before continuing into a mix of woodland and farmland. It turns west before heading northwest again and reaching the town of Eldorado.   Here, the speed limit drops to   and the route intersects the eastern terminus of Maryland Route 14 (Rhodesdale Eldorado Road).  At this intersection, MD 313  makes a right turn to head north on Eldorado Road. The route leaves Eldorado and the speed limit increases to   again as it continues through farmland with some patches of woods.    It intersects Maryland Route 392 (Finchville Reliance Road) in Finchville and passes more farming areas with intermittent residences before coming to an intersection with Maryland Route 577 (Reliance Road) on the Caroline County border in Allens Corner.   Caroline CountyAt the MD 577 intersection, MD 313 runs northwest along the border of Caroline and Dorchester counties as Reliance Road. The speed limit decreases to   as the route heads toward the town of Federalsburg, passing through a mix of agricultural and residential areas. The route then leaves the border line and enters Caroline County, intersecting Maryland Route 318 (Federalsburg Highway) and making a left turn to form a concurrency with that route.   The two routes bypass Federalsburg to the south as a   road, crossing over Marshyhope Creek.     After crossing the creek, the road intersects Maryland Route 308 (South Main Street).  The road passes an industrial park before turning north into wooded areas and crossing a Maryland & Delaware Railroad line. After the railroad crossing, MD 313 and MD 318 intersect Maryland Route 307 (Williamsburg Road) at a roundabout located in the southwestern corner of Federalsburg. A short distance later, MD 318 splits from MD 313 by heading west on Preston Road while Maryland Route 315 continues east into Federalsburg on Bloomingdale Avenue.   Past this intersection, MD 313 continues north on the Federalsburg Highway, leaving the Federalsburg area and heading into a mix of woodland and farmland. In Andersontown, MD 313 intersects Maryland Route 16 and Maryland Route 404  (Shore Highway), which constitutes a part of the main route between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware beaches.     Here, the route makes a left turn onto that road, forming a three-route concurrency.  At this point, the Shore Highway has a speed limit of   and heads northwest through a mix of woods and farms with some homes before widening to a four-lane divided highway. Upon widening into a divided highway, MD 16 splits from MD 313 and MD 404 at an intersection and heads west on Harmony Road. Past this intersection, MD 313 crosses over Watts Creek and heads north through farmland, passing Martinak State Park. The speed limit decreases to   as the road heads into commercial areas in the southern part of Denton. The road turns northeast into woods and intersects the eastern terminus of Maryland Route 404 Business (Franklin Street/Gay Street) at an at-grade intersection. Past this intersection, MD 313 and MD 404 become a   limited-access road and head north, passing residential neighborhoods and woodland along the eastern side of Denton.   The road turns to the west and comes to a diamond interchange. Here MD 313 splits from MD 404 by heading north on two-lane undivided Greensboro Road and Maryland Route 619, while the former routing of MD 313 in Denton heads south into Denton on Sixth Street. The route heads through farmland before passing residences as a   road and intersecting the western terminus of Maryland Route 317 (Burrsville Road) in Oil City. Past MD 317, the speed limit increases to   and the road continues through mostly wooded areas with some residences and farmland.  It reaches the town of Greensboro, where the speed limit drops to   and MD 313 intersects Maryland Route 314 (Whiteleysburg Road). The route crosses the Choptank River past MD 314, with the speed limit increasing to   and then to   before the intersection with the eastern terminus of Maryland Route 480 (Ridgely Road) just north of Greensboro.   The road continues north through agricultural areas before entering Goldsboro, where the speed limit decreases to   and it becomes Old Town Road.   In Goldsboro, MD 313 intersects  Maryland Route 311 (Main Street) and continues through residential areas before coming to an intersection with Maryland Route 287 (Old Line Road). Here, the route makes a left turn to head west on Goldsboro Road. MD 313 leaves Goldsboro and becomes a   road that heads into a mix of farmland and woodland. The road intersects unsigned Maryland Route 820 (Castle Hall Road). Past this intersection, MD 313 turns to the northwest and intersects the northern terminus of Maryland Route 312 (Oakland Road) in Baltimore Corner, where it heads north through farm fields past that intersection.   Queen Anne's CountyMD 313 crosses Long Marsh Ditch into Queen Anne's County and continues north through more farmland, before intersecting the eastern terminus of Maryland Route 19 (Roberts Station Road) in Ingleside. The route proceeds north, with a traffic count of 2,270 vehicles at the Merrick Corner Road intersection, before reaching the town of Barclay. Here, the road passes residences with a speed limit of   and intersects Maryland Route 302 (Church Street). Past this intersection, the road crosses a Maryland & Delaware Railroad line before leaving Barclay and heading back into agricultural areas as a   road.   The Maryland & Delaware Railroad line runs a short distance to the east of MD 313 before eventually running next to the road as it passes through a mix of farms, woods, and residences.  The route enters Sudlersville, where the speed limit decreases to   and it passes through residential areas in the town on Church Street, with the railroad line drawing farther to the east. In the center of town, the road intersects Maryland Route 300 (Main Street). Past the MD 300 intersection, MD 313 intersects Maryland Route 837 (Church Circle), an unsigned loop to westbound MD 300. Upon leaving Sudlersville, the route becomes   Millington Road and heads north through farm fields with intermittent residences.   MD 313 heads into forested areas as it runs a short distance to the east of U.S. Route 301. It leaves the woodland as it intersects the eastern terminus of Maryland Route 544 (Mcginnis Road).  The route heads northeast through a mix of agricultural and residential areas before turning east in a patch of woodland and passing more farm fields and residences.  MD 313 turns northeast into wooded residential areas and enters Millington, where it becomes   Sassafras Street.   Kent CountyMD 313 crosses the Chester River into Kent County, where it continues north through Millington and crosses Maryland Route 291 (Cypress Street).   The road passes more residences before leaving Millington and becoming Millington Massey Road, a   road that passes by farmland and some residences. MD 313 reaches Massey, where it passes by residences as a   road before coming to an intersection at the center of town where it makes a left turn onto Massey Galena Road. It is here that Maryland Route 299 heads north on Massey Road and Maryland Route 330 heads east on Massey Delaware Line Road.   The route leaves Massey and heads west through farm fields as a   road, crossing another Maryland & Delaware Railroad line before heading northwest into forested areas.    The route intersects the multi-lane, divided U.S. Route 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection in which traffic on MD 313 cannot continue directly across US 301 and must use a U-turn ramp in the median of that route.  Past the US 301 intersection, the route officially becomes Maryland Route 313A, but is still signed as Maryland Route 313. It heads west through farmland before turning north and intersecting Maryland Route 290 (Chesterville Road).   The two routes continue north together into Galena, where the speed limit drops to   and the road becomes Main Street.   It passes residences before intersecting Maryland Route 213 (Main Street) in the center of town where MD 313 ends, MD 290 turns east on Cross Street, and MD 213 goes northbound on Main Street and southbound by going west on Cross Street.  HistoryThe designation MD 313 was in use by 1927 for the road running from Eldorado to Galena, while the current route between Mardela Springs and Eldorado designated as a part of U.S. Route 213, which ran from Ocean City to Elkton.  By 1940, US 213 was realigned to follow present-day US 50 between Mardela Springs and Easton, and MD 313 was extended south to end at US 213 in Mardela Springs.    By 1960, a few realignments of MD 313 had taken place. The route was moved to its current alignment between Federalsburg and Denton after originally following American Corner Road and MD 16 between the two towns. In addition, the route was rerouted to bypass Greensboro instead of passing through the town on Sunset Avenue (present-day MD 314) and Main Street (present-day MD 480) and a bypass of MD 313 was built east of Ingleside in place of following Roberts Station Road (present-day MD 19) and St. Paul Road.     In the early 1980s, a four-lane divided bypass of Denton was constructed for MD 313 and MD 404, with the alignment of MD 313 through Denton became MD 619.  A superstreet intersection was built at US 301 in 2000, resulting in the northern terminus of MD 313 being officially moved to US 301 and the portion of the route between US 301 and MD 213 being designated MD 313A.    Despite this, MD 313A is still signed as MD 313.  The divided highway portion of the route in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection south of where MD 16 joins the route.  This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001.  The remaining two-lane portions of MD 313 that are concurrent with MD 404 are slated to be widened into a four-lane divided highway in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts along MD 404.

Maryland Route 287  Maryland Route 287 (MD 287) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for much of its length as Sandtown Road, the state highway runs   from MD 313 in Goldsboro east to the Delaware state line, where the highway continues east as Delaware Route 10 (DE 10).  MD 287 was constructed in the early 1930s. Route descriptionMD 287 begins at an intersection with MD 313 on the northwest edge of Goldsboro.  MD 313 heads south into the town as Oldtown Road and west as Goldsboro Road.  MD 287 heads east as Old Line Road along the northern edge of Goldsboro.  After intersecting MD 311 (Main Street) and crossing an unused railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation, the state highway's name changes to Sandtown Road and it heads east through farmland, crossing Broadway Branch and the upper part of the Choptank River.  MD 287 reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line, where the highway continues east as DE 10 (Willow Grove Road) toward Dover.   HistoryMD 287 was constructed starting in 1930 and completed by 1933.   Junction list          See also      References  External links   MDRoads: MD 287    
Maryland Route 824  Maryland Route 824 (MD 824) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as Blythedale Road, the state highway runs   from MD 222 north to MD 222 and MD 275 within Perryville in southwestern Cecil County.  MD 824 is the old alignment of U.S. Route 222, which is now MD 222, in Perryville.  MD 824 was designated on the old road after US 222 was realigned for its interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) in the early 1960s. Route descriptionMD 824 begins at an intersection with MD 222 (Perryville Road) and the entrance to Perryville Outlet Center between downtown Perryville and MD 222's interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway).  The state highway starts east as Reservoir Road but immediately turns north along two-lane Blythedale Road through a forested area with scattered residences.  After passing under I-95 and intersecting Principio Road, MD 824 curves to the west toward its northern terminus at a four-way intersection with MD 222 and MD 275.  MD 222 heads south toward the I-95 interchange as Perryville Road and west as Bainbridge Road toward Port Deposit, while MD 275 and MD 222 Truck head north as Perrylawn Drive toward Rising Sun.   HistoryMD 824 is the old alignment of US 222 (now MD 222).   Blythedale Road was paved by 1921.   MD 824 was assigned to Blythedale Road after MD 222 was moved to its present alignment for its interchange with I-95 in 1963.

Maryland Route 302  Maryland Route 302 (MD 302) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as Barclay Road, the state highway runs   from U.S. Route 301 (US 301) near Barclay east to the Delaware state line near Templeville, where the highway continues east as Delaware Route 11 (DE 11).  MD 302 follows the Queen Anne's–Caroline county line for part of its length near Templeville.  The county line road is considered to be in Caroline County for maintenance purposes.   MD 302 was first paved in Barclay in the early 1920s and from Templeville to the state line in the late 1920s.  The gap between Barclay and Templeville was filled in the late 1930s.  MD 302 was extended west toward Church Hill in the late 1940s and to US 301 in the mid-1960s. Route descriptionMD 302 begins at an intersection with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) about midway between Church Hill and Barclay.  Hall Road continues west as a county highway toward Church Hill.  MD 302 heads east as two-lane Barclay Road through farmland.  The state highway crosses Red Lion Branch just before entering the town of Barclay, where the highway's name changes to Church Street.  MD 302 crosses the Centreville Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad and intersects MD 313 (Goldsboro Road).  The state highway becomes Barclay Road again upon leaving the town limits and passes through a mix of farmland and forest.  The state highway runs atop the Queen Anne's–Caroline county line starting just before the intersection with Woodyard Road.  MD 302 passes through the town of Templeville, where the highway intersects MD 454 (Crown Stone Road).  East of the town, shortly after crossing Beaver Dam Ditch, MD 302 reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line.  The highway continues east as DE 11 (Arthursville Road) toward Hartly.   HistoryThe first section of MD 302 was about   east from MD 313 in Barclay paved in 1923.   A second, unconnected section was completed between Templeville and the Delaware state line in 1930.    The gap between Barclay and Templeville was filled in 1939.    MD 302 was extended west about   toward Church Hill in 1949.    The state highway reached its present length when it was extended to US 301 in 1966.  Junction listMD 302 follows the Queen Anne's–Caroline county line from just west of Woodyard Road near Templeville to the Delaware state line.  The county line portion is considered to be in Caroline County for maintenance purposes.             See also      References  External links   MDRoads: MD 302       
Maryland Route 342  Maryland Route 342 (MD 342) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as St. Augustine Road, the state highway runs   from MD 310 in St. Augustine north to unsigned MD 537 in Chesapeake City in southern Cecil County.  MD 342 was constructed in its entirety by 1915. Route descriptionMD 342 begins at an intersection with MD 310 (Cayots Corner Road) in St. Augustine.  The state highway heads northeast as a narrow two-lane road through farmland.  MD 342 makes a right-angle turn to the northwest, curves to the west, then takes a sharp turn to the north through a forested area and scattered residences.  Just east of the southern end of the Chesapeake City Bridge, the state highway enters the town of Chesapeake City and intersects an unnamed road (unsigned MD 537D) that leads to ramps to MD 213 (Augustine Herman Highway).  MD 342 continues a short distance to its northern terminus at an oblique junction with George Street, which is unsigned MD 537C and leads to MD 286 in the South Chesapeake City Historic District.   HistoryMD 342 was paved from George Street to just south of the right-angle turn by 1910.   The remainder of the road to St. Augustine and MD 310 east of St. Augustine were built as a state-aid road by 1915.    MD 342 has changed very little since then.

Maryland State Highway 896 
Maryland Route 537  Maryland Route 537 is an unsigned state highway in Cecil County, Maryland running through Chesapeake City. The highway is divided into three segments, all of which are designated with a lettered suffix. A piece of Maryland 537 begins as a branch from Maryland 284 in Chesapeake City, continuing as Lock Street southward through the city past Maryland 285, and stopping at Bank Street and the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Across the canal, the route picks up again in the same direction as George Street, crossing Maryland 286, and then ending at the Augustine Herman Highway (Maryland 213). Maryland Route 537 used to cross MD 213 and parallel it along Basil Road before rejoining it; however, this section has been removed from the state highway system.Maryland 537 is the original route of Maryland 213 through Chesapeake City, which was diverted when a different site was found for a high bridge across the canal. The current bridge on Maryland 213 was opened in 1949 after the earlier vertical lift bridge connecting George Street with Lock Street was destroyed in an accident with the tanker Franz Klasen in 1942. Route description MD 537A and DOriginally, Maryland Route 537 extended down to near the Chesapeake City city limits along Route 537A. The highway began at an intersection with Maryland Route 213 in Chesapeake City. The highway went northward along Basil Avenue, paralleling the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal for its entire length. At the interchange with Route 213 (as it approached the Chesapeake City Bridge) in Chesapeake City, the 537A designation ended, and the highway currently continues as Maryland Route 537D.   Maryland Route 537D, after the off-ramp from Maryland 213, continues the right-of-way of Basil Avenue and heads under the Chesapeake City Bridge, which towers above. A short distance after the bridge, Route 537D terminates at an intersection Route 537C (George Street), another segment of Maryland Route 537.    MD 537B and CMaryland Route 537C begins at the same interchange where Maryland Route 537D had begun to the west. The highway progresses to the northeast along George Street, paralleling to the east of Maryland Route 213. After a short distance, the highway enters the city and intersects with the northern terminus of Maryland Route 537D. The highway continues to the northeast, intersects with the northern terminus of Maryland Route 342. After that intersection, the highway heads into the downtown part of the city. It intersects with 4th Street, a one-way highway and provides as the eastern terminus of Maryland Route 286, locally known as 2nd Street. A short distance after the intersection with Route 286, Route 537C terminates at the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.     Across the canal, Lock Street begins at the location of the former locks along the Canal in Chesapeake City. The locally street, designated as Maryland Route 537B heads northward through the residential district and terminates at Maryland Route 285 (Lock Street and Biddle Street) in Chesapeake City.    HistoryWhen Maryland's state highway system was created, the alignment of Maryland Route 537B and Maryland Route 537C, along with nearby Route 285, was originally an alignment of U.S. Route 213.  The bridge over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which carried the alignment of U.S. Route 213, was destroyed when a tanker, Franz Klasen, collided with it in 1942.    U.S. Route 213 was kept on the alignment for seven years, until 1949, when the current-day Chesapeake City Bridge was constructed and Route 213 was realigned onto it.    The highway was later re-designated as Maryland Routes 537B and 537C.
