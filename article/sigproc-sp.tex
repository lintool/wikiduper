% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1

% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file

\title{Similar Article Detection Using Minhash Technique on Wikipedia\titlenote{This effort is part of the CMSC828G, Data Intensive Computing with MapReduce, class project.}}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{5} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and

In this paper, we describe a novel similarity detection algorithm that utilizes locality sensitive hashing technique on MapReduce framework. The algorithm has been designed and implemented to detect similar articles using large Wikipedia dumps, in compressed or uncompressed forms.

\section{Introduction}
Wikipedia has a history of generating controversy over editorial quality and factual correctness. Although some studies have found Wikipediaâ€™s accuracy to rival that of traditional encyclopedias, other studies have found numerous factual errors [1]. Since Wikipedia may be edited anonymously, information is often freely copied between web sources or other Wikipedia articles. Additionally, many articles in Wikipedia lack citations. There is little mechanism for detecting and correcting such errors. One potential source of error on Wikipedia is factual information that varies over time and is not updated. Wilkinson found that the distribution of article edits has a long tail, meaning that a small number of articles have many edits while most articles have few, and that number of edits is directly related to article quality. Articles with low edits, and low editorial attention, are less likely to be updated when new information becomes available \cite{wilkinson:wiki}.

As a step toward identifying factual errors, we investigated the problem of finding near duplicate sentences on Wikipedia. Such near duplicate sentences may reflect factual information that has been updated in one article and not another, or merely inconsistencies that should be flagged and addressed. We used the MapReduce computing framework and locality sensitive hashing techniques to compare sentences and identify near duplicates.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present related work, in Section 3, we explain the algorithm utilizing locality sensitive hashing, in Section 4, we present the working application within MapReduce framework. In Section 5, we discuss our experiments with various Wikipedia datasets. The final section contains concluding remarks and future work.
